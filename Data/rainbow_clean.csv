My boyfriend came out to me as bi,glassAdvertiser,ainbow,"Hi everyone, I really need some advice! 

My boyfriend who Ive been with more than a year told me that he is feeling attracted to men as well as he does to women in some sort of way. I was really surprised to hear that because its just something id never expect from him. 

Weve talked about it together and he said that hes still figuring it out but hes heavily leaning towards being bi/fin. He wanted to clear it up that he doesnt want to date guys, or let any guy to be the dominant one on him in sexual interactions.

He told me about what fin-sexuality is, it is being attracted to feminine people regardless of their gender and that he is attracted to the idea of feminine guys and guys who are dressed as women. 

I need advice on how to be supportive and help him get through his figuring out phase. I do not know a lot about LGBTQ community but I do want to learn. I want to be as supportive as I can. He means the world to me. 

He wanted me to be as open as i want and ask him questions without any hesitation. What kind of questions would help me understand what hes going through? What can I do to help him feel supported about this specific topic? 

Id also really appreciate it if you can explain a little to me what it was like for you to realize your sexuality. Just so I can have an understanding. 

Please note that I really do not know a lot about LGBTQ community and willing to learn and this post does not aim to offend anyone. 

Thank you for reading!"

My coworkers today were talking about how much the LGBTQ community is being forced in our faces. What they were specifically referring to was some Super Bowl commercials primarily. They were also referring to commercials, TV and movies in general having a more LGBTQ friendly theme. 

I say its high time we had such representation in my opinion theres not enough. If you look back at how the LGBTQ community has been treated since really the beginning of time but specifically since say the 40s and 50s forward. We were brutalized we were beaten killed, you couldnt get together at a bar without it being underground or be out and proud until maybe the mid to late 90s in some areas. 

If you did try to get together openly your place was probably burned out or had graffiti painted on it using all kind of slurs and name-calling. So I say for a change its good to see some positive representation going on its good to see people are more tolerant than they used to be, now by any means its not perfect but it is definitely much better. Now you can openly go to gay bars or promote that your restaurant or other business is LGBTQ friendly. 

It does my heart good now when I turn on Netflix or other streaming apps and see that they have categories specifically designed for LGBTQ shows. I know some of you still live in countries or in areas or its not quite as good as others but just know we are still fighting to make improvements worldwide. 

Hopefully before my lifetime is over I will see a worldwide acceptance of those of us who are in the LGBTQ community and people will hate us because of who we are they will realize that you know what they were born that way they cant help who they love. 

Love dad"

I've just sent my wife a letter explaining to her that I need to confess some things about myself that I've kept buried for a long time and that might contradict her more traditional view of normal. As I expected, her reaction was very loving, kind and patient. I'm ready to tell her, but now that the moment has come, I'm not sure what exactly I \*am\* trying to tell her. So here's the short of it...  


I'm AMAB, 27. I've always had an interest in both the male and female sex, and now more recently, any identity or sexuality!That bit isn't really what I'm worried about. I could go through life never confessing any particular sexual preference to my wife other than what she assumes already because I love her and plan to remain faithful to her all my life, and our bedroom life is thriving and happybut I could be more comfortable and have less anxiety. Where I have an issue is in a more inward direction.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was young (probably up to high school) I never really thought about gender much. I experimented with men and women growing up, and liked both. I was who I was and who I was raised to beI never questioned my own gender, I just wore and did whatever I wanted to, except that I always allowed my more CIS Male upbringing to win out, keeping my flirtation with other guys a secret and publicly presenting as male and acting masculine. High school came around and I started to notice a bit of envy towards women. I wanted to be beautiful and wear girly clothes and have a curvy form and all that, and I noticed myself forming in the opposite direction. I didn't think much of it then, just sort of tossed the thoughts away as a phase. I even \*nearly\* got into two different relationships with gay friends but chickened out at the last moment when it came time to put a label on things or when feelings were confessed.  


Fast forward to now, I'm married to a wonderful woman that I love, and we even have a kid on the way. I'm happy with those two aspects of my life without a doubt, but there are some sensations and aspects of my personality that I continue to have confusion over. I still want to wear traditionally girly clothing, I want to do some girly things, I want to act more feminine. Most embarrassingly, I've been in this cycle over the last few months of buying, using and enjoying feminine adult toys and then throwing them away because the anxiety of getting caught with them or having them found while my wife cleans the house gets to be too much. That's getting stupid expensive and I just don't want to have to hide \*anything\* from her. Whatever this is, I just want to know, and I want to be open and honest about it with the ones I love so it doesn't ever become a problem or a continued source of deception. She sees me as a CIS straight male and I want her to see me for what I really am inside... Which is... I'm not sure.  


Am I a man? I don't know. I've always felt different than other men. I've always wanted to be a girlOr at least, I always imagine what it would be like and I'm pleased with those thoughts. I get so happy and then immediately depressed by the realization that I could probably never be that fantasy person for so many reasons. But \*AM\* I a girl? I don't know. Would I undergo SRS? No. I love that my wife and I can have kids naturally, and I love pleasing her and a change there would be too much for her to handle, I think. Would I undergo ERT? Maybe. This seems like the least dramatic way to lean towards my feminine side. FFS? I really need this the most (Super masculine chin and nose), but I'm not sure I'd ever go through with it for the sake of my friends, family and coworkers (Extremely male dominated field and it'd be too rough a change for them).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to ramble and I'm not even sure what else to add. What am I? If it helps you help me, I'd love to answer any questions. And if any of this has come off as insensitive, I'm sorry for that. I just have no idea how to present it."

Internalized Homophobia,Awkward-Butterfly893,ainbow,"I'm sorry in advance.

About three weeks ago, this huge fight happened between my friends. I did a stupid thing. There was a lot of dead naming and using the wrong pronouns (I didn't do this thankfully). I sided with the people that did that, and not the person that was getting targeted by it. They're not my friend anymore. 

I realized that I was homophobic and maybe transphobic. They were the only person that it affected, but I still want to be a better person. It's to a point where I'm pretty accepting of everybody in the LGBTQ community :D. It was never to the point of leaving hate comments, there were just thoughts in my head that are now mostly eliminated. The problem is, I still have a ton of internalized homophobia. I feel like I don't have a place in the community due to taking the wrong side and messing up with the same person two times. I also have realized that I've always hated my sexuality since day one. I truly wish I were straight. I hate that I can't accept that I'm probably sexually attracted to women and that I'm aceflux. 

Also, the side I chose. They're transphobic. The person I am dating is the most transphobic out of all of them. He doesn't want to accept them and seems to hate everyone who has changed their name and pronouns. I don't know what to do. I can't break up with him due to loving and stuffs. I'm genuinely scared to discuss my sexuality with him or talk to him about it. This has only started happening recently with him.

Before I get into this, I'm going to be using a throwaway here because my boyfriend also uses reddit pretty often. I'm probably going to take this down soon so that he doesn't see it, but I still really need advice right now, and I don't want to ask any of his friends how he is doing because he told me he just wants to be left alone. There will be a TLDR at the bottom, because this post is going to be pretty long, so warning in advance. Thanks.

So, my BF had his 20th birthday last Saturday. (We have been together officially for seven months now, but we've been talking/hooking up for around ten). To be honest, the news caught me by complete surprise. In my family, we would always throw big parties for each other, and invite all of our family. It got to the point that we would be working on it at least a week or two in advance, and we always worked hard to make everything about it perfect. I love planning family parties and tend to be really on top of this stuff, so I was really surprised when he just mentioned his birthday in passing to me like it was no big thing. I asked him if he had any plans, or if he wanted to do anything special for it, but he told me that he didn't really want to. I asked him if maybe his parents were going to do anything with him, and he got really quiet. I felt sort of confused by this, for a number of reasons. He's in general a very outgoing person, and loves talking and hanging out with people, but when it comes to personal details about himself, he tends to clam up. Ever since finals last semester, he's been really down. He keeps telling me that everything is fine, but his actions speak louder than his words. Any time that I asked him if something was wrong, he would just brush it off as mild seasonal depression, or just dealing with a cold, or some other excuse. He would perk up after that, but it felt like he was only doing it so I wouldn't worry.

I wanted to do something nice for him, especially since he's seemed a little upset after the holidays, so I subtly hinted to him that I wanted to go somewhere special. I told him that it could just be us if he didn't want to worry about inviting a ton of friends. (He's an ambivert, so sometimes he's super outgoing with people, but other times he just likes to be on his own). He seemed to be okay with this, so we set up a plan for his big day. We ended up planning to go to this really nice sushi place (he told me he's never had sushi before!) and then we would go out and get cheesecake for dessert. Afterwards, we planned to spend the night at my apartment and binge-watch some movies that he likes. He really seemed to like this plan, and he told me that he was looking forward to it. The week before his birthday I could tell that he was feeling at least a little bit better, and he told me that he was very excited for Saturday. I was honestly just glad that I was finally able to cheer him up.

Eventually, Saturday came around, and we met up at my place around 3:30. Immediately I could tell that something was off about him. He didn't really want to make eye contact with me, and his face and cheeks were red. It looked like he had been upset/crying earlier, but I didn't want to say anything or point anything out. I mean, I get it. Everyone gets upset around holidays/birthdays sometime, it's no big deal. After hanging out in my apartment for about an hour or two, we decided to go on a walk around our city before going to the restaurant. After walking downtown for around 30 mins, we took my car to the sushi place and sat down for dinner. The restaurant was great, and he told me that it was some of the best food that he had ever had. After we had both finished eating, we talked for a while about how he was doing. He told me that he always gets pretty upset during the holidays and his birthday, but he was glad that we were out doing this. I told him that I was just happy that he was happy, and that he could tell me anytime if something was wrong. I could see tears welling up in his eyes, but he quickly wiped them away, and everything seemed to be back to normal.

After dessert, we both got into my car, and I told him that I wanted to talk to him about something serious. I told him that I loved him, and that I want to be a part of his future. He agreed and told me that he loved me too. After he said that, I heard him laugh under his breath. I asked him what was so funny, and he told me that we had dated longer than his parents did, before they got married. When he said this, I noticed his voice getting shaky, and he looked away from me, looking out the window. I asked him how his parents were doing, and he didn't respond. After sitting in silence for a few minutes, I started my car, and began the drive back home to my apartment. After what felt like an eternity, I asked him why he never talked about his family to me. After all, we have been together for almost seven months now, but I know nothing about his life before he became an adult. He dryly responded ""When did you start caring so much about my family? Last time I checked, you're fucking me, not them."" I felt my face get hot, but I didn't want to say anything I would regret, so I just held my tongue. I just sat there, feeling dumb and embarrassed, his hand limply held in mine.

We just sat in the car for what felt like hours, not talking to each other. Once I parked my car in the parking lot at my place, I asked him why he never wanted me to meet them. When we started dating, I told my parents about him a few months in, and after meeting they get along great together. I want to have that connection with his family too, but any time in the past that I brought it up he would change the subject. He still didn't answer me, so I kept prying about it until I heard him sort of choking up. Eventually, I just flat out asked him if he was too ashamed of being with me to tell his parents, and he started sobbing quietly, embarrassed. Once I realized he was upset, I immediately shut up, and apologized a million times, and I told him that I didn't mean it, and that I was only asking because I felt like he was hiding me from people.

He looked me in the eyes, his face bright red, and told me: ""My parents don't consider me their son anymore. They kicked me out. I haven't fucking talked to them in two years."" After he told me this, he got out of my car and slammed the passenger side door shut. I just sat there inside, shocked. I knew that he wasn't close with his parents (or any family members really), but I didn't know that they disowned him. He told me once that he grew up in a very conservative Christian environment, and that he was outed his senior year when he was seventeen. He's always struggled financially, and at one point worked two jobs along with school. I always chalked it up to him being incredibly motivated, but now I see that he was doing this because he had to in order to survive. I guess it makes sense why he gets so upset around the holidays and his birthday. He's had to tough it out alone for years now.

I got out of my car, and I confronted him outside of my building. He didn't look me in the eyes, instead he was focusing on his phone. I told him that I was so sorry, I had no idea, and that he means so much to me. I started tearing up, and my voice started breaking while I said all of this. He told me he was getting an Uber home, and that we could talk later. The driver pulled into the parking lot after ten minutes of us just standing outside in the cold, both crying. He got in, and the driver sped the car away. The next morning, I asked him if he was okay, and if he wanted to talk to me about anything, but he told me that he wanted to have some time to himself, to think about things. It's been a week now, and I am extremely worried for his physical and mental health. I'm scared that he would hurt himself. I want to call his roommate and ask if he is okay, but I don't want to violate his trust and try to make contact with him before he is ready. So, reddit, what should I do?

TLDR: I got in a fight with my boyfriend on his birthday about how he has never wanted to introduce me to his parents. I asked him if he was ashamed of our relationship, and he started crying, and told me that he was disowned, and that his parents don't consider him to be their son. We haven't talked in a week now, and I don't know if I should try to contact him or wait for him to want to talk to me."

my name is Lauren but my IRL name is that of a male I dont want to share.

So off my chest..

People would see me as a 26 year old male, with a girlfriend, and a career. whos just that. Ive been confused with my gender since I was little but just kept it under wraps. (I played with dolls and had all female friend groups in primary)

To the current day now, I have this idea in my head that I want to find a male partner, fall in love, treat him well and all the while presenting as a feminine being and making my male partner feel good. On the surface people would see me as a high maintenance guy (all I do is use what I deem the standard for skincare, shaving, keeping smooth and tan etc etc)

I regularly will completely transform myself into a fashionable, passable female, and feel so comfortable and ready to go out, then I feel a deep sense of shame and immediately hit reset and throw on the baggy guy clothes. I resonate with womans fashion, and always admire a well put together outfit in public. I even identify as a Lauren, and feel most comfortable when Im in my high rise jeans and a baggy print with a bra and underwear not meant for men. 

The NSFW part is on the sexual side, I have not had much, if at all any desire to be with women. I constantly find myself and my heart dreaming of laying with a man and experiencing giving him pleasure, feeling his embrace and being the receiver in intercourse. 

I grew up in a very traditional household and my dad wasnt really around, I grew up around my sisters..and have no idea what to do. What does this make me Im so lost.

For context: We are both 15 year old cis bisexual females in a catholic highschool. We dated for almost a year. This is both our first serious relationship. Her parents are homophobic while her sister is supportive of us. My family is pretty supportive. 

A few weeks back, we had agreed to become friends again- me doing 99% of the initiation of simple text conversation and just asking her how she is with her replying Fine. U. 

For the most part she was incredibly dry and seemed like she had no interest in me whatsoever. 

There was just one part where she asked me if I was going to do virtual or in person schooling. 

The way she asked made it seem like she wanted to avoid seeing me as much as possible and that really hurt me. 

I told her what I was going to do and our last conversation ended. 

Then a few weeks into school, she started to slowly unadd me on everything, last being leaving our friend group chat.

Me and my friends are confused on what shes doing and how shes doing. 

She had asked one of my friends in the group to hang out but my friend said no since they had work. 

Im so worried for her, and I dont know if shes doing this on her own disposition or her parents. 

Im so confused and hurt. Didnt she say we could be friends again? She told me that she never wants to lose me, and that Im too important to her while breaking up. 

I dont know what to do anymore. Should I suck this up and leave her alone for good? I still really care about her. 

Any advice would be deeply appreciated.

TL;DR: Ex girlfriend slowly unadded me on everything and left friend group chat after being forced by her homophobic parents to breakup with me. Feeling hurt and confused."

I completely humiliated myself and I need advice on how to make myself feel better,DoKno07,ainbow,"First off, I'm not too comfortable with my sexuality (I think I'm bisexual but I'm much more attracted to girls, I'm a girl too btw.), I think too much about what other people think of me, I get horrible anxiety because of this, even if it's my closest friends. So I only talk about it when I'm really drunk, and sometimes with the wrong people.

Recently I had an outing with coworkers, I already knew how I get when I'm drunk so I thought I'd just control my drinking. Well, long story short I failed. 
I don't even remember a few hours of the night but what I do remember is fucking horrible.
I kissed one of my guy coworkers, which is pretty embarrassing in itself and everyone was shook lol but that's not the part I worry about the most. (I don't even remember this , my other coworker told me )
Then I came out to my boss out of nowhere, and in the past I've heard her say homophobic comments, so I included that I didn't want to tell her because of that. And I probably repeated that a few dozen times as she was reassuring she doesn't mind and she's not homophobic (but this is really fuzzy too).
Maybe I even cried, I don't know.

So back to the time my coworker told me I kissed the guy, he then said he was surprised I haven't kissed the boss.
And I was like ""oh at least I'm not that fucking stupid""
And he was like ""ain't like you wasn't trying""
I was mortified, I don't have any recollection of this. 
I love my job, most of my coworkers are also friends, my boss too. We were on really great terms, she is a fantastic person, and now I fear that she hates me.

But the thing is, she texted me like nothing happened, we talked about how hungover we are and stuff like that. But she also said she remembers the night pretty well.

Still I'm so anxious about going back to work, I can't eat, I'm nauseas, my stomach hurts, I feel like I ruined my life. And the thing is, I absolutely deserve to feel like this. I knew what alcohol does to me, I knew I have a problem, I knew I can't contain myself if I drink that much. Still I did it. 
Sorry for the long post.

Tlrd: Got drunk with coworkers, kissed one of them, came out to my boss as bi, while repeating to her I didn't mean to tell her cause she's homophobic, then maybe even made a move on her and now I'm a mess."

What is the difference between bisexual and polysexual?,TTSolvernia,ainbow,"Sorry if this is not the right sub, but I could not find a conclusive answer for this question.

From what I have read on the LGBTQ wiki and other sources, bisexual appears to be ""the attraction to two or more genders"" and polysexual appears to be ""the attraction to more than one gender, but not all genders"". However, I have seen some controversy and varying opinion on the matter.

At first I thought bisexual meant 'attracted to exactly two genders', so I decided that polysexual fit me better, as I have found myself sexually attracted to virtually any gender identity or body configuration except for some masculine identities (namely: individuals with masculine pronouns, masculine bodies and a vagina. Not to imply they are unattractive, they just don't do anything for me.) However, upon learning the wide differences in opinion that various people seem to have about bisexuality, I am reconsidering my own views on the matter and whether I am more bisexual or polysexual. There are bisexuals who sincerely argue that bisexual means 'only attracted to two genders' and some who insist that it means 'attracted to two or more genders', so it is difficult for me to come to a conclusion.

Thus I would like to ask other people directly: what does 'bisexual' mean to you, and how does it differ from 'polysexual'?"

What is going on?,Adventurous-Round-21,ainbow,My girlfriend confided in me that she has wanted to have sex with another girl but keeps reassuring me that she isnt sexually attracted to girls in any way and never has been. She claims she doesnt look at other girls as attractive in any way but would still enjoy doing it with another girl. I feel like I dont understand and its making me insecure and worried purely because I dont have understanding or closure around the situation. We were both each others first and maybe Im worried once we are older she will regret not having experienced that. Im just confused and I dont know why I care. Is she bi but afraid to tell me? Idk we talked about is for so long and she continues to reassure me she isnt attracted to girls but that just doesnt make sense to me.
Struggling with understanding my sexuality ,inquiringmind333,ainbow,"
Ive been studying health and biology for about 10 years, I was diagnosed with autism as a child and it became an obsession to know what made me the way I was . 

I came out of the closet 3 years ago to my family members and close friends. Ive been studying factors that determine sexual orientation as well.

Along the way Ive come across some very interesting research. Im curious of everyones opinion.

This is a controversial topic but it deserves inquiry. I dont mean to offend or upset anyone by posting this.

Exposure to the toxin mercury from environmental pollution is clinically proven to turn heterosexual birds homosexual . It disrupts their endocrine system and causes changes in testosterone and estrogen in their bodies resulting in the change in sexual orientation. 

https://www.nature.com/articles/news.2010.641

https://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/03/01/i-team-impact-of-mercury-on-the-florida-ibis/?amp

This is the first time in documented history a conclusive environmental cause of homosexuality has been found in any species .

Due to environmental pollution we are all being exposed to this toxin the same way the birds were . Pollution goes up into the air and comes back down with the rain onto our crops, into our soil and into our water. Its in all of the food we eat, even high levels in all of the baby food 

 https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/02/22/baby-food-safety-heavy-metals-investigation-column/4506277001/

https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/health/baby-food-heavy-metal-toxins-wellness/index.html

There are no studies to date regarding this topic in humans. But it is proven that mercury has the same affects on the hormones and the nervous system that it does on birds. 

Im curious everyones opinion on this especially those with a background in biology or science.

I struggle on a daily basis with many symptoms that can be attributed to mercury toxicity like anxiety, irritability, fatigue, hormone problems etc . There have been many links between autism and mercury, Im wondering if it plays a part in me being gay as well."
Occasional rant,Ok-Escape-2543,ainbow,"Here goes another long rant

I cut people off because all i think about is what theyd think about me if they knew i was gay and it makes me shun people away.

Many people that i have ghosted or just turned away because i know wed be close but they wont be able to accept the fact that i am gay. 

And no just ""not caring what theyd think"" wont work because i am in the closed in a homophobic arab country, i cant just be out and then befriend people who would accept me.

Sometimes i feel i need These people in my life just live casually but i just cant live with this piece of information.

Sometimes i think i should just do it but i stop because i am gonna leave the country in a couple of years.

So many contradictions come with being gay its not just about accepting self its about accepting other people and living with it, which for me is much harder than dealing with my sexuality.

Currently i feel like a straying further from a group of friends, i feel bad but i cant explain why.

Always been introverted because i dont build relationships people because of what i assume they would think of me if they knew i was gay.

I thought i had somesort of anxiety but i just hate them for what they would think of me and avoid every human ever.

Little bits that are poorly organised but i just want to rant , just writing this and deleting it would have been enough for me but i am just gonna post because you would be people that wont think of me as others would."

He has also practiced hugging on me and sqeezed extra hard the last one. He has also pushed me down on the floor and told me to kneel for him. Also, the most recent thing was when I took his bag for fun and he came after. He grabbed my shoulders and told me to give it back and when I didnt he wrapped his arm around my throath like choking, but not literally. Then he started to roughen up my hair like 3 or 4 times and I asked him why he did that, and he said because he wanted to and bc it was fun so I did the same to him once. He knows Im gay too.

HIV paranoia? Desperately need calming down.,FunkyFlashBang,ainbow,"Hello everyone and thanks for reading this. I'm not normally one to worry and overthink, but I think this time it warrants a bit of concern. 

I'm a Male (30). On the 2nd January I had a sexual interaction with a trans person (male to female). During this time, I gave unprotected oral sex, before I received anal sex while they were using a condom. 

After the intercourse, I found out they are a sex worker. They are an escort and typically charge people for such sessions (I did not).

Anyway, fast forward one week later and I developed a mouth ulcer for the first time in my life, a pretty nasty one too. At the same time I felt lethargic and fatigue, which is unlike me. 

This ulcer cleared up in a week, and I have just discovered a second one today along with a very sore throat. Now I am seriously starting to worry about a possible HIV infection due to these symptoms matching up almost perfectly. 

Wtf do I do? 

Am I safe even though we used a condom? Or should I be worried about it passing through oral (which I heard the odds are almost zero).

Lastly, is this more likely a contracion of HPV or Herpes? After the session, I noticed they had a large wart on the base of their penis, which I missed when it was dark, which makes me think it could be something like that. 

Looking forward to your comments. Thank you."
Crush on a guy who might be ace?,MegaArmo,ainbow,"Heyo, as the title suggests I've been slowly falling in love with this friend of mine. At first I (22) assumed he (20) was straight, but he's never expressed or shown any interest in girls. He also started acting in a way that made me think he liked me, (looks, jokes, light flirting etc.), so I thought there was a chance he was closeted and I wanted to at least ask. 

I was processing this and trying to come up with a way of broaching the topic when I spoke to a mutual friend of ours. She said he had mentioned, after getting homophobic abuse on the bus from some drunk idiots, something which suggested he was ace. (Idk the exact words, and he didn't say it explicitly, just something like he wasn't 'into anybody like that...')

Now my dilemma is what to do with this, I really like him and want to see where I might stand. But I don't want to reveal that I know what he told my other friend, and I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable if he is ace and closeted about it.

Hope someone with experience, or someone who is asexual and might have some insight could give me some advice on what to do?

Thanks."

Impressions from a small town trans/queer demo.,pendasfemme,ainbow,"Today I attended a modest trans/queer demo in a pretty isolated part of the UK.

I loved every minute of it and everybody I spoke to was fantastic. It's not often you can get any conversation on such a level here, but today so many queer people stepped out and found each other, some who had done some considerable travelling to be there.

At risk of the wrong sort of people prying on this post, I think it's worth setting out my own impressions for my own memory, as a snapshot of a place in time, and as a letter to the wider world to show how small-town UK is doing at in early 2022:

\- You are no less likely to grow up a little different in a deprived village than you are in the centre of London. OK, I didn't learn this today, but some people need to get it into their heads!

\- More young people seem out than ever, at least to the more supportive people in their lives. Out of these people, they are very likely to have others at their place of education who are also out. As ever, there is some safety in numbers.

\- For a while now I've been extremely impressed by the numbers and freedom of expression from those a little younger than me. What I didn't quite grasp however was how everyone I spoke to. Verbal abuse seems to be a given in corridors and on the street. Physical attacks are spoken of as a common occurrence. Suicide came up unprompted.

\- For every out and proud young person you see online, there's another one completely cocooned offline for their own safety. Sometimes this is the exact same person.

\- A good example is signalling via dress. Kids will dress how they feel when they get to visit the city, and have a ""plain clothes"" look at home. Style rarely more out-there than what punks were wearing 45 years ago! Yet they still get into trouble expressing themselves locally.

\- The picture's a lot more detailed than when I grew up. Out of our small sample size, I spoke to someone of practically every initial on the rainbow spectrum. I think I was in my 20s when I first heard of the concept of nonbinary, but awareness really has improved. And everyone stands together. There are no conflicts of interest between groups no matter who wants to push them.

\- A minority within the older generations attempts to drive at these wedges. With bits of the demo posted online, the local MP attacked us baselessly, followed by a film producer who spent their Saturday night attacking activists aged 20 maximum. This sent a bat signal over to that very British phenomenon: the astroturfed, so-called ""GC"" movement. They have also spent their Saturday nights sending unsavory messages over. I've deliberately tried inuring myself to these people over time, but it's honestly quite upsetting how vicious they are. We need queer elders more than ever to counterbalance this weight.

\- These struggles are not at odds with putting food on the table, getting money in your pocket, whatever. In fact they often go hand in hand. ""LGB"" people are not in conflict with the ""T"". Again, I knew this already, but it just needs stating!

\- Nobody could name a local support group, outside a larger town/city an hour+ away. And even then... Obviously there's a lot of desire among everyone there to move away when they come of age and that won't change much no matter whatcities do it better for finding your peoplebut outside the most informal arrangements, it's a lonely upbringing here.

\- The nearest gender identity clinics etc are located three hours away. If you can't go private, you'll be waiting 2+ years.

\- Those with a duty of care are failing. MPs are being abusive, councillors aren't listening, police don't pick up cases. Teachers treat the hate simply as if the assailant is being ""mean"", if they even treat it at all. Some reported homophobic teachers and an inability to confide in anyone because word eventually reaches the homophobes who then make your life hard. One person's account I heard honestly sounded like it came from the Section 28 era, where school staff were forbidden from mentioning anything LGBT+ and had to remove any LGBT+ literature from school premises: you're out on your own.

\- People are largely decent. We've received all this hatred online, but stood in a busy thoroughfare for over two hours and didn't receive any hostility as a group of mostly young, out and proud folks. The local MP did sent out a lackey to take a few creepshots of the teenagers though.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, well done if you got to the end of that. I hope it's informative. And as much as I hope it makes us realise that we must fight for everything and take nothing for granted, I also hope it provides everyone with a little to be positive about too."

"Is it hate-speech to use the term 'chhakka' on a live webinar? I think so. What can be done? I ask you, especially the people from India.",Karenrecycler,ainbow,"To clarify, the term ""chhakka"" is an extremely derogatory term used for trans people in India, i.e. think the F word for gays and N word for black people (love and respect for both).

So there is this faculty who used the word 'chhakka' for an Indian artist (cis-male) as a derogatory term on an ongoing live lecture in front of 200-300 young impressionable students. I am not sure what sort of desperate validation seeking attempt this was but this faculty is an uncultured swine for sure. On top of that, the organization he works at doesn't have many morals to begin with, filth begets filth, so he went scott free after a half assed blame directing apology. ""If you are offended by what I said...."" Other than some sexist remarks, homophobia and transphobia, it's astounding to see nothing happening to such people after such derogatory dehumanising remarks in front of so many people. He didn't feel accountable for anything, neither was he held so. The faculty is also a student at an institute of India, fyi. I just want to know if anything will come off it if this was to reach a strong group of individuals, human rights activists from India, social media, the police, the institute and the HR of any company he may work at in the future. What can be done?

DM for further discussions in case the sub doesn't allow it. Trans hate needs to stop. People need to be aware. People need to be held accountable. Imagine to have paid to learn from this organisation for better career prospects and to have someone like this make such offensive remarks. The toll on someone's mind who works hard to make it in this country only to come across things like thess that pound your mental well-being into dust."
Parents said some stuff and now I feel awful.,_AnonymousMoose_,ainbow,"I (15 trans lesbian) went to therapy today but this time my parents came too, we discussed a number of things, but what my parents said made me feel really terrible.

How do you start to accept yourself?,AckchyuallySir,ainbow,"I acknowledged that I am bi/finsexual a few months ago, but I haven't really come any closer to being honest to myself. To tell you the truth, it has probably just resulted in more uncertainty for me.

I haven't come out to anyone in my personal life, partly because I don't like being the center of attention, but mostly because I know everyone in my life excluding my mom will treat me differently or completely cut me off if I told them. I don't have any LGBT friends to talk to about it, and although I'm aware that people in the community are not monolithic, the interactions I have had with people in it have led me to believe that I wouldn't have much in common with them. 

This is especially confusing because I'm generally a person that doesn't care about what people think of me, but this particular circumstance is very difficult to navigate. I was raised in a homophobic environment, so I have internalised a lot of damaging things. Although I want to, I'm not comfortable acting on my desires because I still think of it as something shameful. The thought of being with someone and having them tell people scares the hell out of me. While I'm attracted to trans women and feminine men, I'm still only interested in having relationships with cis women, and knowing the stigma that bisexual men have and some women's reluctance to be with one, it just makes me think I should ignore my desires completely. I just don't know if that's something I would regret or not.

How do you become comfortable and confident enough to do whatever you want to do, regardless of how other people might react? I thought I already had those qualities, but this has shown me that I'm not quite there yet."

The eternal question: to go or not go for it when in love with a good friend,Queenofmyownfantasy,ainbow,"Hello,

I am 20yo and from a mostly progressive country. Have never had a relationship and am currently in college finishing a bachelors degree

There's a girl in my class who I've felt vaguely attracted to ever since I saw her for the first time. Simply her whole...vibe, kinda. More on the quiet and "" intellectual "" side, with a tad of artsy. But I was shy at first so nothing happened. 

Well, covid happened so we had little chance to get to know each other through the rest of our schooltime, but in the bits and pieces of time together it occured to me I really really like her, and that we have a lot in common. Similar taste in superficial things such as clothes and food, but also a similar outlook on life, we simply want the same things in life and have similar principles. Sometime last year I realized I am really in love with her. But know...Does she feel the same for me, is the question. I once semi-jokingly asked her if she's gay and she said she wasn't sure, doesn't feel comfortable labelling herself etc, so that's one thing. Yet at the same time she's very caring and kind to me despite my constant insecurity and making things awkward. She's incredibly patient. She also 100% knows I am very gay and doesn't mind at all, even laughing at memes and jokes about being gay/lesbian/sapphic. Things tend to be quiet when we message (which is most of the time due to less rl classes due to covid) but she explained that as being uncomfortable texting, when we see each other in rl things are simply very peaceful. We look at each other, and I don't look many people in the eye, we laugh at each other jokes, we don't mind each other's quirks. Everything just feels so peaceful and organic and I want to be with her all the time and hug and kiss her, but despite all the 'good signs' I am still unsure. I am not only in love with her, we're also good friends, and I am afraid she will not feel the same and back out when I confess my love to her after knowing each other for 2,5 years of being and acting like friends, and I will loose a good friend."

Please help lgbt refugees in Kenya,Kakuma_queer,ainbow,"I am gay from Kakuma refugee camp, I am Ugandan but run from Uganda because of persecution and all that happened on the 27th of January 2020. I am worried for my life due to another terrible attacks from fellow refugees that are not gay and Kenyan citizens. I have wanted several times to escape from the camp because of the living conditions and severe attacks on our community that have led to 4 of our fellow lgbt to death. I was born on 28th, August 1998. I need help from who ever can help me. 

My boyfriend is ""I loved him so much"" who am not sure if he is still alive in Uganda. On the day when they got us having sex, 27th Jan 2020. We were beaten thoroughly, the community wanted to set us on arson because they take us to be useless and community curses. There was a lot of people beating us, when the police came and people dispersed I was able to run away, run directly to the border of Kenya where I got an idea of going to red cross in Kenya. The red cross handed me over to UNHCR that then brought me to Kakuma refugee camp. On reaching in the camp I was given a shelter made of tents, but this applied to other lgbt I found in the camp. Other refugees that are not lgbt started attacking us and it's where we got an idea of gathering together. We have heard several attacks that led our friend to death.

https://www.ebar.com/news/latest_news//308701
There is the link showing one of our friends who died in the arson that was set on our shelters by homophobes. 

We have tried to go to UNHCR compound several times but we have not got the answer from UNHCR. I am a leader and an activist as well. 

I am looking forward to spreading more information so that it reaches the right organisation that help lgbt refugees in Kenya.

"I don't know if my ""friend"" is just really obnoxious or actually likes me. I don't know what to do.",Ms_Digglesworth,ainbow,"Okay so, I (24 F) have a friend (23F) that I made in high school that I am trying to let go of. This isn't the focus of the post so I will sum it up by saying she is extremely high maintainence, treats me like a therapist to rant about her problems with men and a personal driver to ask to take her to dates with guys,  never listens to any advice that I give her that she asks for, and if I don't respond to a message from her within like an hour, she spams me on other platforms. Overall our friendship has just stopped feeling like a friendship to me and feels parasitic. 

I am not good at confrontation so I have been trying to just let the friendship fizzle out by making plans far less frequently  (last times we saw each other were in July and then October) and lately honestly I have just not been opening or responding to any messages she sends me (since late November). 

So lately I downloaded and installed a bisexual/lesbian dating app, and today she liked me on it She had mentioned to me once in the past that she might be bi, but it was only in passing and so I was surprised that she was on there to begin with. I'm not sure whether to interpret it as 
1) She is just trying to contact me, happened to see me on the app, and decided to try on there
Or
2) She actually is interested in me. 
Either way, I'm made really uncomfortable by this. If 1 is true, she is just being really really stubborn, won't take a hint, and just won't let this friendship die. And is using this app for the wrong purposes. 
And if 2 is true, well for starters I am obviously not interested in her. But more importantly, telling someone you formally know that you like them by liking them on a dating app seems, inappropriate I think is the word. And I know what you might think, well how is she supposed to tell me if haven't been opening or responding to messages on other accounts? Well in that case i would think that if someone hasn't been getting back to you, then it might not be a good time to tell them that  you like them. 

I know I am not completely a saint in this situation and I should have ended the friendship bluntly and prevented this from ever happening, but well, now I'm here. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?"
what should I do about my possibly transphobic brother?,dropbearfred,ainbow,"I've noticed over the years that my younger brother seems to be almost radicalizing to be really transphobic through tiktok and YouTube. I'm not sure how to handle the situation, if I should do anything at all. Just looking through some tiktoks with him I've noticed that a worryingly large amount of his recommended tiktoks are transphobic jokes or rants. What's very conflicting for me is that my brother is quite a compassionate person, who knows about my bisexuality and supports me wholeheartedly. We even make inside jokes about it in front of my parents who don't know. I know that my brother is really just uneducated on the topic of transpeople and is still navigating his way through the world, I just hope that I could be able to help him as well before he falls to deep down the transphobic rabbit hole. Sorry for the rant."

I Need Some Help w/Gender!,throwaway_acct8092,ainbow,"Hello, lovely people of Reddit!

I need some help figuring out my gender. For some background information, Im AMAB and about 16 years old.

Ive been questioning my gender for almost three years, ever since Ive found out NB people exist. Lets be honest though, it has only been on and off. However, Ive been really thinking about it this past year.

No matter my gender, I like being GNC and androgynous.

Im thinking that Im genderfluid. My perception of my gender changes over time. At first, I thought that I was agender. I then thought I was a demiboy. Then, I thought that I was agenderflux (this label may still apply, IDK). After that, I thought I was a cis guy for two weeks. Now, I think that Im genderfluid. However, it is a large possibility that I have gender dysphoria. . Im going to be discussing that with my therapist soon.

Sometimes, I would rather be perceived as female over male. It can be the opposite of that too. Sometimes, I just dont want to be perceived as anything. 

When it comes to pronouns, it doesnt really matter. However, I do prefer they/them pronouns over everything else.

I thought that I was pansexual for a couple of years, but I just learned that I wanted to look like the women and NB people that I liked. Im just gay now. For some reason, when Im imagining myself in a relationship, I want to be a guy. If that makes sense. It seems that outside sources might influence how I perceive gender. I see nonbinary and other trans binary people and I really identify with their experiences. I really feel like the TikTok below expresses how I feel. Please watch.

[https://www.tiktok.com/@emmie.teagan/video/7040134131732319494?is\_copy\_url=1&amp;is\_from\_webapp=v1](https://www.tiktok.com/@emmie.teagan/video/7040134131732319494?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1)

Like, do I just want to be nonbinary because I think it is cool. I see trans people and its like I want to be that so bad. Why am I like this? Am I just faking everything? Is it because of my severe internalized misandry (which plays a big role)?

I know that I need a gender specialist. Its just my parents arent all that supportive. Like, they think I dont have any issues. They will only accept me if I have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. I already told them again, after coming out twice, that Im cis. Thats just because I didnt want them getting any suspicions that I was out at school, and not home.

As far as issues with my body go, I dont have any problems with my primary sex characteristics. I just have problems with my secondary sex characteristics, such as my body hair.

I just have no idea what is going on with me. Things change often and it is causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. Its hard to focus on my work. 

What should I do? Does anyone else feel like this? What have you done to cope? Its all very overwhelming. 

If I could get anyones help and advice, please let me know. Thank you for your replies."
My son is showing signs that he could be transgender - I need help,mommaofgirlyson,ainbow," I am a single mother. My son is now 11. My son can be best described as a tom girl - he is a boy who likes girly stuff. For example, he likes dresses and skirts, likes getting his nails done, and has really long hair just like I do. He has been like this since he was 6-7.

I made a post about this on another sub, and many commenters seem to think that my son could in fact be a trans girl. And he has been showing signs of this. He did ask me a couple of times why he cant be a girl, and he has also asked me several times why people think of him as a boy and not a girl and why people use he/him pronouns for him.

Now, I want to make it very clear that I am fully supportive of his gender identity, regardless of what he chooses to identify as. In fact, I have always loved him as a daughter. That being said, I am unsure if I should start taking action immediately or wait for him to come out himself. A lot of commenters on the other post told me that its best to have him talk to a therapist and get him started on puberty blockers. However, I am not sure if he really wishes to identify as a girl and if he might regret the decision later on in his life.

What do you guys think? Do you think my son is just in a phase, or is he actually a girl? What do you think is the best course of action I should take? And do you know any other smaller subreddits that could be of help? Thanks."

(TW) queer or not,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey yall dad checking in on hoping youre all doing well. I love you and support you and wish some day I could meet you just to see how youre doing. 

One little note before I get into what I want to post about. For years I have said I was bi because I was once married to a woman m, but I have realized since then Im only attracted to men. So Im actually gay I think I was afraid to admit because of having been married but I realized I got married because at the time its what youre supposed to do. So Im actually gay dad now lol. 

I have been contemplating on being called queer. Now I know some find it offensive others dont. Personally when you look at the original definition it means; strange, peculiar, different,deviant, eccentric etc. 

Then they started applying it to the lgbtqia community. Now to the hetero world we probably are strange or peculiar etc. but in reality I dont believe we are. 

In order for us to be queer based on the original definition hetero would have to be proven to be normal and therefore us abnormal. When you see homosexuality in other animals and such I dont think you can definitively say heterosexual is the norm. 

Personally I dont find the term offensive, because in some ways I am queer. I think we all are. Not in our sexuality but in our other idiosyncrasies. How we dress how we accessorize etc. 

To me queer means being unique.  I thrive on being unique. We all should. We should find our own style and way of doing things. Remember people celebrate individuality never followers.

Thoughts on gender abolitionism? Do you think it's inherently anti-trans?,GiorgioOrwelli,ainbow,"My gut instinct tells me that gender abolitionism might be kinda anti-trans.

TERFs usually call themselves gender abolitionists, yet they ironically police gender expression as much as conservatives do. They want to immediately get rid of the gender binary, but that usually ends up with them shitting on most people since most people express some kind of gender along the traditional masculine-feminine binary. Basically TERFs demand that people stop identifying with femininity or masculinity and they want to force a genderless way of being onto everyone. This is why TERFs tend to be shitty to anyone they perceive as behaving/dressing/expressing themselves too stereotypically feminine or masculine. 

TERFs in recent years have tried to court NB people (and some TERFs are NBs, though most TERFs are cis women) but most NB are pretty anti-TERF in my experience. In my experience, most NBs and binary trans people get along just fine, and most NB people are fine with the masculine-feminine binary still existing. 

My personal opinion is that we should get rid of gender roles and expectations that traditionally have been associated with masculinity and femininity, but I don't think that means we should get rid of the concept of masculine genders or feminine genders."

So why do so many people think bi = orgies?",GiorgioOrwelli,ainbow,"I've known both het people and gay people who believe all bi people are super into orgies. But for some reason this stereotype doesn't really exist for gay men or lesbians, at least not to the same degree.

But many people when they think of bi people, they immediately think of bi orgies. Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with people? Where the heck did this stereotype come from?"
I Imagined Myself Hugging My BF Since He's TOO faaarrrrrr :'(,Accomplished_Ant8671,ainbow, 
My mom and I came out to each other and now I'm not sure what to feel,A_Cloud_Person,ainbow,"I've known I was asexual since I was 13 (I'm nearly 19). That's not to say I didn't struggle and doubt myself since then, but I pretty much always knew. I've wondered whether or not to come out to my parents for years since I was afriad they'd call it a ""phase"", ""trend"" or just treat me less than for it.

That brings me to a couple nights ago. My mother and I were alone in our family's lounge area after she had just finished a few glasses of wine. We got into the topic of my boyfriend dumping me a little under a year ago (he deemed us incompatible due to my asexuality - my mom did not know this) and asked me if it was because I wouldn't ""put out"" for him. I confirmed her theories, but when she asked me why I didn't just ""do it"", I couldn't hold it in anymore. It was like nearly 6 years of waiting for the right time was flooding out of me.

I told her I was asexual, and rambled on how it didn't change who I was, just how she saw me. That I knew for years, but was so afraid of how the news would be received that I held it down. I was crying by this time, and my mom was devastated for me. Even if she didn't fully understand what being asexual meant, she tried to show me support by hugging me and saying she was bi.

She drunkenly confessed that she had almost gotten into a relationship with a woman she had been ""friends with"" from my childhood. But that in the end she had chosen my dad over this woman.

I know that he knows about it based on other things throughout my life, so at the very least they've gotten over it together. I'm glad she shared with me her truth, but now I'm feeling kind of hollow and unsure of how to feel. To know that my mom might have cheated (at least emotionally) on my dad is a hard pill to swallow.

I doubt many people have had a similar experience to me, but any advice would be welcome."

I wish i was straight but not because i hate being gay,Ok-Escape-2543,ainbow,"

I have dated girls when i was experimenting with my sexuality and it was so easy to find someone and click with, but it was so easy to find someone interested in me and it was easy for me to get a girl that i was interested in, we just talk have fun and the spark is there its so ridiculously easy, i am not even that attractive but have had many chances with girls, heteroes lives are just paved (i know i sound like an ass saying this but i am just so triggered)

meanwhile me being gay, i dont even have a chance to publicly look for someone because my country is homophobic, if someone throws hints for being gay they end up getting scared because they risk being alienated from society if they were outed,

when i started surfing the internet to try to be somewhat in contact with the gay community i just got bombarded by ""top bottom"" ""sub dom"" ""masc fem"" stuff that i havent even ever thought about, whats even crazier is that now that is so embedded in everything, what happened to just being with someone you like without having to go through a foot long check list Thats supposed to be the ""compatibility scale"" before you even talk to the person or know if you like their character in the first place.

Everyone is so horny and this whole thing us built around hook ups that a guy has to spend half his life in the gym to be valid tbh i doubt that the majority go to the gym for health its just a vicious cycle of ""go to gym have a hoot body hook up"" rinse and repeat.

Please correct me if i am wrong but this is what i saw when i a checked every place of the gay community online as i have no other contact to other gays anywhere else."
Homophobic Parents Broke Us Up - Feeling Hopeless,Dry_Thing_9210,ainbow,"For context: We are both 15 year old cis bisexual females in a catholic highschool. We dated for almost a year. This is both our first serious relationship. Her parents are homophobic while her sister is supportive of us. My family is pretty supportive. 

Before New Years, me and my girlfriend were on Facetime when her mom called her out her room. A few minutes went by and then her mom walked in and ended the call. After this happened, whenever I texted her she seemed really weird.

I later found out a day later that my now ex girlfriends parents forced her to break up with me because they went through her phone without her knowledge when she was asleep and found our conversations. (Im not sure why they went through her phone, from what I know they seem pretty invasive)

Her parents screamed and shouted at her saying that theyre disappointed in her for dating a girl, and said that they didnt have a daughter just for her to date someone elses.

She told me that if they caught her dating a girl ever again, theyd punish her like making her change schools, taking away her phone, and letting her only go out with approved friends. 

Essentially, her parents basically forced her to become straight which is sickening. 

We can only be friends because of her parents. We both agreed to wait for each other once she moves out and be friends for now. Then we agreed to take some time off from talking to each other to process the situation.  

However, while breaking up, she told me that her anniversary gift that she ordered a few weeks back came in. 

I already gave her an anniversary gift before leaving for Christmas break, because I had a feeling COVID was going to get worse and we wouldnt be able to see each other. 

I rejected it, because I didnt want something that can remind me that I cant be with her due to her homophobic parents. Which seemed to make her a little bit upset. 

Recently, she checked up on me asking how I was. I asked her if she still had feelings for me and she said not really. I got really scared because I thought we were going to wait for her to move out. 

During her checkup, she expressed that she felt really hurt when I rejected her gift and that she needs more time even when I explained to her why I didnt want it. 

She said that she didnt do anything to my gift and that if she were in my shoes, she would accept the gift no matter what.

Now, we are giving each other some more time and we arent talking to each other for now and I really miss her. I feel like a dumbass for not accepting the gift, but at the same time I know that would just hurt even more. 

I wish this didnt happen. I dont know how people can be so cruel to others just because they love the same gender. 

Im not sure what exactly to do. I want her to be happy even if Im not with her. 

I also want to be with her forever, whether that being her friend or partner, but I dont want her to be mistreated by her family. 

Since this is a pretty difficult situation, Im not sure if its best to just give up hopes of ever being with her again or wait for her once were adults. 

Any advice would be extremely appreciated. 

TL;DR: Girlfriends homophobic parents went through her phone without her knowing and forced her to become straight and break up with me."

Manly  wtf,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey gang Dad checking in on everyone hoping youre having a great weekend. Remember how loved and special you are and know that I support you in everything you do.

So I was thinking about gender yesterday while I was getting my haircut. What brought it up was after the lady finish shaving my head she put some type of conditioner on it and made the comment oh thats a nice manly smell. Why can just simply be a nice fragrance why does it have to be manly why does it have to be feminine. 

Why is society so hung up on gender norms and gender rising everybody?  I know people guys who would love to wear dresses and skirts not because theyre transgender but just because they like them and they feel more comfortable. However they dont because society tends to make fun of them when they do that same for women who want to dress as tomboys theyre automatically labeled as lesbian or trying to dress as a man. Why does it matter why cant it simply be about comfort and style. 

Why cant it be about expressing ones own individuality?  I know there are places in the world where its more acceptable to do those things than it is in others but for the most part dressing as the opposite gender or gender neutral tends to get people bullied and harassed. 

I wish society all over the world would come to realize in some cases its just an expression of individuality and comfort. I wish we would find a way when it comes to clothing for instance to come up with one standard size for everything so that it would fit male or female know I know theyre those out there they say oh well females have a different body type then males etc. but for the most part it can be made to work. 

Parents same goes for your children if your sons want to wear skirts or dresses let them if your girls want to dress more manly let them.  Let them be who they are they may simply be a boy who likes to wear girl clothes or a girl who likes to wear boy clothes it doesnt matter support your kids. My dms are open if you need to talk.

I have followers on Twitter who support me, and I'm very glad that they support who I really am! But I really wanna open up to my offline friends and I'm wondering what is the best way to explain being Xenogender.

I identify as a couple different Xenogenders which fluctuate over time! This means that on certain days I may feel like one or the other, or even a mixture of them! I'll list some of the Xenogenders that I'm vibing with along with their descriptions from the lgbta wikia if that helps!

Cheesegender - Cheesegender is a xenogender related to cheese. One may feel that their gender feels like cheese, tastes like it, or may just want to incorporate cheese into their gender. It could also be an aesthetigender, relating to the aesthetic of cheese. Cheesegender can be considered a gastrogender, but it doesn't have to. Cheesegender is not exclusive and can be used by neurodivergent and neurotypical people. Cheesegender can be felt along with other genders, binary or not (ex. cheesegirl, cheeseboy, cheesenonbinary...)

Vampiregender is typically referred to as an Aesthetigender, specifically a mythologender (relating to mythological creatures in terms of gender), a subset of religigender (relating to religion in terms of gender), and can also be referred to as a noungender or even a neurogender. It can also be deemed a category of gender, as many subsets of it have been created to suit specific binary genders/different perceptions of a ""vampiric"" gender. It may also be a kingender, although this is not always the case.

Godgender, otherwise known as Deusgender, is a xenogender in which someone strongly identifies themselves with the concept of a deity or acknowledges a divine aspect within themselves. They can also incorporate the concept of deities to better understand their identity. Godgender can also be a kingender, but it is not solely a kingender. Historically, there have been masculine deities, feminine deities, androgynous deities, non-binary deities, etc.

Catgender is a xenogender in which one feels an extremely strong connection to cats or other felines, either strongly identifying with them or simply wanting to incorporate them into their gender to better understand their identity. It was made with neurodivergent individuals in mind, specifically autistic individuals, as well as individuals who may experience delusions relating to being a cat or other feline, or individuals who experience species-regression. However, anyone may identify as catgender.[1]

One who identifies as catgender may refer to themself as a ""catboy,"" ""catgirl,"" ""nyan-binary,"" or simply catgender or another combination, depending on their gender identity.

Pichugender is a Xenogender defined as ""a small gender that feels fuzzy with a small electric charge"" Or alternatively, a gender related to the Pokemon Pichu.

Emojigender is a xenogender that is related in some way to emoji(s). This may be described as a connection to emojis in general, a connection to multiple specific emojis, or a connection to one specific emoji.

Deergender is a xenogender in which someone feels an extremely strong connection to adult deer or other adult cervids. One may either strongly identify with them or simply want to incorporate them into their gender to better understand their identity. It was made with neurodivergent individuals in mind, specifically autistic individuals, as well as people who may experience delusions relating to being an adult deer or other adult cervid. However, anyone may identify as deergender."
Parents who get it,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family its dear old dad checking up on you. I hope everyone is doing great and having a good start to the year. Remember always I love you and support you no matter what you cannot change that. 

I really love telling inspiring stories about people who do the right thing especially when it comes to their children. Celebrities are always shown being accepting and things like that but I enjoy putting the spot light on everyday people when I see it. 

I am in Atlanta this week because as much as I hate my parents my dads in the hospital with kidney failure and my moms blind and needs someone to drive her. So I drop her off so she can visit and pick her up when its time to go home. 

While shes visiting Ive been hitting all the malls and stores in Atlanta.  Yesterday I was in the mall in one of the big department stores just killing time. This family came walking in about the same time I did. It was mom dad and 2 kids a boy age 10 ish and a girl about 12 Id guess. As they were entering the mom said are we looking in the boys department or girls first. The son said I wish I could wear girl clothes. Mom and dad both said you can if youd be more comfortable. The smile on that boys face was priceless. 

I turned around and talked to the parents telling them how heart warming it was to see accepting parents. We talked just briefly and they went on their way. I was going through the girls section later heading to another part of the store when I heard a squeal of joy and laughter. I looked and the boy came out in an outfit he had tried on and was in love with it. Dont know if it was his first that he tried on or not but he was happy. 

As parents are job is not only to raise our children but to listen to them. They want to tell us how they feel but if we make ourselves unapproachable they will never talk to us. 

There is nothing unnatural or wrong or sinful about a person child or adult being lgbtqia+ so support your kids individuality and let them love who they love. 

Love dad"
I wrote a musical and I need feedback!,Tall_arkie_9119,ainbow,"Hey Reddit, during lockdown 2020 I went on a writing binge and wrote a musical in the style of old Broadway and Hollywood musicals. I've never written anything like it before so I was wondering if any theater bros/gals/peoples can read it and help me get it somewhere. Idk if I could stage it it would be the dream of a lifetime but I'll settle for any writing feedback.

I had my first kiss!!!,Inner_Mistake,ainbow,"It actually happened one day before the new years and I was so not expecting it to happen like that :]]

So, we went to the local gay spot of our city with my sis cuz one of my queer friends asked if we wanted to join them but when we got there it was cold af so we decided to all go back to my sisters and my place to have a little early new years celebration.  (Our parents dont live at our city apartment)

The point being that everyone got so fuckin wasted and just started making out with eachother all of a sudden. I was just kinda chilling there until I started chatting with this one girl and a guy and we bonded over hentai.. (Dont even ask) at one point the guy went to the kitchen and me being drunk af decided to just casually mention how I was feeling like making out with someone really bad. 

So.. that girl literally just leaned towards me and we make out twice :]

I kinda sucked at it but she didnt seem to mind at all so that was really great&lt;33

To this moment I cant believe it happened. It just makes me feel so fuzzy inside jsjsnwneje"
My new year's resolution,Reallycre8tivename,ainbow,"Hi people. Ik most of you guys probably don't know me and probably won't have an interest in this post but I just wanted to share my plans somewhere just so they feel a bit more concrete to me.

So I've been mostly out as genderfluid for a while now (since around August 2020) and as part of my new year's resolution I'm preparing to make a couple big steps at some point this year.

My first one is in work. Previously I've always kept my fluidity of of job applications as I've been too scared however last year in December I decided to put it in and I might be going to the interview in my feminine form (though idk cos it depends on what gender I feel on the day). I'm going to continue this in any other job applications I do. I'm not going to hide it from potential employers anymore.

Secondly I'm hoping to come out fully. I'm already out to most of my close friends or relatives but there's still a few that I've not told. Hopefully this year I can do it. I've began to put plans in place in case it all goes wrong but that's merely as a safety back up rather than something I actually expect to happen. 

Being in the closet even though it's just partially has been bugging me for a while now and I think this year I'm finally at the stage where coming out fully won't cause any problems or risk to me anymore :)"

Even in the closet youre valid,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey dad here hoping everyone is doing well. I cant tell you how much I love you and enjoy helping you out. You all are so very special and I support you in all you do. 

Have you ever questioned whether or not youre valid. Not just in every day life, but within the lgbtqia community. I have. When I was younger and living on the streets I often questioned if I was valid being bi. Hell I often questioned if I was valid period cause what 14 year old should be living on the street. I often thought of lying to my parents and saying I was wrong just to get back home, but I knew I wasnt wrong and in my mind I would be invalidating myself. 

I dont want you to feel like that. I want you to know youre valid even if youre still in the closet. You dont have to be out and put yourself in danger just because you think youre not valid unless you do. The minute you realize who you are youre valid, coming out is just telling those around you what you always knew. 

This applies to all areas of lgbtqia even my trans family who struggle feeling like they dont pass. Remember the outside appearance is not who you really are. Inside you are that girl or that boy or enby etc. just because you dont see it yet doesnt make you invalid its there inside that lump of coal on the outside. The pressure is still working to produce the diamond inside. 

Never feel again that you are invalid. You are as valid as any heterosexual person out there. My dms are open to anyone who needs to talk. 

Love dad"

HELP,Select_Impression571,ainbow,"ok so when i was younger, my friend and i showed each other our dicks. from that point on i knew he was gay. anyways fast forward to us being teenagers, and i was at the gym alone one night, and i mad e afake snapchat and added him and asked to see his ass. He sent it. I was blown away. As soon as i saw it i pulled my pants down and showed my dick. We sent back and forth and i busted like i never have before. everytime i did it tho, i deleted the account and and just made a new one eveery time i wanted to. It went on for years, then he asked who i was for real and i always got nervous that he would either stop sending if he knew or tell everyone i was gay. i would freak and block him. yadda yadda yadda, he found out it was me and was ok. but i was playing too many games and i got a gf. once he knew that he wanted to stop. im obsessed and still try to talk sometime but we never do. i get grindr and sometimes i find him, but once he sees my dick he leaves. i cant find anyone as good. he was a twink and i wanna fuck a twink so bad. how do i get one"

Do I have the right to be pissed when people are dramatic about apologising for misgendering me?,Uncomfortable_enby,ainbow,"Ive been out for almost 3 years now, 1 of them as transman, the other 2 as non binary. Things went pretty smoothly when people went from she/her to he/him, but when I asked for them to call me they/them, it all went down the drain. People went back to calling me she/her (for some odd reason). Its been about 1.5 years now, and theyre still so bad at it.

Now onto the actual problem. Ive stopped correcting them, because every time I do, I get a 15 minute explanation about how hard it is for them, and how confusing it is, and how I need to relax about it, and blah blah blah. Every. Single. Time. I feel like by now, theyre just filling me with bullsh!t to avoid bettering themselves.

When I spoke to my mother about it, she got pissed. She told me that I should be grateful theyre trying, and that she does understand why I find it annoying, but I should just tell them and deal with it.

Im lost. It messes me up to the point where Ive considered detransitioning, or just going back to being transman, because apparently its easier that way."

How long is too long for friends/close family to not be using your correct name and pronouns?,Its_Sasha,ainbow,"Hey folks. I just want to gauge what others think. I've been out among friends and family for about 20 months now, and my parents and siblings still very often (60% of the time) call me by my deadname and misgender me. It hurts every time they do it and when I ask them to use my correct name and pronouns, they tell me that it's hard to switch over and that I need to be accomodating for their difficulty in changing. My mother told me that it will be easier for her to do when I start passing.

New year better you,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey dad here doing a final check in this year. I hope you all had a good year. I love each and every one of you you all hold a special place in my heart. 

As we end this year a begin a new one tomorrow its common here in America to make resolutions. Some people resolve to lose weight or eat healthier. Some try to save more money or things like that. 

Even us in the lgbtqia+ community make resolutions. For some its to come out of the closet (btw I hate that term) for others its to find their true self and so on. Mine is to resolve to always be there if you guys need me. 

This year if your resolution involves coming or being more of your true self go for it. Dont hold back reach for the dream. Family will try to stop you under the pretense that they dont want you to be hurt truth is their afraid of how they will be seen. People will try to tell how to dress and act but dont let society stop you from self expression. 

This year be the you that youve always seen yourself as. As a community we need to resolve to keep fighting for equality. We need to step up and fight harder and make people hear us when talk about injustice. This year needs to be better for all of us. My dms are open if you need to talk. 

Happy new year

Where do you go when youve tried everything?,Investing_Walrus,ainbow,"I know there are hordes of posts like this already out there. And I know that plenty of people will comment  something along the lines of itll work out eventually. But its starting to feel like theres a good chance it really wont, ever.

Its so, incredibly hard to just to meet other gay people my age, both back home in my super conservative hometown, and at my college in a fairly dense left-leaning inner city. I can count the number of gay people Ive met on one hand, and the number that have ever been interested in me on one finger.

Im going on 22, and Ive never been with anyone. Ive never been on a date, never been kissed, etc. And thats perfectly okay in principle. If youre 22, and you havent done these things, and youre just not ready or havent taken the time to seek them out, thats fine. But it doesnt feel okay to have actively sought these things and have never come even close to meeting someone.  
Ive tried all the dating apps. I recently deleted Grindr because it was a huge drain on my mental health. I talk to people, sometimes have great conversations over hours or days, and get blocked as soon as they see my face. Every time, across hundreds or thousands of people and, at this point, years of trying. 

Im not out. Definitely not to my ultra-conservative, fundamentalist Christian family. Not at school, either. But a couple close friends know, and Ive put myself out there amongst gay acquaintances (of which there have been very few) and friend groups, and clubs and activities on campus. 

I want a relationship. Im the sort of person that craves close physical and emotional intimacy, and I cant have that. 

I dont know what else to do. I dont know anyone my age that hasnt had these experiences. I dont know whats wrong with me. I dont consider myself attractive, but I never thought I was so unattractive Im not good enough for a partner. 

At this point Im seriously considering just getting wasted and hooking up with some 40 or 50 year old guy on Grindr. Anything just to hold someone and be held. Its the only thing I can find, and maybe the only thing Im good enough for.

I want someone that understands my experience, who I can talk to about the things I have no one else to, and who I can hold when Im feeling down about all the people in my life and in the world who hate me for something I cant change but gladly would if given the chance.

"I need advice, am I bi and on the ace spectrum?",RowanRedwing,ainbow,"Hello! I currently identify as bisexual, but I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm on the ace spectrum as well? I'm really confused, I know I'm still bi, but I started questioning if I may be a gray bisexual if there's such a thing?I'm confident enough to say that I've been attracted to one person in my life, and maybe i could've eventually been attracted to another if I had gotten to know them better. (I'm not demi though)  Other than that, there's a handful of people online that I can say I mightve been attracted to,, but were easily forgotten about in maybe a day,, a week tops. I've recently come to realize that other than the two instances stated above, some of the few ""crushes"" I thought I had, weren't crushes, and were mostly aesthetic attraction.I'm not sure if I'm questioning just because a lot or bisexuals, and the general population, tend to oversexualize bisexuality, so maybe I am just bisexual, and I'm just overthinking bi culture. I *want* to like someone, but it's been years since the last time I was able to. Not long ago, I thought I liked a boy and I was very excited, though I knew I wouldn't pursue him because I didn't think I had a chance, but he cut his hair, and I lost interest. I told this to an ace friend, and they told me this was just aesthetic attraction. I was disappointed. Im just not sure how how frequent crushes should be. Whats the average amount of crushes for most people? 
I'm still in highschool; and the longest crush I have had was probably around 3 or 4 months long, it's been a good 3 and a half years since that happened. It still feels like my friends have had more crushes or interests than me. Which is saying a lot considering my friends consist of an ace person, and someone who swore of romance for years. I don't remember ever being interested in anyone as a kid, while a lot of my friends do. Other than that I've only really felt fleeting interest in a handful of people, tbh this ""interest"" is probably just sometype of platonic attraction, or just me trying to find someone to like, because I do want to like someone, it just seems like it never happens. 
I know I'm bi to some extent because the people I have liked/had vague interest in has been both male and female. 
Again, maybe it's normal to have only had one major crush in my whole life.. if there's anyone has some words of wisdom, could you please tell me your experiences and how you found out you were ace? It'd really help a lot :)"

Is it my fault or just unlucky?,Zynder7,ainbow,"Hello fellow people,

Im currently taking my bachelors degree and Ive been in an awful position (pun) since the day I identified myself as a gay man. Im not out to my family, only to a few close friends (probs less than 10 ish?) that Im really comfortable with. I made a few gay friends along the way. I find it troubling as Im unfortunately still single after years of searching for someone, and really not in the luck with guys. 

Every time I chat with someone on apps about life decisions, hobbies and plans, it somehow always ended up with sexting or me receiving weird sex bunny stickers. Guess what my profile description is? Not looking for big pepe to munch on omnomnom slurp slurp but just Weeeee. 

Also there was this dude that stopped talking to me after we went out once. I was kinda amazed Cus all he talked to me during the outing was how his friends would react when they know Im his boy friend. But like bruh we arent even dating. And after about 2-3 months ish, he texted me and asked me if we were still dating. I was like wow I thought it didnt happen at all because you didnt even approach me after the date. 

I also met someone who got angry at our dinner Cus there wasnt any vegetables on the table. This brother was like oh god do you know how unhealthy this meal is, theres no greens at all?!  
(THERE WAS VEGETABLES OKAY, IT WASNT A SINGLE DISH) He stormed out after the dinner, I was chasing after him and he never turned back. Never replied to my messages ever again poof vanished into thin air. 

I have discussed this with my friend (countless times),about me attracting all these unfortunate events in life. I was watching Emily in Paris season 2 and I cant breathe at the ending. Which led to another discussion with him about my dating life.

I tried to learn new stuff and make more sophisticated conversations with new people but they always ended up talking about drilling me over in their bed. Or overly attached guys who are like why arent you replying me instantly. 

I actually have no idea if whatever I typed makes sense to anybody. I felt like Im just blabbering nonsense. But thank you if you actually read the whole thing. 

Thank you again kind people for reading this nonsense. Im actually full of shit, like both literally and metaphorically. Why is it so hard to find someone that can understand my random shit and me being a shit machine that probably shit many times in a day(jk,I actually do if I have diarrhoea). 

Thank you,
Shit gay male creature 
Single 26 
Probably taking a dump right now


TL;DR
I kept attracting people that I find weird. 
Am I just unlucky?
Or are they really weird?
Or am I weird?"

Comphet(?) Confusion,whorlaxdotorg,ainbow,"Hi! 16-year-old girl here. 

Ive known for years that Im on the asexual spectrum, though have only recently began identifying as greysexual rather than asexual. Ive also known that Im not heterosexual/heteroromantic for years now, having attraction to men, women and non-binary people.

Ive been using the term pan grey-ace to describe me, because it seems to describe me quite well. However, after some introspection, Ive realised that my attraction to men is more limited and complex than my attraction to women and non-binary people. A lot of the time, I can trace my attraction to guys to comphet stuff, or me just putting too much value into the attention/affection of men because of society enforcing the idea. 

I can experience extreme platonic attraction to men where I just like their attention and want them to pay attention to me. This doesnt really happen with the girls and women around me (Id include enbies in this too, but I dont have much IRL experience with them)

As I havent had many non-fictional crushes nor any romantic experience in my short lifetime, I find it hard to understand if Im actually attracted to men or if I just like the idea of men being attracted to me because of the societal importance placed upon male approval. Even if Im not romantically (only platonically) attracted to a guy, Ill still have an extreme desire for his attention, something that doesnt happen with other genders.

I just need some outsider perspectives on all of this. I think it will help me to find this easier to figure out.

If you have any questions that would help you give me better advice/responses, please go ahead and ask."

Help talking about gender identity,originalcupcakecat,ainbow,"Recently my nibling came out as non-binary leaning toward male, and this reminded me of a conversation I had with my tween sometime last month.

My kid has almost exclusively non-binary friends, which when I was their age was something that didn't exist in my world, so I'm really happy that she knows and is supportive of her friends, especially when I know some people aren't. We were talking about  her friends and kid said she was non-binary too. Here is where I think I messed up, I asked if that meant she identified as neither male nor female, and she said she didn't know. So I asked if she felt more male or more female and she said she still didn't know. So I told her that she identifies as female (I gave her examples of why I think this, like she likes to wear femanine clothes and things like that),, and so we still refer to her as she/her.

I explained I didn't want her to identify as non-binary just because her friends do. If she is I want her to be able to say she is because she feels that way, but I don't know if I explained that well to her. 

Is there anything I can do/ask next time we have this conversation that doesn't dismiss her identity, but also can reassure me that she has reached the decision on her own and not just so she can fit in with her friends?"

(TW) Christmas,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey its dad checking in on everyone hoping youre having a merry Christmas. I love you and Im so proud of you. 

I know today is going to be tough for some of us. Today some of you will have to hide who you really are. Some of you will not be able to bring your partner to Christmas because of homophobic or transphobic family. Some of my trans family will have to go to using your deadname and dress according to your agab. 

It makes this time of year hard for a lot of lgbtq people. Just remember inside who really are. You may not be able to tell anyone or show anyone today, but it doesnt diminish who you really are. Youre still lesbian, gay,bi,trans,queer, intersexed, asexual etc. Nothing they say or asks you to do changes that. You are still you. Youre strong and courageous. Youre beautiful and handsome. Youre valid just as you are. 

Its not fair to hide but theyre instances where we have to. Family is especially difficult for us to navigate because we love them we dont want to hurt them. Its hard for young people especially because they are forced against their will to hide to not embarrass the family . Just hang on to the knowledge that one day you will be free. 

My dms are open if anyone needs to talk or vent or just rant. 

Merry Christmas

Today is Christmas. Why can't I enjoy it?,belltyj,ainbow," I'm asexual sapphic trans fem. Holidays for me have always been bitter sweet. I can almost never ask for what I truly want and I almost never got what I did end up asking for anyway. And it's always just 1 item so it's not hard.

Every family gathering wants to force me to be a certain way that I don't like being. Like dressing like a suited up guy or taking pictures or speaking infront of lots of people. 

Idk what this post is about really. I just always feel horrible this time of year. I almost wish I could just make up a new holiday to celebrate whenever else a d just ignore Chrismas completely. 

But it's not all bad every year. My partners have been there for me the past few and it makes me a little less depressed through all the garbage"

Want My Mom to Meet my GF and She Says No,ag-honeybee,ainbow,"So I (27f) spoke to my mom earlier and said that the next time I visit I wanted her (my mom), me, and my gf (24f) to have lunch. And my mom flat out said no. It crushed me. She's known that we've been dating for a while and though I've brought up the subject before she's never flat out refused like that. She told me she ""refused to accept my reality"" and that ""this is not the future I've predicted for you."" 

I know that I'm going to choose myself, my life, and my own happiness over her desires but that doesn't make things easier. I hate it. I hate that she doesn't ask about my girlfriend who is wonderful and interesting and a great partner. I hate how my happiness comes second to her close-mindedness. I hate that I can't sit down and have lunch with my girlfriend and my mom, something so simple and so ordinary. 

Anyway, merry Christmas guys."

Gender preference vs identity?,RedFoxBlackCat,ainbow,"Hey peeps. 

Recently, I've been exploring my femininity as a cis guy. And I've found that I quite strongly prefer femininity to masculinity, in terms of how I'd ideally like to present. At one point, I had a small crisis of identity, questioning my gender and such. But I've come to realise that, while I identify as a man, I'd find being a girl...preferable, I guess? 

Maybe I'm rooting my identity and concept of gender too strongly in aesthetics and my appearance. But I've seen it said that asking oneself if one would press a button to change gender is a sort of litmus test for trans people. But to me it merely reveals preference, rather than identity. Are these really so different? Or am I oversimplifying things?

Sorry if this is the wrong place, but it's been on my mind, and maybe someone has something to say. 

Merry Christmas."

When I was done I waited for my family to get their shopping done I striked up a conversation with a group of... clearly queer individuals. 

The group consisted of a girl with a lesbian pride pin, a trans woman, a trans man, and their one straight passing guy friend. And funniest of all, I popped into their conversation about mimics of all things. 

(Mimics are an entity in Dungeons and Dragons. They're carnivorous shapeshifting creatures who are most commonly seen taking the form of either books or chests)

""I've always said that modern mimics would take the form of Amazon packages. They'd eat the package theives,"" - Me.

I said this to the straight passing guy, and without missing a beat, he told his friends about what I said and he used my correct pronouns. (I was dressed super gay and have been presenting as androgynous more successfully recently so that was probably a big indicator)

I could count so many strangers whose names I never had the chance to learn respect me and my identity. And it makes me sick that my own family can't do the same."

This is for the guys out there who want threesomes or group sex with their partner, but their significant other doesn't want to.

Does it mean you don't love them as much? Or that you can't commit 100% or that you want to have sex with others? Or that it's a fetish or fantasy for you?

As the holidays approach its a lonely time for a lot of us, especially those with homophobic or transphobic family. Christmas, Hanukah, Kwanza, etc all should be time we spend with family, yet so many of us in the lgbtqia+ community have been alienated by our blood family. All because of who we love were treated like outcasts among our family and if per chance were allowed to come to the holidays were not allowed to bring our partner or talk about our sexuality or gender in any form. 

I have been separated from my birth family for many years and I would be lying if I said it doesnt still hurt some. I have learned over the years though its not blood that makes you family its love and understanding. I know myself and a lot of others here are proud to be part of that family. 

We are here to love you and accept you just as you are. If youve read my post before this one you know I took in my ex wifes step son who is ftm and hes learning now family is not about blood. 

I cried with him last night because when I asked what he wanted for Christmas?  He said Ive already got it someone who sees the boy in me. Thats all his parents had to do just see him. Realize hes still the same personality same energy same child but no they chose to cast him aside.

But
There is a transgender character called Cecilia who after we follow her through a drug problem and bashing and her own transition, she comes out to her mother who accepts her. Its a really beautiful touching scene but the subtitles pull you out of the moment with [Christopher weeps], dead naming her in her own coming out scene. 
I understand Disney cant correct everything and likely outsourced the captions but it still matters. The subtitles had never mentioned Cecilias dead name before (descriptively) even when she went by her dead name. It pretty much undermines the entire show and Cecilias whole arc.

Dont get me wrong, she is totally my type, absolutely stunning (model and mini-celebrity in her country) but this happens every time I develop romantic feelings for a woman, I lose my sexual desire for them I do not know why this happens to me but it happened in my previous relationships before. We are a long-distance relationship (I met her online and we havent met in real-life yet) but we have only talked about sex blatantly one time because I thought we should have a conversation about it (since that is what normal couples do, right?) but it felt very bland since I wasnt really feeling the passion and was just asking her about her sexual experience (she does not have any).

When I masturbate or fantasize, I never think about her and if I do, I will lose my motivation or erection and be put-off. I still get horny and turned-on if I imagine and fantasize about other woman who I feel no romantic feelings for (these women are just random people online that I do not know and it has nothing to do with physical attraction, my girlfriend is better looking than the women I fantasize about, its just Im not in a relationship with them and have no love for them). I also feel like a creep or pervert if I have sexual thoughts about my girlfriend and I feel wrong if I bring up sexual topics with them. I dont think this is normal but this has happened before with two previous girlfriends (only have dated three women in my life, my current girlfriend and two ex-girlfriends).

Now for my two ex-girlfriends, I'll talk about my experiences with them when we were dating. With my previous ex-girlfriend, I also had met her online and never met in real-life but we dated for two years over the internet and only talked about sex a handful of times the entire time, felt the same way then too. As for my other ex-girlfriend (the first woman I ever dated or had a serious relationship with), I actually did meet her in real-life and had sex with her but she initiated it a lot of the time and I never sexually fantasized about her or thought about her when I was masturbating during the time we dated and the sex felt very unfulfilling and boring to me when we had it but it was okay-ish. I vividly remember kind of forcing myself to orgasm while masturbating to a photo in underwear she sent me because I wanted to feel ""normal"". I cannot really compare the sexual experiences I had with her to anything else since she was the only person I ever had sex with in my life so-far.

I do watch porn and I guess I kind of have an addiction to porn and masturbation. I used it for a long time to cope with my underlying depression. It's just sad that I'd rather spank my monkey to porn than talk to my girlfriend about sexual things or even sexting with her. I also feel like maybe she would not like it., even though she has given no indication to suggest so. It's just I feel like women do not like sex, especially with someone like me, so why should I bother or trouble her with my sexual urges (this is how my mind rationalizes it)?

I guess my view is not healthy but I feel very immoral, disgusting, and evil if I think about my girlfriend in a sexual manner. I think I am doing something bad and reprehensible. I do suffer from depression and low self-esteem. Been seeing a therapist for it to improve my social anxiety, depression, and learning how to control it. My social anxiety has gotten better but Im not completely normal yet.

Its not that I dont love or have romantic feelings for her, I still strongly desire her company and always dream of going on dates with her, cuddling, kissing, holding hands, and spending our time together and lives, its just the sex stuff that I am having an issue with. I am pretty socially undeveloped and not good at interacting with other human beings. Trying my best to learn, though. How can I develop a more satisfying, alive, and healthier sexual connection with the women I am in a relationship with?

**Edit:** Going to add additional details about my religious upbringing and past trauma, in-case it is helpful for diagnosis and advice.

I used to be a very devout follower of Sikhism and was raised around my religious grandfather who used to take me to the temple very often. The religion teaches that lust is an evil that inhibits spiritual progress and we have to always control it or else it will destroy us. I no longer follow the religion devoutly (consider myself a cultural Sikh now, not a religious one) but perhaps it left an imprint on me. Also, my mother slapped and hit me and publicly humiliated me in-front of my entire family when she caught me watching pornography when I was a child.

---

**TLDR;** I am in a relationship with a women but I feel no sexual attraction to her even though I love her. This happens every time I fall in-love and date a woman, all of my sexual lust for them vanishes. I have a naturally high sex drive and have a hard time controlling it, often masturbate more than once a day but I just never think about her or involve when I do it or anything sexual. What do I do to fix this and up my libido for women I am romantically interested in?"
I wish I could take them all in,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey everyone dad checking in on this foggy Saturday morning. I hope everyone is doing good and having a great weekend. 

Well I had a first my ex wife contacted me. Her new husband has children who are lgbtq. He has a son who is bi a daughter who is lesbian and now a trans male son. They contacted me because they didnt know what to do. Him and her are so homophobic they are confused as to what to do. They are reaching out to me for advice. They are convinced they have done something wrong. They are of the mindset its a sin its a phase etc. I tried telling them its not but they wont hear it. They were hoping I would be willing to talk him out of it. They were wrong. I told them that even though hes 14 he knows what he is. Now theyre wanting me to take him I told them I would gladly take him in if he wants to. Turns out hes thrilled at the idea so now I have another child for Christmas and Im so happy hes got some where to stay. 

Remember my dms are always open if you need to talk. Btw if you want to know more about the situation feel free to message me.

Question about Coming out,The_Solace99,ainbow,"Hi all, 

So, this is a nerve wrecking topic for me. I have been in christianity for a long time, just having left it mentally and emotionally, having really decided where to yet. As ive gone through alot of things, ive come to terms internally with my identity and beyond sure i know what it is. That said, I dont know how to come out when i feel ready to others elsewhere (i will only do that once i leave the situation im in first)."
"So I am out as a GNC woman, and my mom has clearly shown me that she supports me being LGBT, However, I'm scared to come out as a demigirl, which I am 90% sure I am.",Comprehensive_Fox_79,ainbow,"When I thought about this a while ago, I kinda came out to my mom casually in the parking lot of a target, and she said that I'm probably just an andro girl, but that she'll love me regardless of who I am. I was happy that she supported me, but at the same time, I felt like she wanted me to suppress who I was.  (she said that she loved me but that I was probably just GNC if I was even gender-variant at all.

Also, when I asked for a binder that next day, she ordered me 2 binder bras online. (they are just sports bras that give me a flat looking chest because my cup size is small) and I was VERY happy to have them. Also, my mom let me get a haircut, and she did not bring up the trans topic again apart from apparently going dress shopping with an M2F trans colleague who recently came out at my mom's office.

Also, I only ever get chest dysphoria, and it's COMPLETELY gone when I wear my binder.

How should I re come out?"

Looking for advice since I am volunteering at a homophobic youth group,crazyoboeplayer,ainbow,"I need advice about how to best deal with my church. I feel stuck and I want to do everything I can to help these kids.

This is going to be a mess. I am sorry. I am on mobile and I am still quite shaken. 

I (18F) was raised Catholic. This religion was a huge part of my life for a long time. I have always been an active volunteer, and most people in my church knew and respected me. I volunteer at religious education programs and youth groups for younger students. I myself am a senior in high school. 

Since coming out as a lesbian in June, the blatant discrimination I have witnessed in my church is inexcusable. I have been called so many derogatory terms that I have had to look up the definition of some of them. I had no idea this amount of hate was present in a community that I cared so much about. 

Over the past few months, my faith has deteriorated. I now consider myself an atheist, but my attempt at explaining this to my parents ended in screaming and tears. As an attempt to make me pray the gay away, I am being forced to volunteer even more often. I am at most of the masses volunteering, and I do whatever jobs the church needs Monday through Wednesday. 

The part that Im struggling the most with is the middle school youth group. I am the only out and proud lesbian or gay person in my whole church. Many of the kids in this massive group have come out to me. Nearly all of them are disgusted by themselves. They deserve so much better. I have talked to all of them as much as possible about how the church has changed the Bible and used the church to justify discrimination. I am not letting these kids hate themselves simply because the church is a steaming dumpster fire of hate. 

I try to argue with the youth minister and priests, but only in front of the kids. These worthless, hateful adults are honestly beyond help, but I want the middle schoolers to see one of their youth group leaders is still sticking up for them.

It got a lot worse recently when someone came out to everyone. It proved to be the worst decision possible. She was isolated in every way. Not even the closeted LGBT kids felt safe to go near her for the fear of being associated with her. Its so hard to teach these kids that they dont have to be ashamed of themselves when the climate is so toxic. 

We had a night where kids were able to anonymously ask the priest questions. One of the question slips asked why the church was homophobic. The priest stated: We love homosexuals just as we love all adulterers. And we are not homophobic. We are not *scared* of homosexuals. They went on about how members of the LGBT community have the opportunity to repent at any time and they were ready to accept any of these people. 

The next week was worse. I dont even know how to explain this bullshit. The Catholic Church is extremely transphobic, but this proved that its also just stupid. 

Theres a 14 year old dude that Ill call Albert. He was born physically intersex, but has been going through male puberty. Hes tall and his voice is obviously changing. He has broad shoulders and overall the build of a man. However, his parents had him identify as a female for most of his life since thats what he appeared to be closer to physically at birth or whatever. When I met him, he identified as female, but seemed so happy to tell me he wanted to go by a new name and pronouns. Think of it as a masculine version of a feminine name, like going from Patricia to Pat. Barely a change. The youth ministry has been fighting it. The only thing is that he really is *biologically* like this. There is no valid argument against his gender identity (or anyones, for that matter). Ive been arguing with the constant deadnaming of trans kids for a long time, but I thought they would understand THIS. 

I argued with the youth minister for close to half an hour. I said religion doesnt justify discrimination and she said that arguing against her beliefs was religious discrimination. I got mad. I told her that she was never once the person being discriminated against. 

She somehow turned it into a conversation about gay marriage. It was disgusting. It hurts more knowing she was the person I confided in about my suicidal and self harming tendencies only a few months before this. I trusted her more than anyone, and she was openly homophobic and transphobic. Even worse, she was making children hate themselves. 

Staying at this church is horrible for my mental health. I dont know what to do. Im not experienced or special, but I am not willing to give up on these kids. I go home every Tuesday night after youth group and I just start crying. Usually the tears start before I get in my car. When it comes down to it, my mental health is not whats most significant here. So much more is at stake. They are so desperate for volunteers that they are letting me have a chance to help these people accept themselves. 

It only gets worse. A non-binary fourteen-year-old attempted suicide. They lived, and are still forced to go to church. Their parents sent them to a mental hospital, but for a queer kid, the Catholic Church can undo that progress in mere hours. Its disgusting. I have to be there for them. 

This was mostly a vent, but I need any and all advice I can get. Im sorry this is so long. Im so lost and so frustrated. This religion went from being my rock to my greatest burden in a matter of a few months. In the past few months, Ive been dumped over text, abused, stressed, depressed, and Ive had to get help for the amount of self harming Ive done. 

In some ways, volunteering has worsened my stress. On the other hand, its about my only purpose I have left and I cant give up."

KYN: a new queer hopepunk novel,sobrgnomepress,ainbow,"Hey all! For everyone looking for new queer focused, inclusive content, I'm just here to make a shameless plug for my new novel, **KYN**, from [Sobr Gnome Press.](https://www.sobrgnomepress.com/)

\[Plot teaser\]

**Death isn't Always Fatal**

*In a near post-dystopian future, an immortal assassin fights to defend civilizations last city from the encroaching threat of mysterious invaders  all while struggling to protect those he loves from the twisted machinations of those he was bred to serve.*

Hyperkinetic and irreverent, it's a f\*ck you to the 'Bury your Gays'  trope, and a brazenly campy homage to the cyberpunk classics that birthed the  genre. Filled to its ever-sassy brim with irreverent immortal  assassins, charming hacker boy-toys, and gender fluid sirens,  KYN is a love story to the indomitable spirit of queerness that dares to dream of a new and   better future beyond dystopia.

"Has anyone had a girl friend who was a walking ""girl with a gay best friend"" stereotype?",SirClorox,ainbow,"I'm 19, my best friend is 16, says a lot about the situation lol. Recently she started to act weird, telling her friends how her best friend is gay and how that is so cool and all. One of her friends asked her what face creme she is using and she told her she has it from me and how she always gets her skin and haircare advice from me, because gay guys always have the best cosmetic product recommendations. This kinda annoyed me tbh, but she had some other quirks as well, like telling her friends how she and her gay best friend (me) talk about guys, how I am an ""expert at noticing toxic guys"", to which, girl first of all, fucking ouch. Second of all, when your date refuses to text you, only talks to you about sex and never anything else, clearly lies and manipulates you, leaves you on a date out of nowhere to hang out with another girl, and I point that out, that doesn't make me an expert at noticing toxic guys lmao.

Gender identity and pronouns,Comprehensive_Food51,ainbow,"Gender identity

Hi!

Hope everyone is doing great!

This is addressed to non binary people, especially people with both non binary and binary pronouns (she/they for instance).

I am currently writing a book with as a purpose to show in depth thinking about the lgbtq+ community, its behaviour with people that are not part of it and also those within it (I might make mistakes in english but the book is in french dw lol). In order to build solid thoughts about sexuality, I need to talk about gender identities since sexuality seems to derive from it  because what makes your sexual orientation is the gender(s) or sex(es) that attract you.

Now to explain gender identity I need to prove that it is valid  my purpose here is to build an unshakable reasoning to prove that we are all valid and that our gender identities are not an invention or whatever. Do proofs work with conservatives? The answer is no, of course. However, we cannot fight social conservatism without those rational proofs. Now for they/them, ftm and mtf trans people it's pretty straight forward.

The issue I find is with pronouns that take both from the binary and the non binary. What I'd call ""mixed"" pronouns (she/they, he/they, they/him, they/her), as opposed to ""homogenous"" ones (she/her, he/him, they/them), imply a logical issue. While ""homogenous"" pronouns gender identities can be defended by the fact that been perceived as from another gender causes people to experience dysphoria, ""mixed"" ones are more complicated to defend since accepting one of the binaries while you're a non binary implies that the binary pronoun does not cause you dysphoria, and that therefore you either don't need it or you don't know what's you're actual gender identity yet  and the last conclusion doesn't make sense since I've seen people with ""mixed"" pronouns completely comfortable and happy with it. We can state that it is valid as much as we want, but the truth is that with gender diversity comes a need for inclusion and therefore an effort needs to be made in order to come up with social measures that are suitable for gender minorities specific needs. I am personally convinced that all gender identities are valid. However, if you consider ""homogenous"" pronouns as valid because otherwise people who identify with them would experience distress, it means that people who don't experience dysphoria have an ""unnecessarily"" non conforming gender identity by choice, which is the opposite of what the lgbtq+ community tried to make people understand for so many years, and also that those suitable measures are not needed because it is counter productive for a society to adapt to each person who chooses not to be conforming to what the majority stated as functional and non harming. So yeah, basically I need to rationally  with logic  overcome that argument and show that all gender identities are valid, and for that I need your help! 

 Here are a few questions I have for you:

1- How would you define gender? (A social construct/invention, something intrinsic to the human psychology, something personal etc.)

2- What is your relationship to gender in general and to your gender specifically?

3- What does it means to identify with she/they or he/they or any other ""mixed"" pronouns gender?

4- How would you describe it for yourself  how does it feels like, in what aspect is it different from a she/her or a they/them in terms of experience?

5- How would you defend your gender identity and its validity? (Please try not to answer with something like ""it doesn't hurt anyone"", that's too much of a surface thinking and surprisingly easily attackable)

6- How do you think it would affect you if you were identifying with ""homogenous"" pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them)?

Please try to be specific and precise as you can and to show as much in depth thinking as possible, don't worry about writing a long text, I'll read them all. The idea here is to build reasonings, not just reaffirm our validity as we always do. Saying ""the non binary is a spectrum"" or even ""all genders are valid"" is nice and true, but unfortunately those are not enough as statements to fight for our rights.

I am trying to make a move forward for us all, let's break social conservatism and bigots together!

Ps.: I'm cis bi guy :)

Thank you "
Tis the season,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family Dad checking in here with you hoping you had a great week. Please remember as the holidays are coming closer that I love you I support you and I will always be here for you.


As I mentioned the holidays are fast approaching. Its a time of year when we wanna celebrate the year weve had the year thats coming ahead and we look to do things to make our lives better. Christmas and new years are two of the most popular time for people to come out. Im sure that some of you are already considering it. You know your family situation better than I do so Ill leave it in your hands whether or not its a good idea to proceed. I caution you however make sure its safe to do so. Please make sure youre not gonna put yourself in danger of being abused or in danger of being kicked out and homeless. With some of the religious teachings of today a lot of people have very strict ideas against LGBTQ. So please be sure you know where your family stands if you need someone to talk to or run any ideas by I am always here or Im sure there are others that would be happy to talk to you. Do not put yourself in a situation where you find yourself homeless during the holiday season.  I am a big advocate for living your truth but only when you can do so without harm to yourself. My dms are open if you need anything.

"Is calling someone non-binary ""dude"" offensive?",Jim_Dickskin,ainbow,"I was just informed by my girlfriend that using the terms ""dude"" or ""you guys"" when talking to someone non-binary offends them despite them both having become general terms for any gender.


I call my girlfriend dude, I call my mom dude, I call my male friends dude, I call my trans friend dude. To me it's a completely general term to refer to people, like saying ""you guys"" to a group of girls (to me) seems less creepy than saying ""you girls"".

I don't know if I'm asking this in the right place, but how do non-binary people think of being referred to with general terms like ""dude"" despite it having previously been a gendered term? Or is it still gendered and I'm the only person that uses it as a non-gendered term?

My girlfriend seems to think it's offensive to refer to non-binary people as ""dude"" and since she's binary I figured I would reach out to people who aren't for an answer?


Thank you in advance!"

(TW) toxic people,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey everyone Dad checking in hoping you all have had a great week so far. I want you to remember that I love you I support you and I will be here for you if you ever need anything.

So I kind of wanna talk to you about something thats real prevalent in the LGBTQIA+ community more so than any other community I have been a part of so far. Within our community we face the problem of losing friends and loved ones every time we come out. The biggest loss is family of course especially if you have a very close relationship with your parents. The pain that we feel losing a parent or a sibling or other close family member when we come out almost keeps us from wanting to come out. In fact Ive talked to several people debating if it was worth it. There comes a point in time in your journey were you have to make the decision if its more important for you to come out or stay in the closet to avoid losing someone. I personally believe that it is far better for your mental health to come out and lose those toxic people in your life. Even if its family youre better off without those toxic people bringing you down. You deserve happiness you deserve to live your life on your own terms it is inevitable in life that we have to remove toxic people from time to time.  Yes I understand wanting to preserve your family and youre having a close relationship with your family but if they cannot accept you for who you are are you not better off without them? You must consider how miserable your existence and your life will be trying to keep that secret buried for the sake of your family. I am not advocating that you come out and put yourself in jeopardy of being kicked out or abused especially if youre a minor and have no means of self support. I am however recommending that when you can stand on your own to consider your own happiness rather than that of someone else. My dms are open if you need to talk.

I hope I do not offend anyone, which is for some, this really hard question. All the responses will be held strictly anonymous! Thank you for your time :) (Sorry for my English by the way)"

I know a lot of you live in situations where you cant come out and you cant live your authentic life. Its why we fight daily for equality. It shouldnt have to be about lgbtq rights because were all human. It should be human rights. We should be able to love who we want without prejudice but we cant. We should be able to be proud of who we are but we cant. Truth is we shouldnt have to come out we should be free to love who we want. Im so sick of people being offended because were fighting for our rights. Im tired of people saying we cant have families because the kids will be gay. Really were taking and loving the kids you didnt want but were evil gotcha. Truth is like Ellen says all gay kids were born from straight parents. I want all of you to be able to be proud of who you are and who you love. I want you to be free to pursue your desire without fear of being persecuted. I want you to live your authentic life. Its what were fighting for. I believe one day it will happen one day we wont to come out or at least be afraid to. One day society will evolve but until that day I will fight like hell to change this world. My dms are open if you need to talk.

"Advice Needed. LGBT and Women Anger. Non-Binary Person Here. VERY LONG MESSAGE (read all before commenting, thanks)",fuckingtireddas,ainbow," 

This will be a long message and I need someone to give me advice or show me what is the problem.

I am non-binary, 20+ years old, immigrated from a certain country to the USA. Currently I'm in a conservative area and I can see why people hate conservatism. People here seem very similar to my homeland.

I think I'm non-binary because I don't want to do any body modifications or act like the opposite sex, but I also don't feel comfortable being ""male"". There are some things where I like to be feminine and some where I'm more masculine. My appearance is mostly neutral, though some things are obviously ""gay"". This alongside my low weight guarantees people being uncomfortable around me, judgmental or hostile even though I don't do anything bad to them. So, I'm definitely not going to excuse hate towards LGBT people, that's not the point. I can see how conservatives are wrong with hate.

But what I also see are the experience I've had with LGBT resources, people, online dating and things like that. Some real-life connections, too, most of which made an impression that was even worse than the online one.

Let's start with the easiest to explain. I've been trying to find someone online for a relationship in my area. My experience with straight or those open to the more straight relationship has been terrible. And before you are going to tell me ""it takes time"" or ""you'll find someone"", I want to point out that most women I've talked to had a ""boyfriend"" or numerous people interested in them before they even turned 18. You cannot compare your reality to mine. Nobody would seek me out. If that person has this ""seek you out"" mentality, they'd just go for girls which are more likely to be prettier and have more in common.

I am disgusted by the gender stereotypes those people exhibit: guys can never understand me and only tell me to go to gym, cis women are usually avoiding me because, of course, me having a penis means I can't be their friend unless they keep me far from them until I prove I'm worth keeping. UNLESS they're into yaoi, or they want power fantasy, or they want to feel like a good person. It is never THEM chasing me to be friends.

I've seen those photos of ""girlfriends"" on parties, group photos and I couldn't believe it's actually real until I started looking up people's Facebook and see that these people are real. They really believe that I can't be their friend because I am born male, they get weirded out if I say I'm non-binary and feel more comfortable being friends with women, etc. I mean, I knew how people are, I've been discriminated and hated BEFORE I started showing my unconventional side. But the numbers are too overwhelming. Maybe I'm not lucky with my area in the USA.

I've put countless effort into being friends with someone. I would write down whatever the fuck they'd write me, I'd try to remember the important dates or things and I'd message them first or ask if I'm bothering them with my messages. Not ONCE did I have anyone of these ""friends"" I've been making throughout the years message me first or try to make a normal conversation. They see my message, they might reply to it - some quicker than others, some might take forever, others will just expect me to collect dust in their Instagram/Snapchat follower list. In the end, nobody gives three shits about me and it doesn't matter how much effort I put into it or how much time had passed.

I've had numerous people stop replying, even though nothing bad happened. They'd just get bored of me and disappeared.

You might say ""oh baby, you don't need to chase people who don't want to be friends with you"". Except I don't. I specifically write every single fucking time, ""please, do not contact me if you aren't willing to put the same effort into being friends"". This isn't my first day of trying to be friends with someone online. And yet it always goes the same way. And no, it doesn't go any differently in real life, if anything it's worse because nobody has the time, and I take a long time to get comfortable in person.

Relationship? Even easier to explain. They do not consider me. Of course, being a woman means they cannot settle for a shorter partner, for a partner that earns less and looks ""kinda gay and not masculine but doesn't really strike my BTS kink"". My choice is limited by my status (immigrant), height, weird appeal, mental health issues, etc..

""Oh baby you just need to wait for your love!"" - except that's not how it works for people like me. Maybe for you. Maybe for someone who is going to be chased, who will have large circles of friends - I don't need any of that shit, at best I'd be open to have 2-3 friends that I know would remember me; any of the fake connections and nobody is going to randomly come up to me and say they'd like to go somewhere. It doesn't happen to awkward people like me. It happens only to you and you don't even fucking try to take my perspective and see my reality when you tell me ""oh baby, you just gotta wait for it! See, my boyfriend and I we met accidentally HAHA! my third cousin's dog introduced us"". This won't happen to me just like it never happened in my 20+ years of life.

I can already see some of you typing ""oh! what a charmer!"", ""ur lonely cause ur so negative"".

Yes, I am mad and fucking negative NOW because this isn't the first year I am living through this shit and not the first time I am asking for advice just to: a) be ignored; b) get a ""baby you just gotta wait"" c) be told ""GO TO GYM, BRO, IT'LL HELP I PROMISE"". I am not negative and I keep track of it and pay attention when I'm talking to someone in private. I reread messages and analyze whether I was too negative, too.

You can go and sue someone for harassing you, and you'll probably make a shitton of money if you're in the USA. Meanwhile, I am living with emotionally abusive relatives who have been terrorizing me for years and damaged my health. But as soon as I mention it to anyone, even if they ask me, I become unappealing, too negative and someone they'd rather avoid and absolutely never even consider as a partner. Nobody is going to admit that but this is the thought process. Meanwhile, all the women I see with boyfriends or girlfriends still live with their parents and don't bother earning a lot.

Whenever I mention any of this or criticisize females, I am banned on whatever platform it is and called an ""incel"". ""Okay"", I think. Perhaps I am an incel. I went on two incel forums, waited until they approved me and browsed the forums. While I agree with the incels' hate towards injustice done to males, I don't like the way they hate LGBT people (at least on the resources I saw), act racist and xenophobic and generally seem to be mad they're not the ""chads"" who get model-like women.

I don't agree with incels on most of the shit they write, except the injustice towards male which is real. As soon as the guys find someone, they drop this criticism of women and accept the reality - out of fear of being alone. And women will get away with saying ""oh, all men think about is sex/food"", ""oh, all men suck"", etc.

LGBT... I'll try to keep it short because I wrote too much already.

I've talked to a few LGBT in real life. Two gay guys, both of which were creeps obsessed with sex. One girl-lesbian who was as dumb and shallow as a rock. All she cared about is posting ""cute"" instagram pictures, like she's a teenager.

I'm yet to see a calm and non-toxic LGBT person in real life. I don't know why I'm supposed to censor my thoughts if this is how my experience has been.

Oh, and that trans guy I was talking to. He was making childish drawings of dogs pissing, and claimed he's under the LGBT umbrella... because liking to watch dogs piss makes you LGBT... apparently?

The Internet - mostly negative experiences, too. I won't list them all because there was a lot, but I'll summarize my main issues.

Obsession with drugs - why would anyone kill their brain with drugs is beyond me. I don't want anything to do with that.

Trans people - I tried to be understanding, but I don't feel comfortable around them. MTF people act like the most spoiled daddy princesses on a pony. FTM trans act like the most toxic dude bros you'll meet, grow out nasty beards because, of course, what does being a male mean? HAVING A BEARD! What does being a female mean? ""UR SO CUTE BABY I LUV SNUGGLES HERES MY PLUSH MISTER DOODOO"".

I don't have a problem with whatever they want to be. I don't see why they can't accept the fact that they're born as one sex and instead focus on dismantling GENDER STEREOTYPES instead of ENFORCING THEM, but hey whatever. Let's buy lingerie and cut the dicks - because that's what defines a woman, right? No dick, full of lingerie closet, snuggles. There's nothing else to being a woman, right? There I thought we're supposed to treat everyone regardless of stereotypes.

Obsession with sex. It always has to be sex, it always has to be something nasty, it always has to be about having a personal harem - EXCUSE ME - ""open relationship"" or ""non-monogamous relationship"". ""Back to the monke"".

But you know what's the most interesting thing? It's always these alternative looks that obsess with sex. I don't see ugly people doing that, I don't see awkward people like me being obsessed with it. Why? Do they ALL have no desire for it? Why is it always these alternative short-haired people or masculine dudes with an obvious ""vibe"" of sex? You yourself say that looks shouldn't define a person but these stereotypes are real.

Shallowness. I cannot stress this enough. I feel like a lot of the LGBT people I talked to were robots. Especially those on medicine .What kind of fucking life is that if you just sleep all day long or if you're sleepy from the medicine you pump into your body? I suffer from mental health pain every day, but I find things to enjoy and to keep my mind sharp.

I don't think it's just the medicine at fault here. It's also this weird childish ""oh my gosh i kissed a girl!!! and i'm a girl!!! That's like soooooo coooool""... except the person who thinks this way (subconsciously) is not a teen. Why is this immaturity being normalized? Why can't you act mature and not act like you're a teenager writing a poem to her crush?

Communism/socialism/leftism. I am from a country which lived through these things. All the ""beautiful future"" of communism/socialism/leftism. Free medicine, shitty EVERYTHING. If you want it, go to Syberia and have fun! Free medicine, free school, ONE brand of everything (I mean there's more but you'll be able to afford only one, no matter where you work). Or go to North Korea - beautiful nukes, beautiful cult of personality, beautiful body-positive man in charge of everyone. Or go to China - more nukes, more cult of personality and poverty. Coincidence? Don't see what unites all these countries? Why is it so fucking hard to read the fucking history book? Why is the half of LGBT people I meet cannot understand that these things have been tried by people who perhaps knew a little more than you did? And they failed miserably?!

I don't want to talk about politics too much. All I'm saying is I'm fucking tired of people adding me back just because they have a kink for Stalin, and they expect me to listen to their bullshit dreams of communism - but this time! This time it will work! We'll just paint the red flag into a rainbow, and it'll work! Promise!

I mentioned being an immigrant. You know what else I noticed among LGBT people? Absolute zero interest in whatever issues I face as an immigrant. Yeah, I'm white and ""born male"". What of it? Do you think the southern racist dudes would accept me if I dropped my non-binary stuff and acted like them?

I can't get hired on anything that pays more than 10$ an hour in this shithole. They see my name, they see my nationality, immigrant status (legal but who the fuck cares) and reject me without an interview or anything for jobs that high school kids get in two weeks. That's BEFORE they see me in person and see how I have trouble with social contact, how I am twitchy at times because of bipolar disorder and other issues and how off I look to them because of my looks or whatever.

People, yes, including your favorite and oh so very vulnerable dark-skinned people, discriminate me and laugh in my face because of my nationality and the realization that I am not a protected minority; the realization that I won't hurt them back in return, the realization that they can laugh at me because of my weird accent and I'll let them have their power fantasy. These are the vulnerable people you keep talking about?! My workplace is like 70% black people, I've also been at other places where they work and they were FAR more inconsiderate, disrespectful and discriminating than the southern white dudes and their gals.

But of course I'm a white male, so I'm set for life! And alllllll the beautiiifuuul LGBT people I see online or in real life, all the NAZI-SMASHERS! all the communist-dreamers, all the drug-enjoyers and sex-aficionado - they all know better, they all know I am not struggling and only the black trans lives deserve support, fundings, gofundme and cashapps. BLM, DEFUND THE POLICE! - YEAH, I'M A GOOD PERSON NOW AND MY RACIST TWEETS FROM WHEN I WAS A TEEN DO NOT EXIST BECAUSE I PUT BLM IN MY BIO!!!

the last paragraph is related to the shit I see all the time online. Colored hair, unhealthy sexual drive and the never-ending ""BLM!!!"" in caps.

Remember to look very hard in the mirror the next time you complain about white supremacists, incels and whoever else makes you feel good about yourself. Half of the people I saw on incel forum were there just because they were as desperate as I am and unprotected or afraid to admit their LGBT tendencies, and you know why? Because this is what you make of this LGBT image, because you can't be ""open-minded"" unless you accept dog-fuckers furries and the sex-crazed ""adults"" which act more immature than some of the minors I saw in my homeland.

I am open to hear anyone's thoughts if you think I am wrong about something. Negative comments don't do anything to me (sorry to disappoint) and will be ignored. Something constructive and respectful - I'll read it and reply to it. But you don't give a shit, why would you? Minority like me does not make you feel good, it won't make for a good Twitter bio, it won't be fun to tell your friends about (other than to laugh)."

All my friends (literally every single one) are either bi, gay, lesbian, or nonbinary, so Ive always been very in tune with the LGBT community/ considered myself a strong ally.  Ive considered myself straight my whole life, and my friends know that, but theyve always made jokes about me not being straight.  x is never beating these allegations and stuff like that.  Its never bothered me at all, but recently Ive been sort of confused with my sexuality and Im know that Im bi now.  Two things: 1) how on Earth did they know before I did, and 2) its making it hard to come out to them.  To expand on 2, I really dont want their first response to me coming out to be we knew cause thatll kind of just make me feel shitty.  Its affirming, but not in the way that I want to feel supported, you know?  Its really hard for me to put this into words, but I dont want them to think that since they knew, they can minimize the time and questioning Ive had over the last year into a continuation of the joke theyve been saying over the last few years.  I want them to be happy that I know myself more, not that Ive caught up to the joke of the group.  Its been so hard to approach them about this, also partly because of the fear that they'll think Im only trying to fit in with their group (which I know they wont do, but its hard to realize that).  What should I do?  I want to tell my friends that Im bi, but how?  How did they know before me?"

I wish I could say everyone in the salon was supportive but a few guest were quite rude. The dad however held his anger and simply replied if it makes my son happy as a parent why wouldnt I let him express himself. 

The boy was probably around 8 or 9 I didnt ask but that dad was so proud to be that boys father. I talked to him and he believes his son maybe trans but is letting him figure it out.

"Asking for debate on gender identity : I'm feeling uncomfortable with all those gender labels, if we want to break the norms and clichs couldn't we just aim to abolish it?",allhailtheholycheese,ainbow,"Not sure this is the right place but there's a question I've got in mind for so long, I really want to discuss it with people who are aware of this subject better than me.

Basically, I never understood why some LGBTQIA+ people would say they, for example, feel like a girl and would wear make-up and ""feminine"" clothes to feel more like themselves. Or other people would cut their hair short to look more ""boyish"" as if long hair was something feminine. For another exemple, genderfluid persons would wear different clothes or acting different depending on the way they feel from a period to another. Why couldn't just we say that we like wearing this and that, acting like this or that, and just not talk about our sex or gender? Why do we have to stick a label on it?

I support freedom for everyone, my opinion is that anyone can wear and do whatever they want and should be able to live in peace, without being harassed for the choices they make. It would be so much simpler if society wouldn't assign make up for pussyonly-owners, or facial hair for dickonly-wearer (sorry intersex folks i'm too confused to include you yet, don't want to offend) etc, yet when I watch video makers or read bloggers to learn more about it, I sometimes hear or read that for example they started to wear dresses to feel more in line with their ""feminine"" side and it annoys me a little because in my opinion it perpetuates the norms and clichs we actually fight against. It still makes some stuff boy things or girl things...  

Moreover, I often read there aren't any clear definition for gender identity labels, for everyone feels themselves their own way. Consequently, labels don't seem to ease communication.

To sum up, i think gender doesn't really exist, and that everything is about personality and tastes. And that labels may reinforce norms.

So now I explained myself, I would like to ask you all a few questions in order to benevolently debate :

\- what is it to feel like a boy or girl, and isn't it in some way related to society's fucked up norms?

\- what if their weren't any gender label at all? What if we just avoid to use any terms like boy, girl, genderfluid, demigirl-boy, agender, etc? 

\-Eventually, does gender really exist and if not, why naming it?

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope I didn't hurt anyone, tell me if I've been tactless. I don't have anybody to discuss it and tell me more and I'm very interested in the subject because in the end, it's all about freedom.

Thank you all for reading and answering &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

PS : if you ever wonder, in those labels-related terms I'm what you may call an agender afab, who suffered from family pressure to show my curves with dresses and skirts, to take care of my face and to sit right not spreading legs. As a teen I thought I wanted to be a boy, until I realized it wasn't what I had between my legs that mattered, it was the fact that people wouldn't let me wear large clothes and talk loud and tell dirty jokes because ""that's not how girls act"". Calling myself agender or anything else bothers me because again, I'm against the norms related to one's sex."

I've been against stereotypes and always will be, but as someone who used to think that being LGBT simply meant being open to the idea of falling love with someone regardless of what they have in their pants, I start to realize that's not the case. The point of it (for most people) seems to be the weirdness and ""originality"", not open-mindedness or love. People are immature, the majority is, and they'll use whatever idealized image they feel most comfortable with to justify this immaturity.

I think this is the most accurate description of how I feel, but I'm too scared to admit it out loud. I don't have a lot of people to talk to about this. I feel so alone. I want to talk to other genderfluid people, but I don't know any. I feel like I have to get through all of this on my own, and it makes me so sad. I've mentioned this to my friends, but they're all cishet.

Thinking about all of this has drained so much of my energy, that I can't get myself to study or do homework. I joined two discord servers for trans/enby people and they seem nice so far. I still feel alone, though. Has anyone experienced this? I would appreciate tips on dealing with this loneliness."

However, when I look on a wider scale I see way more pushback. Worldwide, more places seem to be anti-LGBTQ+ than pro-LGBTQ+. Even in more progressive areas a lot of people support bigotry against queer people. Texas tries to ban gay marriage, bigoted group seem to start getting more support, more and more celebrities (like Rowling and Dawkins) start openly sharing bigotry, the media reports more articles against queer people, hate crimes against LGBTQ+ are rising and more."

We can create stem cells from our body that can differentiate into either sperm or egg cells. A lesbian couple can have 1 person have her cells be differentiated into sperm cells and inseminate the other. A gay couple can have one person have his cells differentiate into an egg cell. This egg cell can be inseminated by the other person in vitro. This is IVF with extra steps. The embryo will be implanted into a female surrogate.

Like other forms of reproduction for same gendered couples, gay males will have to pay more than gay females. However, we have an XY sex determination system. A male would be XY while a female would be XX. 2 females will only result in female children while 2 males can result in either male or female children.

Discrimination at work by white blonde woman at yogurt factory,JacksonCorbett,ainbow,"So background. I'm a gay Indian-American with autism who use to be a lab technician at Upstate Farms Cultured Products in Batavia NY.

I was recently discriminated by a homophobic colleague at work who used her position to get me fired.

When I was hired on, I worked with a blonde white woman I'll just call CD. Now because the factory was new there was only one lab tech, CD. But she didn't take kindly to shareing her lab, especially with people who were in her words ""different"".  She even went as far to mock my mannerisms and condescendingly told me to ""act like a normal man""

She was the type who tried her best to make me fail. She would intentionally lie to me on how to do the job and continually gas light me on tasks like inventory. It got so bad I asked the production supervisor to check my work. Though even though he confirmed my data was correct after checking FOUR times, CD would still gaslight me and misrepresent my performance at work.

Though I did struggle at first I'd say I got the hang of the job to the point where I was finishing my duties hours ahead of schedule. Even the lab supervisor said I was doing well.

But the catch is my progress was reported only to the upper command through CD. CD would intentionally make my progress look worse than it was because she couldn't stand a gay person of color in the lab.

So when my assessments came up, it was always through the lens crafted by CD. Because she was the ""golden girl"" of the yogurt factory she used her influence to have me fired.

I just needed to vent.

This is the third time I've faced discrimination at work but this was the most blatant and damaging event I've been through.

Fuck CD, that racist homophobe and Fuck upstate farms."

I have always been an eternal optimist, focusing on my dream and not giving a f\*\*k about what was going on around me. I think I was genuinely happy. I am gay and Ive never came out but I think people just always knew, I remember bullying started before I even understood what sex mean. Fast forward this week, I got voted out of my school club I myself established. Which was kind of the only thing I had and care for (its a dietary club). Everything I tried to avoid just resurfaced; the way my parents and sibling wont even look at me and ignore me, how my church refused me to attend service and choirs until I get treated, the way I got voted out of the soccer team, the way people avoid me at school, how my friends all leave me always.  I used to escape by doing activism but I just dont know if I can do this anymore, I use to wake up and look forward in life but really Im just very very very tired and exhausted.

In grade 9 a homophobic boy in my class said AND I QUOTE My girlfriend is suffering from the homosexual fetish but Im helping her get through it. I am suffering from my own fetish. Full stop and didnt elaborate. What do you think he meant??,ThePipYay,ainbow,"
He announced it to the entire class pretty much unprompted (maybe someone had vaguely mentioned gay people or something). I remember everyone being too stunned to speak. The school was very progressive and nearly everyone hated him already and referred to him as The Nazi (which he mightve been. I think he was racist too). 


Im going to go to my grave wondering what on earth his fetish was, and why he felt the need to mention it.


(In case anyones wondering, he definitely didnt have the girlfriend much longer because a year later he asked ME out. That was actually the exact moment I fully decided I was aromantic asexual, so Im grateful to him for that)"

Was this a crush or just a friend (me low key realizing while writing this post),Final_Special_451,ainbow,"
So there is this girl I think I like. I think I started having feelings for over a month.  It kinda started when I was away and sick for a while and when I saw her again she was so excited to see me and I thought it was cute. She came and whispered in my ear Im so happy your here and (I dont remember it very well because I was excited and things went by so fast) something went through my entire body kinda like electricity. I couldnt think about her for the rest of the day platonically. Being her gf made me weirdly happy. I found myself unintentionally being awkward and flirting. Then I found out she was pan and had a partner already. The next few weeks things werent all the same once i realized we could never be a thing. I felt kinda jealous and felt awful about liking her. And I was questioning if I really did like her at all because sometimes I thought of her in a platonic way and other times I didnt.  Now my supposed crush on her is draining quickly were most of the time its normal but sometimes its more than that.  After this Ive never been so sure ever that I am queer. Ive been questioning for over a year and realizing that moments in my life werent as *heterosexual* as I made them out to be. I feel like ive  been attracted to guys but the thought of being with them makes me a little bit uncomfortable idk if its always been that way, but lots of my fantasies of guys were just me dating and marrying them so I could make others happy and pleased sense i grew up Christian. But i have recalled having crushes on very feminine guys. But me being with girls makes me happier then being with guys. It seemed like I was bending over backwards to convince myself Im straight.

Lifes not easy,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey everybody dad checking in on you letting you know I love you and support you. 

I was watching Supergirl on Netflix earlier today and I love how inclusive the lgbtqia+ community is represented. The shows characters all have love and support and its really touching. 

As I was watching it though I couldnt help but feel sadness. There are so many in the community that dont get the love and support. They either have family who are not accepting or they live in a country where they cant come out. 

There was a quote in the show where someone said  every child should have the opportunity to grow up and be their authentic self. Its true they should. Unfortunately for a lot of the community its not the case. So many of our fellow community family members dont have the opportunity to grow up like that.

Home should be a place of freedom. A place where you can be yourself and sadly for a lot of people its the one place they arent allowed to be themselves. 

I wish life was as simple as it is on tv, unfortunately right now were still having to fight. We fight hatred and stigma everywhere we turn. Even though laws have given us some rights society still looks at us as mistakes. I know Im not a mistake Im just as much a valid person as they are so are you. Our fight now is to get society to realize were not evil we just love differently than they do. 

My dms are open if you need to vent or talk. 

Love dad"

Is reconciling with family worth it?,julietteAfterDark,ainbow,"Curious to hear perspectives from people that experienced family rejection and later reconciled, or entertained the idea. Was it worth it?

For some on what happened to me (trigger warnings implied):

I'm 26 now, and transgender. I transitioned at 18 in Germany. This led my parents to force me into two sessions of conversion therapy by threatening homelessness, and once I refused further sessions, kicking me out and making me homeless. I cut contact with them after that. Both never used my name or pronouns. My mother gaslight me by lying to me that other family members had rejected me, and by making up fake childhood stories to ""prove"" that I couldn't be trans. She explicitly outlined that she would do everything in her power to make my life impossible, so I would have no choice but to detransition. Both of them attempted to convince me that I was mentally ill. My father once pretended to become more accepting, but only did so in order to to gain access to, and threaten, the doctors that prescribed me HRT. He also sexually abused me when I was younger. Some extremely very fucked up shit happened, I have PTSD as a result. I moved abroad, and I no longer speak my native tongue, as German has become a PTSD trigger for me.

At the time I transitioned, being trans was not yet known about the way it is now. The conversation therapy was conducted at a major government clinic and paid for with public health insurance, giving their treatment of me broader social backing. Though my parents also couldn't have been entirely unfamiliar with the concept of being trans as my mom had a classmate in high school that transitioned in the 70s. It's not like they couldn't have known better.  Either way though, it's fair to say that public opinion has since shifted. Last year, coerced conversion therapy became a criminal offense in Germany. Once society supported ""their side"", but things have changed now.

And so now, they've both reached out wanting to reconnect, for the first time using my name and pronouns etc. And I'm honestly extremely hesitant? Sure, these people are supposed to be family, but also deeply endangered and traumatized me. They almost killed me. And I'm not convinced they're willing to recognize that and take responsibility for it. Instead it might just as well be them doing the bare minimum (no longer actively seeking to force me into detransition) and thinking that entitles them to a relationship with me.

Thoughts? Can anyone relate to this?"

Blowing Straight Guys at a Public Gloryhole,hurricanenow,ainbow,"I was told by an alleged super cruiser that if you put your mouth or fingers up to a public gloryhole like in a park or store while a guy is peeing, that many straight guys will actually consider getting sucked off. He was talking about situations where the straight guy either didnt know the gloryhole existed or at least wasnt expecting a cocksucker to be in the adjacent stall. He admits that some guys will ignore you or say fuck off, but at least for him, the success rate is rather high.

Does this jibe with your experience? I want to believe him, but Im unsure about how often someone can do that safely without getting the authorities called on you.

For the straight or bi guys reading this, would you prefer someone to show you their mouth at a public gloryhole, so you know theres a cocksucker on the other side? Or would you prefer to initiate the usage of the gloryhole yourself by stroking yourself or tapping your foot?

One thing to consider is that due to the rarity of public gloryholes these days, a lot of younger guys dont know how to cruise or know that fingers in a gloryhole or foot tapping is to show interest. Ive realized this because Ive spoken to straight college guys who say that they would use a gloryhole, but they dont know the rules so to speak. Thats another reason why I think there is something promising about putting your mouth to the gloryhole. I just dont know how safe it is."

Meeting My Boyfriend For The First Time,Accomplished_Ant8671,ainbow,"Greetings everyone!

It's my first time posting here and I don't know how often do you guys come across such posts but, I just wanna share my achievement with you.

Last Thursday I've managed to meet my boyfriend whom I've been texting for over 2 months, we're both living in Egypt but in 2 different cities and yesterday I managed to come to him.

I wasn't even planning to do it - since there were many risks - I just did it and... It was magical, hugging him, holding his hands, feeling them in mine and staring into his eyes was a whole different feeling.
I just.. Can't describe how much i love him. He's the most adorable person i ever knew in my life and i'm so lucky i found him in a place like this.

I kept staring at his lips.. We really wanted to kiss. We tried to find a safe place but couldn't and in such a lethal country for homosexuals (Egypt) we were too anxious to do it. Def people are everywhere possible and if even anyone saw us holding hands.. We can be in huge trouble! 

It's been two months not a lot but.. It's been a life changing time. we made so many memories in chat. We both had our ups and downs in which we helped each other through. We wanted to make it real, we wanted to meet.. And we DID. we met, held hands and hugged..

Personally, I haven't heard before that other gay couples made it out of here, that's why we've promised each other that we'll stay together until we grow up and be able to escape that place together.

it will be a long journey, yes. But we are just in love! We want each other. 

Here's a photo we took right after meeting each other  *(I distorted our faces in order to stay anonymous and safe)*

"Im very confused about whether Im bi (thanks, HR)",haroldjacoby,ainbow,"I (M) have been married to my high school sweetheart (F) for over a decade. Were both each others only sexual partner and I am still madly in love with and *extraordinarily* attracted to her. We have a great sex life, though with a little less variety than early on. Im attracted to other women but have zero actual interest in any other woman. When I watch porn, my type, and handful of go-tos, are women who are basically my wifes (fit/petite) body double. Im a very, very happy and lucky guy. 

That said, Id pick MF (of MMF, or MMMF, or) over F solo or lesbian porn 100 times out of 100. I love blowjob vids, even if the girl is fully clothed. Every once in a while, Ill be in the mood for a vid of a guy jacking off, but only a very specific/athletic body type turns me on. I have zero interest in watching a guy fuck or go down on another guy, and I have no personal desire to fuck or get a blowjob from or get fucked by any guy, but in the abstract, I can totally imagine giving a blowjob to a guy whos my type. If my wife and I were ever to have a threesome (not gonna happen), Id rather tag team her with another guy (and probably help get him off) than have another girl join. 

I never gave a second thought to what my narrow/theoretical male attraction meant until the other day, when HR at my company invited employees to anonymously share their sexual orientation. I always thought of myself as straight, but as I hovered over the straight option, I couldnt help but wonder.. am I actually bi? If sexual orientation is a spectrum, how far from 0 or 100 does someone have to be before theyre not just straight or gay? It feels weird for a lifetime-monogamous guy in a passionate opposite-sex marriage to say Im bi because if I had to pick an Avenger to see nude, Id choose Chris Evans over Scarlett Johansson.

I want to talk about something today Im pretty sure I have talked about before, but we always have new people joining and questioning and I thought it was worth going back over again.

I want you to remember you are enough! We have people in the community always questioning whether they are enough. Am I bi  enough, Am I trans enough, am I lesbian enough, am I asexual enough, am I gay enough etc. The list could go on as we go through the letters in LGBTQIA+. I want you to remember you are enough if youre bi Youre bi enough. If youre transsexual youre transsexual enough in other words you pass there is no standard for what is female enough or what is male enough you know in your heart youre female or male and thats enough.

We need to stop letting society dictate how we should be. We need to stop listening to people who say oh your bi well you havent slept with the other sex so  how do you know.  We need to stop listening to them when they say oh you were born a male but you believe youre female well youll never pass. Its not about passing its about being true to yourself.

This holiday give yourself a gift and let that gift be being your authentic self. I know for some of you its tough with the situation as you live in but as you can be your authentic self. Remember my DMs are open if you need to chat.

**International Freedressing Awareness Day is an annual observance to bring much needed visibility to genderqueer and gender nonconforming folks as we are so frequently stigmatized in everyday society and even overshadowed in modern LGBTQ advocacy.**

I started Freedressing Awareness Day in response to the suicide of Frank Wolf, a popular YouTube vlogger and cosplayer who died in November 2013 as a result of cyberbullying. It is important that effeminate boys like Frank Wolf be accepted and respected in society, but also better represented and supported in queer spaces so that we can avert such tragedies in the future. Truth be told, gender nonconforming people have been active participants in the fight for queer liberation for 50 years -- and we've frequently been a catalyst for major social change, even in the LGBTQ community.

Needless to say, Freedressing Awareness Day isn't just about dressing up -- although that is a perfectly fine way to participate of course! This is also day to bring attention to issues such as depression and alienation that are often faced by genderqueer and gender nonconforming teenagers, as well as to recognize and celebrate gender diverse people in our lives. Nearly every other stripe of the rainbow has an official annual observance. *It's time to show the world just how beautiful we can be too!*"

"My Career is Keeping me in the Closet and at this point, I'm Just Tired",bigTittiedMothGF,ainbow,"Not sure what I'm looking to get from posting this, I just feel like voicing it to people who may understand. I'm a very career-oriented person, I'm in college working on my degree in a field that I'm very passionate about, and I feel lucky to have found it. Or at least, that's how I used to feel. I've known I was queer for a very long time, but since I grew up in a rural community, I looked forward to exploring more of my sexuality in college. I was looking forward to finding myself I guess. I never realized how hard accepting myself was going to be until I started dating people of the same sex. So I've been working on feeling comfortable with my own queerness and outwardly expressing it around my close friends. Now I find myself wanting to express it openly in general, dressing how I want, being seen in public with another man, ya know, being myself in public. But I've hit a roadblock. 

I don't know how I didn't see it before, but even though my uni is super queer-friendly, my major isn't. Most people in my field are very conservative and while I'm sure they wouldn't assault me or anything, they're not *that* homophobic, I'm sure that most of them would judge me or treat me differently. If I show up to class wearing something other than Levi's, boots, and a t-shirt I get sideways glances, weird looks, and just colder dispositions in general. But if I dress and act like them, it's all smiles and warm welcomes. I feel more ready to go out into the world and get closer to finding myself than I've ever been, but I fear if I do then I'll make things harder for myself than they already are. All the while, I feel a bit of guilt for not being authentic, because if I came out then maybe it'd make others in the major feel safe enough to do the same. 

It's so easy to get stuck in the closet since it's so comfortable. It's like trying to get out of bed on a cold morning. Sure it feels nice and warm and safe, but if you stay there all day you're just putting everything off until tomorrow. Ultimately, I still wanna do what I'm doing. I think I'm gonna like my career, just not my colleagues. Can anybody else relate?"

It was this weird speculative exercise where a bunch of people not part of the community debated the community's flaws and merits, while amplifying the spattering of voices from within the community that confirmed the outsiders' negative assumptions.

As more and more people realize they personally know someone who is trans or non-binary, I believe things will shift as they did for cisgender gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. There will be a new 'other' to repackage arguments for, and the 'othering' of trans / non-binary people will be relegated from the mainstream discussion to a subset of conservative discourse."
LGBT Sexual Wellness Products Have Been Difficult to Work With...,Reasonable_Try4492,ainbow,"This is my first post here, but it's a bit of a rant. I'm part of the LGBT community and I decided it would be a good idea to design and make some sexual wellness products for a people that suffer from a unique ""sexual"" problem that I do. The process was arduous and it took me months to design and begin manufacturing, but I'm getting there. When I try talking about my product on major social media platforms, my content is typically removed. It's a pain in the butt, but I really want to provide my product to people and see if they enjoy it and if it helps them with potential bedroom issues"

Supporting incarcerated LGBTQ folks this winter,lagomorpheme,ainbow,"Black &amp; Pink, a group that supports LGBTQ people incarcerated in the US, is asking for folks to print out their holiday cards, write a note, and send it to people on the inside. More information [here](https://blackandpinkpenpals.org/card-campaign/). Although B&amp;P has a penpal program, the idea here isn't for people to commit to a penpal relationship (they ask people not to take on more than two penpals at a time, whereas here they provide more than that), but instead to try to make sure that everyone gets a card.

I participated last year and am very glad I did. I sent around 40 cards. I provided my return address, and many people wrote back to express gratitude for receiving a letter. In most cases it was the only holiday letter they received.

I'm not officially affiliated with B&amp;P, but I correspond with some incarcerated people (and as mentioned I've participated in this event before). If anyone is interested in participating but has questions, let me know and I'd be happy to answer! (I also have access to a printer and can print cards and mail them to folks who have a PO box or are comfortable sending an address, just message me.)

Also, if you search ""Black &amp; Pink"" and your nearest major city on facebook, local chapters often host letter-writing events this time of year and there are still a lot doing so over zoom :)"

Meet the Unlucky,Professional-Gift685,ainbow,"Greetings, you can call me ""Gu"" and I have to get something off my chest. Just an warning, I'm not fluent in English so if something sounds weird please adjust, I'm using a translator sometimes but even the translator makes mistakes. 

I will tell you a story about me. (It's mostly about relationship, although it involves other areas I will try to focus on the relationship) I am 20 years old brazilian boy and now I feel very... Lost. 2020 was the worst year of my life. I was living only with my mother in Curitiba, we moved there at the end of 2018, and we loved every day there, later on 2020 because of the pandemic we have to move back to our home state. I had a dream to experience a dating, and I felt it was finally getting true. But then I have to move back. months later I learned that I was ""cheated"". he broke up with me to get back with his ex and move to portugal. he didn't tell me why I broke up and I only knew that because his friend told me (that in 2021 she betrayed my trust too) the relationship that was at a distance only lasted 2 weeks. I remember feeling like crap, my heart hurting so bad I hoped to sleep and not wake up anymore, I got so sick I literally couldn't eat, and I had my first anxiety attacks. I found out and realized that he treated me like garbage, it was toxic, and that left me with sequels to this day. These days I'm MUCH better than when this happened, (to put it mildly, this happened approximately about a year ago) I can see that him was bad for me and I feel great not having to deal with feeling uncertain. but every now and then there come memories that I had with him and didn't want to remember it. today I feel like I'm lost, I'm no longer in the state I wanted, in the city I wanted, I thought someone loved me, I was wrong. I feel that I have no direction. i feel like i have huge bad luck when it comes to love life, i know i'm only 20 but in that ""little"" time of life i've only witnessed the worst and bitterest part of relationships. I evolve every day, I try to fix my mistakes but at the same time I feel that if I could reset my life I would do it, I have very pessimistic thoughts about my future, I think the search for someone else's love has ended the little self-love That i had. Feels impossible to me to build my life but i feel if there was someone else i would. and I wanted to have the same willpower to do things for myself not for someone else.

Thats it, I tried my best to shorten the story and not talk about my other problems in other areas. I generally feel like I'm cursed for love and I think it's fucked up my life in general. Thank you for reading and feel free to comment anything. Hope you have a marvelous day."
"Has anyone debunked the claims that gay men are ""feminine"" and have ""lady brains"", and gay women are ""masculine"" and have ""manly brains""?",Mediocre-Fly-7587,ainbow,"There are many articles claiming that the brain of gay men is structured like the brain of women, and the brain of gay women is structured like the brain of men, as well as articles that claim gay men tend to be ""feminine"", and gay women tend to be ""masculine"": [https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2449185&amp;page=1](https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2449185&amp;page=1)

&gt;There is research that suggests gay men do prefer certain professions, like fashion, interior design and hair coloring, and that lesbians are more likely to prefer sports and the military. Researchers say it's because lesbians, on average, are attracted to more masculine occupations, and gay men tend to prefer more feminine occupations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Northwestern University psychology professor Michael Bailey has spent years studying human sexuality. He says sexual orientation makes gay men more feminine.  
&gt;  
&gt;""There's no obvious reason why sexual orientation should be associated with how masculine or feminine one is, but it is in our species. And it probably has to do with the causes of sexual orientation and early effects of hormones on the brain,"" Bailey said.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Gay men absolutely talk differently, on average. You can tell far better than chance who's a gay man from just listening to him say four sentences,"" Bailey said.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Denying stereotypes means that people have to disbelieve what is right there in front of their eyes. That can't be a good thing,"" Bailey said.

It's not just the brain, as you can see. There's apparently a gay way to talk ...

Clothing disaster,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family dad checking in on everyone hoping youre all good. Above all else remember I love you and youre valid. 

So I was looking for a Christmas sweater the other day for a Christmas party at work.   Ive lost a lot of weight and my old sweater is entirely to big. So I couldnt find anything at all in the mens section which you know I believe clothes have no gender but anyway. Having found nothing in mens I went over to ladies to see what they had. I was looking through their sweaters when a worker approached me and said sir thats a ladies sweater. I was willing to mind my tongue and simply asked ok wheres the mens sweaters. I was told real men dont wear sweaters. 

I was no longer willing to hold my tongue. I said since when does clothing define a real men or real women. Clothing is about style and comfort not male or female. I was so frustrated I did end up buying a ladies Christmas sweater for the party. 

Dont let people define who you are. Be yourself be unique be beautiful. My dms are always open if you need me.

Late to the party - Questions about PrEP,RabdyD1958,ainbow,"I guess I'm late to the party. I always have been.

I have known I liked the same sex sense I was only five years old. That is a different story. Let's just say I grew up in a very bad area, and in very bad times for being a homosexual boy. I fully understood that I was attracted to the same sex and I would not change before I was ten years old. I didn't Know the word gay for homosexuals. I had never heard it used that way. All I knew was the word homosexual, and a bunch of bad slurs used to hurt people like me.

Long before I was an adult I experienced just about every type of abuse, and hatred that many gay people have to go through. I decided it would be better to be alone than to live treated the way I had been treated, and saw how others like me were treated. I was unable to completely hide who I was all of the time.

It didn't get any better after I became an adult and joined the military. It got a lot worse. I had to hide who I was in order to survive. It continued to get worse after I was kicked out of the military when people found out I was a homosexual.

Then AIDS hit, big time. Hatred I saw grew. I was afraid to let anyone ever know who I really was. To top it off I felt that if I ever met someone I loved that could also love me, it would be a death sentence for both of us. So, I rarely peeked out of the closet, or had sexual activities with anyone.

I feared that if any coworkers, family, or friends knew who I was, they would reject me, and hate me. I stayed closeted until most of my relatives had passed away, including my parents. Nobody really knew me at all, until I was almost sixty.

Enough about being late to the party.

I finally decided that I just want to be myself for a change. I also decided that I did want to be as safe as possible with my health. I just did every  possible to protect myself and others, should I ever meet anyone I want to be with.

It got the COVID vaccine, and later the booster shot, along with every vaccine and medication I could think of. I got vaccines for COVID, Hep-A, Hep-B, Shingles, The flue, and pneumonia. I knew there was no possibility of me having any STD's. I just got tested for all of them including HIV. That is required to get the new medication I wanted to get a prescription for. Of course I tested negative for everything. If a person is not sexually active, he can't be positive for what I was tested for. But I felt that this one medication would allow me to attempt to finally try to date and meet someone nice.

Forgive me, I'm human, and I'm flawed, just like the rest of us. I want to have someone I can care about that also cares about me. I also want to be sexually active. Is that so much to ask for?

So, last night I took my first dose of Truvada, for PrEP. I will be sure to never miss a dose, and to keep up with required testing. I will probably use other protection as well, when, not if, I get sexually active.

Sorry, that was way too long of an introductory story to ask some simple questions. I don't know why, but I wanted to give a little background. So, here they are.

Can any of you that are taking PrEP, tell me about their experience with it? Have you had had side effects? Were they mild? Did any side effects last long, or did they relatively pass quickly? Are you happy with the decision to take Truvada, or a generic, or other medication for PrEP?

I think your answers will help me and others a lot.

Thanks in advance."
Some advice on name changes from someone who has done it....,ilovecatscatsloveme,ainbow,"Hi there!  I've been noticing a lot of posts lately across our rainbow of lgbtqia subs about name changes. ""What do I look like?"" or ""what should my name be?"" etc.

What I want to share is this: there is a bit of magic in changing your name. You don't have to believe me but a name is more than a name--and also a name is just a name! Isn't that mysterious?

Anyway, when you choose a name, one that you intend to stick with and probably legally adopt, consider the former part first. A name is more than a name. This means that whatever you've selected you will be entering into a relationship with what that name connotes. You might pick a name that makes everyone around you go ""huh?"" and then in a couple years people will say they can't possibly imagine you with any other name. Like a puppy with huge paws grows to match their paws, you will grow into your name. So pick wisely!

I know, I know, it's cliche to point this out. It's not even clear with a lot of names what you would be ""growing into"" since they are perhaps family names or arcane in some way. I ended up changing both my first and last names to my two grandmothers' maiden names--one of those being a family name that is foremost a name and not a thing or quality. But it has a quality! And these seven years I've become much more like this name than I would have ever guessed.

More than anything, changing your name is like a psychological life reset. That's why some people change their name a bunch of times--it's like getting a tattoo sort of, there's something exciting/risky/fun about it. You could *be anyone*! Change your name to x and people see you one way, then to y and people see you totally differently. It's magic!

See where I'm going with this? Use this magic to your advantage. Maybe you are thinking ""I just want a fucking name that gets me out of this whole Barbie/Ken thing and then be done with it."" The fact is a name will not do this unless you already embody it, and even then some people are not having it. You could choose the most stereotypical english men's name---""Scott"" or ""John"" and someone will turn it right back around into a woman's name, trust me they find a way. ""Oh!, this is Scott-Lyn!"" or ""Joslyn...what? Joooaaan? Jon? is that short for Joanne?"" The comp het impulse is stronger than you know. So don't go thinking a name will get you out of it.

The latter part: A name is just a name. Once you have chosen your name and told people, let it go! This is your name now, if people get it wrong that's on them. (And btw, when people first start calling you by your new name you may not respond--that's okay! It takes a while to get used to--and I still find myself responding to my old name then realizing there's no way that person knows me by that name, lol).  I didn't even bother to tell my parents or family when I changed my name. My given name was selected by them and let's just say they certainly weren't joining PFLAG when I came out to them as a teen--in fact they don't even know what PFLAG is or even that some people use neutral pronouns now. So I had super low expectations--they gave me a name, why would they accept that I am changing it? For thousands of years (or at least hundreds) parents have been naming their kids and most of them don't change it except for marriage or some cultural force that is less individualistic than ""I want a different name, and I'm changing it."" The people who named you are the least likely to be the ones jumping up and down about your new name, unless you are a very lucky person. As you go through life fewer and fewer people will know you by your old name. Pretty soon, within a year or two, only your family will know you by your dead name. For me, this was fine for a long time. It was kind of cool, like I go by one name out in the world and another with my family.

If you're looking for resources for names, I suggest literature/fiction. Unlike parents, authors often name their characters aptly because they already know their character. Traditional fairytales/folktales from whatever ethnicities you are is also a great place. You can find the modern versions of those older names still in use, too. Names of plants and trees, names of places you love, etc.

Consider how many syllables you want---they say two syllables is easier for people learn than one. As someone with a one syllable name that I love, I can say that in working with the elderly who are hard of hearing it is often more difficult.

Happy name hunting! "

Anal cancer among gay men,HakushiBestShaman,ainbow,"Hi all

This just popped up on my radar due to someone else's post where a troll mentioned it so I thought I'd share some info, no idea who needs to hear it. 

Anal cancer is heavily linked to HPV. The same as cervical cancer in women.

There is a vaccine for HPV that covers the 9 most common (or most likely to cause cancer) strains of HPV called Gardasil-9. Please get this if you can. 

I can't speak to the US but in Australia, local sexual health clinics specifically for gay men will likely be able to supply this free of charge. 

If you're in Perth, that's the M Clinic (I highly recommend them).

https://www.mclinic.org.au/

The vaccine has seen tremendous results in decreasing the rate of cervical cancer in women, so it's definitely a good idea. I know being gay men, medical treatment can be lacking at times, considering there was an ongoing initiative to give the HPV vaccine to all girls in high school in Australia. Though I believe that's changed to all students now.

Either way, if you can access it and haven't had it, go get it."
I have a lot of questions.,i_identify_as_purple,ainbow,"I'm not even sure where I should even be posting this. I'm also sorry for this account being new, I have an actual account that's pretty old but I also don't feel good about posting on there either.

I have this feeling, or fear really, that I won't ever get better unless I get actual answers. And I'm not exactly sure where to even start. I've gone through so much of my life with people telling me what I'm doing and how I'm feeling is completely normal, but nothing gets better.

I hate my body. I've always hated my body. I've never felt comfortable. I'm still waiting to grow to love it, but that seems to be like it's not happening. Kind of like how being bi was supposed to be a phase, but... I'm still bi. I like everyone, still. Except myself.

And it's not like I'm gross or ugly or something, at least to others, and I can only go off what I've been told, but I just don't see it. I've done quite a lot to try and grow to love it. I keep myself healthy, hydrated, I've kept myself thin, I've exercised, I've gained muscle and body tone, I've tried different clothing styles, I've tried yoga, I've tried different hair and facial hair styles. When does the loving start?

When I was a kid, I was short and stocky. For some reason, all my growth spurts got together and agreed to hold off for most of my childhood. And I was ridiculed for it. I mean, it's not like I liked it myself, but that didn't really help. So I pretty much kept to myself. Stayed quiet and tried to stay in the back. Until I was almost 17, then pow, huge growth spurt. It was during summer break, between sophomore and junior year. I was nearly 6ft now, thin, toned body and abs. I really hadn't paid it much thought really. It didn't make me feel better or anything until I went to school, first-day junior year. To me, I was still just me, so it hadn't really crossed my mind that I've changed. Wen't walking through school the first day, and I was getting looks. Good looks. Girls looking at me, boys looking at me. Felt a little good for a moment. Was very short-lived. These people teased and mocked me for the longest time, so it wasn't like I was about to be friendly all of a sudden with them, and they knew that. But what they didn't know, was that that was me walking through the school. I had so many people come up and ask about me, and who are you, are you new, did you just transfer? Uh, no, it's... me. Then, instantly back to the way it was. That... felt terrible.

That proceeded with nearly a decade of me bathing with the bathroom lights turned off. Parents sent me to shinks who told me that I was just normal, and eventually I'd grow to love and accept myself. I was put on meds that just doped me up and numbed me. And I liked it, being numb. And that felt bad. I also started getting severe panic attacks. The first one happened at school... during gym... in the locker room... It apparently looked as if I was seizing, because the school just called an ambulance that came and tranqed me. Woke up several hours later in the hospital stoned on tranqs. The best part of school was the woodworking class I took that had a buffer in the shop, and I'd use it to polish my nails. I'd paint my nails before that class, then buff them there. Best looking nails I've ever had. How do I do that now? I kind of miss those.

At least I didn't really start developing body hair really til my early 20s. I hate it. So much. The only reason I have a beard is because it covers my face. Lockdown at least gave me to excuse to literally walk out of my house with a mask on every day, even where it's not mandated, I have a mask on. Actually, I cover up my head as much as I can. Beard, glasses, beanie, hat, hood, any and everything to cover it. I hate being naked, you will never find me even remotely close unless I'm jumping in the shower. The closest I'll get is basketball shorts, and only within my house. If I leave the house, hoodie and baggy pants. I love swimming, but I never do it because I'd have to take off my shirt, and I don't even do that in my own house really. And some scrawny tall dude swimming with a t-shirt just looks weird and I don't want attention. I hate pictures being taken of me. I don't even really have pictures of myself. I've been talking with someone recently, and I wanted to show them a pic of me younger, but I don't really have any. My parents have pics of me as a child, and the oldest pic I have of myself is from this year. I'm in my 30s. There's like a 20+yr gap of photos I just don't have because of my insecurities. Is that even normal? The idea of someone taking my photo makes me recoil. It shouldn't, should it? I've been trying to take photos recently due to this realization, and I do not like it.

Why do I feel this way? Why do I hate my body so much? Aren't I suppose to be happy or comfortable with my body? Why did so many people tell me this is normal and fine?"

Are we close Friends or is she flirting with me?,matichole,ainbow,"So there's this girl, we've known each other for 3 years now. (I liked her for a long time and she knows I'm pan.) Since we are not in the same school anymore and she is very busy we don't see each other so often. But yesterday we and a couple of my Friends met. Because we didn't see each other for months I forgot how sheakes me feel, despite the long break we immidiatley started and laughing, it was the Best feeling ever.
As the evening progressed she laughed at my jokes, leaned on me, put her hand on my knee a couple of times and jokingly asked me to be her wife (not for the first time). But the problem is she calls most close friends her wifes. I am so lost and I don't want to ask her about her true feelings, because she is just too important to me and I wouldn't risk our friendship. If we ever got together I would be very happy but if she stayed my friend this is all I need, because I just want her in my life.

Are homoromantic men one of the most tragic minorites of the LGBT+?,throwaway059304a,ainbow,"I mean i kinda feel bad for them, they have no one else to relate to.  
They can't relate to gay or bi men because they generally just like dick and nothing else, something homoromantic men can't usually relate to.

Holidays are tough,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey gang dad checking in wishing all of you a happy thanksgiving and reminding you you are loved. 

I know today is going to be hard for a lot of you for many different reasons. For one Its hard to have to be with family and be able to be yourself. Whether youre trans and have to present as your agab or you have to pretend to hetero and hide who you love. Its going to feel overwhelming but just know youre not alone myself and others are here to help if you need to reach out. 

Another reason some of you are stressing is youve decided to come out today as most of the family will be together. Even though youve thought about what to say and what the reaction may be and you know youre ready its still nerve racking. I have often heard people say that even though they know theyll be accepted they were still scared. Coming out even in the best of circumstances is still scary. You are taking a huge step in your life and even positive steps can be scary. Im here rooting you on just know that. Youve got this and today you will be able to be your true self. 

The holiday season is tough for lgbtqia people because we either have to hide who we are or weve already came out and are not welcome to attend family gatherings. Whatever the case Im here. My dms are open if you need to talk

I'm a genderfluid hermaphrodite and my pronouns are They // Its. For some reason, my friend calls me a ""she"" when I clearly stated that I don't want to be called a ""she"", due to past trauma. My friend said that he respected that, but kept on calling me a she. I told him many times, but he just dismisses it as ""I always saw you as a she"", ""You're too femenine, even your voice is femenine"" or ""Your PFP is too femenine, it confuses me"". I've even cried because of this. Today, my friend we're talking about here who we'll call 'Friend 1', and 'Friend 2' were in a voice call with me today. Friend 2 was very respectful about my pronouns and corrected himself after accidentally calling me a ""she"", but upon hearing Friend 1 was calling me a ""she"" he started calling me a ""she"" too. The call is over right now, and I'm seriously questioning myself. Am I really a ""she""? Am I just being a whiny crybaby? I don't want to unfriend them because they're my childhood best friends...I don't know what to do."

I'm conflicted,SimplyafanofJisoo,ainbow,"     So a year ago I come out as Lesbian and shortly after I fell in love with my best friend. I asked her out and she said yes.

     So a couple of months ago She wanted to break up with me, but she still  wanted to be friends with me. At first I was shocked because to my our relationship was going really smooth and healthy. Plus I still had feelings for her. Since she was always there for me. She the first person I told about my abusive shitty family and she have me a lot of  comfort during those times. When I first was diagnosed with depression and anxiety she was the first person I told. When there was any issue with my life she was the first person I would tell and she was always there for me. And I didn't want to break up with her. But I did it  anyway since she was longer attracted to me and I didn't want to loose our friendship.

   And to this day I still have feelings for her. It's so obvious that she's no longer attracted to me and has moved on. For some reason I can't do the same thing. I not attracted to anyone else, but her and feel so dumb about it. I don't want to move on since I don't think I'm ready, but and same time I don't want to cling on to the past. I honestly so conflicted."

"Transgender Awareness Week happens every year before Transgender Day of Remembrance, held every November 20. TDOR commemorates all the trans individuals worldwide lost to violence. Step up, be up &amp; bring everybody with you.",TaylorLakhryst,ainbow,"2021 gets recognized as the most violent year on record against transgender individuals worldwide, highlighted by an **over 7% increase** of homicides against transgender individuals compared to the previous record year, 2020.

In Canada, **for every one transgender person, there are at least twenty Canadians who actively support anti-transgender beliefs**. Standing around ""not being transphobic"" is as helpful as being invisible againstthat ratio.

Energy 106 FM (Evanov Communications) enabled a safe space for transphobia and white nationalism. They consistently ignored calls for action from the transgender community to denounce anti-transgender hate from supporters who promote their brand and hosts while simultaneously attackingtransgender individuals. Elected officials in Winnipeg &amp; Manitoba allow it to persist by not continually being firm that bigotry and hate are not welcome in our communities. WPS &amp; RCMP do not seriously take continued threats, harassment and incitement of violence amplified by Energy &amp; Evanov's supporters to the transgender community. Community services, media, platforms and prominent voices who can speak up against hate continue to stay silent.

**Hate will not stop unless people act to stop the hate.**

In less than one minute, you can make your voice heard to demand ending this hate by visiting this call to action: [**Click here. Demand better. End trans erasure. Stop anti-trans platforming &amp; enablement of violence.**](https://act.newmode.net/action/hirewheller/csr) **Name. Email. Postal/Zip. Send. Done.**

Each year, from November 13  19, people and organizations participate globally in Transgender Awareness Week to raise the visibility of transgenderindividuals and address issues the community faces. Transgender Awareness Week is a week when transgender individuals and their allies bring attention to the community by educating the public about who transgender individuals are, sharing stories and experiences and advancing advocacy around the issues of prejudice, discrimination and violence affecting the transgender community.

**Transadvocate Gwendolyn Ann Smith founded Transgender Day of Remembrance as a vigil to honour her memory of Rita Hester, a transgender woman who got killed in 1998. The vigil commemorated all the transgender individuals lost to violence that year and began a memorial performed every year since then. Transgender Day of Remembrance occurs every year on November 20.**

[Watch the final segment of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYnwIlnQ1e0&amp;t=5985s) to see how you can help end the increase of anti-transgender violence. It's a 20-to-1 battle of survival for every transgender Canadian right now.**Step up, be up &amp; bring everybody with you.**

P.S, my friend is not allowed on Reddit, but she wanted me to share this, and so she sent me a pic of the note and told me to tell to you guys. Also, she was already out to her sister and parents since march of 2018, and so she has already updated her wardrobe, pronouns, and name. P.S, she always had long hair, and so that never needed to be changed. Also, she came out to her Aunt 3 weeks ago, but the package just arrived this Tuesday according to my friend.

wondering how prevelant does exclusion really seem to be?,gaijin_lolita,ainbow,"I see so much exusion by terfs (so much ) and aphobes, so I know that those are pretty bad and definately a problem existing (obviously not a huge part of the community but still a big issue) in the community, but im spefically wondering how prevelant exclusion of other groups seems to be? 

because I see alot of hate towards people with orientations that are straight/het in some way but also queer (rather gender romantic or sexually), fluid, flexible, or fall under split attraction, and Im just not sure if thats how alot of the community feels or if its just the frindge group of people hating on others who do that with everyone. like Im hoping its just the case that its just eclusionist activly hate more then people activly support so it looks worse then it is. 

also it seems alot of exclusion coming from beliefs of ""your orientation and experiences are illrelvant"" ""well I thought I was that identity, but I wasn't I was missundering my feelings, and since I wasnt it harmed me therefore that whole group is bad/will grow out of it!"" or ""thats so harmful! youll confuse the uneducated and theyll assume something about us. you should just not talk about that experience or say your something else you dont really fit into."" which is just so hard to fight against and I see get applied so universally to queer people which just sucks :( 

I really am not sure if its still a common belief or if most people have grown out of that type of exclusionist narrow view of orientation. so I guess I just wanna get the opinion of others on where most people think the community stands?"

To make things clear he crossdresses but not as in like a ""fetish"" kind of way that some people consider them to be. He just likes having an everyday feminine appearance, including workouts so he could have the "" feminine figure"" (but wants to keep a flat chest) too as well as  ""feminine  personality"". Although he has never tried it, he wants to put on make up and other cosmetics too some time in the near future . Please answer as honest as you can  because he is considering to join a university club that supports whatever group of the LGBTQ  he is associated with and does not want to embarrass himself if none of them is willing to welcome him.  Again, don't worry about hurting his feelings, he is completely fine with being the odd one out and keeping his cross dressing  a secret to family and friends (but still dress in public of course)  Trust me, he's been through a lot in high-school so nothing anyone says  can  seriously hurt him at this point. I apologize if I wrote too much or someone has recently asked a similar question. Thank you for your time!"

First and foremost, I want to give a HUGE THANK YOU to everyone who showed me so much support on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/qvx6tu/muscle_maid_wants_you_to_play_with_gender_in_a/). This was my first post on this subreddit and I didn't think it would do as well as it did, so THANK YOU x 10000 &lt;3 I hope my post was as empowering as your comments empowered me to continue to express myself.

I now, however, come to you again on a somewhat more serious note. Three days ago, I turned 25 (Nov.15th), and the day after my birthday, I went to the doctor to see about a cold I've been having for a while (if you've seen me on stream, you've probably noticed me coughing and sneezing). Well it turns out I tested positive for COVID. I am fully vaccinated and consider myself a pretty cautious person, so this was a surprise. Luckily the symptoms have been mostly mild and I'm feeling better as the days progress, but I'm continuing to quarantine abiding by CDC guidelines. Unfortunately, since testing positive, I have been unable to work (I work in restaurants) and I was really banking on this and next week's paychecks to cover rent next month. As I mentioned before, I do stream on Twitch ( [https://www.twitch.tv/sunduwubu](https://www.twitch.tv/sunduwubu) ), but I'm still very new and I haven't made any sizable income off it yet. I have maybe a third of my total rent so if I could just get a small push from the community, I think I'd be able to make it.

I feel extremely paltry for asking for help on Reddit, but I hope by asking for your support on my Twitch channel at the very least I can provide a service for your help-- the service being entertainment as I squeal and scream at video games that I'm bad at. If you'd like to support me directly, please DM me.

Transgender child facing conversion situation over mother's objections,Tough-Rise1578,ainbow,"I have been shockingly blind-sided by the family court in Florida, regarding my transgender child.  
I am facing a situation that I wouldve thought impossible in this day and age.  
Everybody keeps saying that this shouldnt happen and that shouldnt be possible.  
But it is happening.

**My ex-girlfriend has been given parental decision making for my child, because my child is transgender, and she wants to try to convert her into not being transgender. My exs aim is for me to be given supervised visitation, only, because I respect my childs right to self determination and allow my child to choose her own presentation.** 

My child is 12 years old, and began asking to present as female at 3. She has been socially transitioned with me for years.

At the most recent hearing, my ex introduced no evidence that I was abusive or causing my child to be transgender. No witnesses were called. No evidence was admitted at all, other than our respective testimony and that of the two doctors, neither of which had screened my child for gender dysphoria or gender identity.

In the ruling, which I got Friday, Nov. 5, 2021, the judge ignored my expert witness testimony. He gave my ex-girlfriend educational and medical parental decision making. He changed my childs school district to where my ex lives.

My ex is currently considering which private school to put my child in, as her birth gender, and I strongly suspect that it will be conservative parochial and unaccepting. My child has been socially transitioned with me for years.

My ex has now filed two more motions with the court, asking that I be given supervised visitation. She is advocating for my child to be treated by someone who will somehow make her not transgender.

The legal experts I have consulted with agree that the would be turned over by the appeal court and that this is a terrible precedent for all parents of transgender children.However, I am on Social Security Disability and my means to appeal this are very limited.

All I know to do is to reach out to the community and beg for suggestions to help my child be ok. I am open to any suggestions or feedback.

For tonight, at least, my child sleeps without knowing what is coming. Someone suggested the Reddit community might be able to help. All I know to do is send out this note in a bottle on the Internet, and pray for help."

Such a small dating pool?!,Revolutionary-Duck62,ainbow,"I live in a major city but I'm surprised by how small the dating pool is when it comes to queer wom\*n!!

So I met a girl on a dating app, and we talked online for quite some time as we had a lockdown period due to Covid, and couldn't physically meet. She seemed cool so I asked her out as soon as health regulations allowed. She complained about travelling to my suggested activity (I'm talking a 40 min train ride max.), and changed the date once or twice to accommodate public transport. We live on the outer suburbs of our city, and she said something about not wanting to go into town, so I changed the venue and everything... I was kind of put off by her attitude, it gave me the impression she wasn't that interested or she was flakey. But, OK, we go out. She spends 80% of the time whinging about her job, and again, this didn't impress me but I thought, we're all learning how to socialise again after lockdown so we agreed to meet again. 

Second date, she cancels last minute saying she has period cramps. I was not happy by this point. If she hadn't messed me around the first time, I would have let it go. She asked to see me the next day, but I needed to think on it so I just said I was busy with other stuff. I thought about it and reflected it wasn't going anywhere if I already felt annoyed by her. She kept messaging me though, so I messaged her to say 'I've got too much going on right now' as a way to kind of wrap things up politely. She didn't seem to get that and replied to me like, ""oh what's up?"" I stopped messaging her at that point. I didn't want to ghost, but I had tried to politely wrap it up and it didn't go to plan so my brain was just like ""can't deal with this"", if that makes sense. I only just started dating again after very many years, and you could say my communication skills are rusty. 

Anyway, so this LGBT event is coming up that I was looking forward to, and guess who I see on the guest list? Yep, it's her. I'm not sure what to do- to message her first, and kind of break that ice so it's less awkward tomorrow? Or go, and hope she doesn't show up? But if she does, go say 'hi' quickly and then go back to friends? it's so awkward. I'm opting towards 'not go'!"

TW: Help With Dating Moving Forward,askgirlthrowaway,ainbow,"Hi, I'm using a throwaway because I am using personal information. Trigger warning: SA. Really need some advice from the community on how to work through an issue. This has gotten auto removed on lesbian subs and I have no idea why, I'm looking for support. Sorry if I ramble I have a hell of a time being succinct.

I've (29f) been seeing a new therapist for about 7 months now who I really love, and I have a psychiatrist for my med management. I'm autistic and have C-PTSD from a lot of things, not just SA. Had a lot of shit in my life. I've done a lot of therapy over the years because obviously I hella need it. But recently had a major depressive episode of over a year, moved, and needed new mental health care.

I've never really worked through my sexual assault history intensely before cause I've mostly managed OK but I am now since we've covered the main issues and I've been doing really well. There was something that I struggle with from about a year and a half ago that I just couldn't really tell my therapist about because... She's not queer? And quite old. And I really think I need like, a more informed opinion from the queer community.

I've been completely out as a lesbian since I was 13. My previous history with SA was a babysitter for about a year, being stalked by a man in college who even took photos of the inside of my house about a year and became extremely invasive into my dating life, and getting raped while drinking with a guy ""friend"" (definitely didn't turn out to be one). 

About two years after that incident I was newly single from a long term relationship and getting back out there with casual dating. Having fun going out on dates, often hooking up, etc. Wasn't abnormal for me to sleep with someone on the first date, I was clear about being casual, and sexual intimacy and compatibility is important to me as it takes time for me to develop romantic attraction.

So I meet this woman on tinder and liked chatting with her so we went out on a date. Had fun out for a few hours then went back to her place to hang out. Hanging out turned into more as it does and we were making out. She takes my hand while we're kissing and just. Puts it on her penis, which is suddenly there and out. Mind, the last time I saw one I got anally raped by a ""friend"" and I just kinda froze. 

Cause I didn't know? It wasn't in her profile that she was trans and we never talked about it. If she had I would have needed more... Time? To deal with that I guess and definitely not on the first date or in casual encounters. So I was in my head trying to figure out what to do because I was terrified of upsetting her or making her feel bad about herself and I pretty much just disassociated and let it happen. She was inside me and everything (did not check in ever in the situation despite me not moving, ask about penetration, did not use or offer a condom, I was surprised and honestly so disassociated from the moment that I didn't think about pregnancy risks as it was a situation I've never encountered before). I hit complete decision paralysis and couldn't do anything and it just got worse because I felt like there was no point I could feasibly stop it without coming off as... 

Transphobic? And I didn't want to cause a scene or to have to suddenly stop and have to dump my huge load of mental trauma on someone who was just going to feel terrible if I tried to explain. She never stopped or checked in or anything verbally, even when I didn't move. I mean I did tell her I was a mega bottom but like, I thought at some point she might check in or something and it never happened.

So I've been struggling with this like. In my head it's a painful memory. I stopped dating for a bit sometime after. I just don't know what to do if I'm ready to start dating again because I don't want to be grilling people about their equipment or having to deal with the same situation if they never tell me? And I don't just want to try and ""guess"" if a woman is trans? And like, did this girl have a responsibility to disclose at some point or was I the one who should have spoken up? I just don't know how to have that communication happen because that situation just felt wrong but I'm worried that it's me, and that if I can't speak up in a situation like that then I shouldn't be dating? I feel ready to though, and my therapist thought so but I think she was looking at it like, I've never had an issue being sexually intimate with women and my history is with men. I didn't know that I would have that severe of a reaction to a penis. But like, I think it would be a long thing and dependent on the relationship for me to get to a point where I'm comfortable with a penis like that. I wish I had better control of my brain but I just don't right now. I'm fine taking the longer route if I like someone but that would require a conversation ahead of time? Also doesn't feel fair to other people to waste their time when honestly, I have no idea how long it would take to develop the trust/work through the issue with a specific partner.

I've talked to a lot of my trans friends and there's mixed opinions on the issue. Most consider it SA. When I asked on a trans sub some people said it wasn't SA, some said I shouldn't be hooking up with people. Some said she never had any responsibility to tell me. Some said I should put ""genital preference for vaginas"" on my bio. One said I should ask every woman I go out with what their genitalia was (which seems pretty rude...)

My considerations for the situation are that - she may have not assumed a pregnancy risk with HRT, maybe assumed most women use BC, maybe she didn't think it through, maybe she forgot to put it on her profile. Lots of maybes. I hold her no ill will, just told her I wasn't available to meet up again when she texted me later. 


So I guess I'm asking for help in the community identifying what went wrong and how to not get into a situation like that again where it goes so fast that I disassociate. Please help? I don't really know how to approach this and it's such a sensitive issue. Obviously I plan to continue working with my therapist but I need some input from the queer community as I feel like this is such a nuanced situation."

Is my teammate biphobic?,acatunderthebridge,ainbow,"My (20F) teammate (20F) is a lesbian. Recently, I opened up to her about struggling with my sexual identity because I thought that she would be an impartial 3rd party (I have a boyfriend and most of my other friends really love him so I cant trust them to be impartial). Since then she has been making jokes that I need to just break up with my boyfriend and realize that Im just a lesbian. This weekend she made a joke in front of someone that I dont even really know. She said something to the effect of just admit youre gay because I was talking to her about The L word and a movie I found that we could watch together that was LGBTQ+. I said I am gay because even though I identify as bisexual, I will just call myself gay. She said you cant be gay and dating a man so I said bisexual people exist and I am one of them. She then said bisexual girls are just gay but they find one guy they like and marry them. I keep just brushing it off because I dont like confrontation. I told my roommate/other teammate (20F) who is an ally and she said that I need to call her out. Was her comment really biphobic? If so how do I handle talking to her because she tends to get extremely defensive? 

Im sorry this post is so long and probably confusing.

Edit: when she realized she was attracted to women, I helped her through it (she was dating a man at the time). Originally she thought she was bisexual, but then realized she was just a lesbian. Do yall think this may contribute to how she feels about me being bisexual?"

Please don't try suicide.,roger01011,ainbow,"Hello. Quick little story to tell. I hope anybody that's depressed are considering suicide. Take a moment to read this it's 100% true.
Between 1937 and 2012, an estimated1,400 bodieswere recovered of people who had jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, located in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States.
This is just the bodies that were recovered.

Now on to the story. I grew up partially in San Francisco. My father was a staunch advocate of putting the suicide barrier up on the bridge. He would walk with the sign just about every day. Asking for the barrier.
They say 1,400 bodies were recovered. What that story doesn't tell is that a lot of people jumped at night. That nobody saw. Or in fog or rain. So their bodies were never recovered. They figure the total is about twice of that. But anyway five people. When I heard this story. Had survived jumping off the bridge. There was a psychiatrist at UC Berkeley. Who wanted to understand. So he went and interviewed all five survivors. He asked all five the same question.

What is the first thing you thought of when you jumped?

All five every single one of them said the same thing.

They all thought of the solution. They figured out what the problem was and how to fix it. That's five out of five. That had regret for jumping. How many of that 1400 have that same epiphany after jumping? I bet it was quite a few of them. There's always a solution. It may be an uphill climb it may be hard. But life is hard. But life is also wonderful. There's always someone there to listen. Whether you go to a suicide helpline. If you're a teenager there's teenage help lines. Military there's military helpline. There's people me for one. More than willing to listen. More than willing to try to help you work out the problem. Please before you make that decision that can't be unmade. Talk to someone. This world is a wonderful place. It can have shitty people in it. It can have hardness and coldness in it. But there's also a huge amount of beauty. Look at a newborn baby look at a puppy look at a field of flowers. There's so much beauty around you. When you're depressed and you hyper focus on the negativity it's hard to see that. Let someone else help you. They really will. If nobody's told you before. Or recently. I love you. You're wonderful person. Let someone help you work this out."

Biphobia is deeply illogical,PresidentJoeManchin,ainbow,"Most cishet dudes (who by definition aren't attracted to dicks) don't feel grossed out by the knowledge that their girlfriend fucked a few penis-having dudes in the past. (though because of slut shaming, there's always an arbitrary number that's considered ""too high""). 

Likewise, most cishet women (who by definition aren't attracted to vulvas or vaginas) aren't grossed out by the knowledge that their male partners stuck their penises into other vagina-having women in the past.

But for some reason, there are some gay men and lesbian women out there that feel grossed out at the knowledge that their bi partner has slept with people of the opposite sex in the past. For example, a lesbian women is uncomfortable or grossed out that her bi girlfriend fucked dudes in the past, or a gay man is grossed out that his bi boyfriend has had sex with women in the past (I'm emphasizing ""in the past"" because biphobes really care about past relationships of bi people for whatever reason). 

STD testing exists, condoms exist, showering and hygiene exists. If you're an STD-free person and you fuck another STD-free person, you aren't tainted by that person for life or some shit. You don't get magical sex cooties from them. But there are some lesbians out there who think bi women have been tainted by those icky penises, and there are some gay men who think bi men have been tainted by those icky vaginas. 

There's also the stereotype of bi people being promiscuous cheaters, a stereotype with literally zero evidence to back it up. Nothing but anecdotes. Gay people and straight people can also be promiscuous and also cheat, and they often are and often do.

Biphobia is deeply, deeply illogical."

I am afraid that even if they accept me they would treat/look at me differently. And only two of my closest friends know about it. And there are girls in my class/school who are attracted to girls it just that they are JUST attracted to them. They want to hookup and that's it. They don't want a relationship or anything serious.

And I don't know if there are other people who think like me. There must be other people like me. I just feel so alone. I feel like a freak for thinking like that. Because I never met with another person who thinks like me. I just feel alone. And no one can understand it, not even my friends because they don't feel/think like me. I just want to know that there are people like me."

I don't understand biphobia,PresidentJoeManchin,ainbow,"Straight cis guy here, not sure if I'm allowed to post here. I acknowledge my perspective might be biased, but I want to learn from the community.

I've heard stories (mostly from LGBT people and bi people themselves) that some gay people don't like sleeping with bi people because they feel bi people are sort of ""tainted"" by sleeping with the opposite sex. Like maybe you're a gay man, and you feel uncomfortable that a bi male partner had sex with women in the past. Same with lesbians dating bi women. How common is this attitude in the community? Was it more common in the past? This is weird to me because most straight people aren't really grossed out by their partner having had sex with men/women in the past, unless they're weird religious types who think premarital sex ""taints"" you as a person, but the latter is a minority. I'm a guy who doesn't like penis, but I'm not grossed out by the idea that my girlfriend has had sex with other men in the past. And likewise she (who is straight) doesn't care that I've had sex with women in the past. I think most straight people don't care. 

Also, because bi people tend to assimilate easier into straight culture or can easily pass, it seems to me like some gay people sort of view bi people as being like sleeper agents for The Straights, if that makes sense. I guess *maybe* I can understand why there might be some resentment there, but I still think that's really dumb and bigoted. People who are homophobic don't make the distinction and hate bi people just as much, since in their small minds gay people and bi people are just ""the gays"" or ""the q*****"".

There's also the promiscuous/cheating bi stereotype which I think is such a cruel and dumb stereotype, because straight people and gay people also cheat and are just as promiscuous. Who comes up with this stuff?"
Gay men are manlier than straight men,PresidentJoeManchin,ainbow,"It's simple math:

Straight couples are 50% male

Gay couples are 100% male

Trans Love ,LGBTCrimeBoss,ainbow, 
Are all men going to patronize me? Forever?? Having trouble with my partner,tallsmall96,ainbow,"Hi there! I'm 20, NB, and I've been dating this man (27M) for over a year. Usually we get along really well, but occasionally he'll say something patronizing that makes me feel stupid. I know this is partly because he's a few years older, but him being a man definitely contributes to it. Of course, mansplaining is a well-known phenomenon. 

Tonight, we were listening to this disco song, and I made some comment about how it was unfortunate that the song was made by a white person, since Black people pioneered that genre. My partner went off on a tirade to the tune of ""if no one was allowed to imitate other artists, we would never have new music"" and ""I just want to be able to enjoy this song without thinking about racism."" We are both white. It made me really uncomfortable to hear him say these things, and I told him so. I felt that he was calling me overly sensitive, when all I did was make a passing comment about how Black artists get copied by white people. I don't know why he kept trying to explain why there was nothing wrong with the song, even though he ultimately admitted I was right. I feel that he picked a fight just because I made him think about racism.

Another thing: My partner doesn't like to be called cishet because he's been attracted to men in the past, and because he doesn't identify with cis men. But he also won't call himself queer, because he thinks it's ""stealing valor."" Since he's never had sex with/'dated a man, and he doesn't identify as trans or NB, he doesn't feel like he has the right to claim the LGBTQ label. I don't want to force him to come out or to claim a label that he's not comfortable with, but I also am uncomfortable that he's not willing to own his identity or explore his sexuality/gender. I want to help him be more comfortable with himself, and I've tried to tell him that he should embrace his queerness, but I don't know if there's much else I can do. 

I really do love my partner and we're trying to work through these issues. We have so many good times together, and he's helped me grow in so many ways. As with any Reddit post asking for relationship advice, you're only seeing the bad parts of him, and I have many flaws too. But there's only so many times I can tell him that he's patronizing me and making me feel dumb. I don't ever want to feel that way with my partner. 

So I guess my question is: Are all men just gonna explain shit to me that I already know? Pick fights for no reason? Does every woman deal with this when dating a man? Can we talk through these problems? Or is dating men just a mistake?

TLDR: My partner sometimes says patronizing shit that makes me feel stupid. He also won't own his queerness. Can we work through this with better communication?"

Falling in love with friends,12TheShadow12,ainbow,"I (m16) have an issue where I am interested in my friend (m16), but Idk if he likes me back or not. He is doing things to me that he wouldnt do to others, like pushing me down on a table and other things too, not sexually, just joking in that way. But also he is talking about girls a lot so I assumed he was straight, but he keeps talking like he isnt. Like: I like that doll (like an anatomy model) cuz it has both boobs and balls, and imagine wanting to have a gf. But when people say anything about that we should be more than friends, (ppl r shipping us), he gets all uncomfortable and defensive. I know he also liked or likes Idk a girl. I mean Ik I cant change someones sexuality, but at the same time I want him to like me. The way he acts is also confusing me since I really enjoy our friendship and Ik it can sound like he uses me which I hope he doesnt, but Idk if I am ready to leave him if he would rn. 

I also find it hard to see the difference between platonic and romantic, cuz I often fall in love e my closest guy fiends, doesnt have many male onces)

Ignorant as I am I say 'so they're bi?'. No disrespect meant, I was simply processing why/how they'd be with him. He looked at me as if I said soemething completely innapropriate and explained they made an exemption for him, but identify as lesbian and I shouldnt say they're bi. I don't know them and didn't try to correct them on how they felt. He felt special for being the exception so many times, but said he struggled with the fact his partners wouldn't be attracted to him.

But now I wanted to know, anyone else here made 'an exception'? And if so, how can you have a healthy relationship when your not attracted to your SO?"

Gay (male) spaces not being POC friendly,LegDangerous5141,ainbow,"So I stumbled upon [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/qpb9bl/first_time_being_with_a_black_daddy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) titled ""my first time with a Black daddy"" and was thrown a bit off guard. Idk how many times POC have to speak on how dehumanising it is to be constantly relegated to your race and sensationalised for it alone. Whether that's ""cute, asian, submissive"" or ""beefcake, black, barbarian top"", this type of fetishising is basically the animalisation of an entire race, just because it's been normalised amongst gay porn sites doesn't detract from the fact that it's grossly problematic.

So myself and another Redditor politely try to inform the OP of the how the post is offensive and are met with such vitriol.

Not only that, but we're also downvoted which shows we don't have the support/ally of other gay redditors. I tried to report the malicious comment but the mods haven't done anything about it (please mass report).

This got me thinking about the general apathy and even hostility towards POC in male gay spaces whenever we bring up our issues in relation to gay culture. I can't quite understand why gay men could suffer from such a lack of empathy considering that we ourselves are a targeted and often grossly stereotyped group who are commonly used as the butt of jokes, described as crimes against nature or even as mentally deranged.

The reason I use ""male/men"" is because POC lesbians that I've talked to don't face these issues or seem to ever recognise them in their community, only other queer POC men that I've discussed with have experienced this kind of insensitivity/ blatant racism from their own community."

I want you to remember that I do love you I do support you in all that you do and I want you to know that regardless of where you are in the lgbtqia community you are indeed valid. Normally I don't make posts like this but this has gotten under my skin to the point that I've just got to vent a little bit. I talked to a jackass today who told me that people in the lgbtqia community could not claim to be born that way because there is no gene to determine whether you're gay you're or bi or lesbian or whatever. And I chilled for a little bit before I responded to him mainly because I didn't want to just fly off the handle but I wanted to be sure I chose my words carefully and correctly. And after thinking about it for a while I responded to him this way so what kind of personality would you say you have? He said well I would say I'm out going okay sir what would you say you enjoy doing oh I love fishing okay thank you. Can you do me a favor sir? He said I don't know what is it I said can you do a blood sample and show me where the gene for outgoing Personalities or the gene for wanting to go fishing and things like that are. Oh he said there are no genes for those I said okay well do this for me then so that we can kind of get to your point do your blood work and show me where the gene is that says you're straight. He responded with I don't have to show you the straight gene your straight by default. I said really because if you're going to argue that there's a gay gene for instance there also must then be a straight gene you can't have one without the other it's like a Christian trying to tell you that hell exists without heaven or vice versa. He said well that's not true science doesn't have to prove you're straight you have to prove your gay. I think by this point you're beginning to see that the conversation was fruitless. Folks remember you are valid Just the Way You Are and you can be born a certain way without having a gene for that particular thing yes your genes determine whether or not you have blue eyes blonde hair how tall you are whether you're predisposed to certain diseases and things like that but there are no genes to determine who you love there are no genes to determine what your personality is going to be like or anything like that. It is so sad that there is such an ignorance in the world that they're so homophobic they have to come up with an argument like well there has to be a gay gene if you're going to claim to be gay excetera. No why can't you just understand that we love who we love we are who we are and you run your life and will run ours and everybody will be the happier for it.

Boyfriend cheated?,GloveNo9559,ainbow,"Hey all, I just needed a space to share out my feelings and confusion. I hope this helps.

My boyfriend &amp; I have been in an open relationship (and long distance as well) for a while. We are very well connected emotionally but did gave each other space to go around and meet other guys.

I was not very active in meeting anyone except him however he continued to go out dates with other guys (just for sex). With time I wasn't very okay with this setup and asked him if we can not have an open relationship - the discussion around it wasn't very smooth but we later aligned.

One evening he asks me before meeting one guy with whom he had matched on a dating app for a late night drive. I initially refused but then later told him that he can go but no makeout / kiss. However, I saw that coming.

He messaged me in middle of the night saying that he did make out with a guy and he didn't enjoy it at all, he mentioned that all he could think about is me throughout. He further offered to make the relationship exclusive and not open anymore. He was very certain that he needs nobody else except me.

A part of me was happy to hear that but the fact that he cheated? is just not bearable. He has a very different definition for cheating and he kept emphasising that even while he was kissing the other guy, all he could think was about me. 

I am heavily invested in the person and so is he. We see ourselves together forever. However, I just don't know if I should let this cheating thing go away? I know for a fact he'll never do it again (I trust him on that) but my old idea of monogamy and certain moral principles just don't let me forget about it.

What should I do?"

But I went to Starbucks today and as I pull up to the drive-in window the person behind the window had on a rainbow flag button and a button that said they them and I thought how cool. So I commented to them that I thought their buttons were very cool and and I was very glad that they were able to be themselves and be outspoken about who they are. The person behind the counter was wearing a mask so I didn't recognize them at first. As I pull away from the drive-thru I get a notification on one of my dating apps lo and behold we have been talkin on the dating app and they were texting saying OMG I think I just waited on you at Starbucks. Of course we had some fun with that and chat a little bit about it. But it's so nice to see corporations allowing their staff to present and be who they are. Everyone should have that opportunity. I know there are so many corporations unfortunately that do not allow it unfortunately I work for a company that does not allow certain things for instance it is okay I'm bisexual it's not okay that I paint my nails where anyone can see them. I long for the day when we can all be Who We Are present how we want to dress how we want to and be accepted by everyone around us.  My DM'S are open if you want to talk.

Do you ever feel like your doing a lot of work to achieve your goals but you're just not sure its worth it.  For instance and probably the best example is if you're trans. First you have to convince your family you are trans and you have to pick a new name find a new look decide if you're going to transition fully or partially constantly worrying if you pass learn ways to improve passing etc.  And while the rest of the lgbtqia community doesn't have it as bad we still work daily justifying to other's we're valid.  I know in my journey there were times i felt is it really worth it just to be happy.  Well one day i realized im not doing this just so I can be happy I am doing this so everyone who is lgbtqia has a chance to be happy.  You see we don't just struggle to be our true selves we struggle so others know the path to happiness as well. So when you get to feeling like maybe I should just be straight or stay my agab remember you're worth the struggle because everybody coming behind you is worth it.  Paving the road is never easy for the ones doing the initial work.

Is the use of limp wrist amongst LGBTQ+ identity still considered offensive?,briarrosehasthorns,ainbow,"I wanted to know others opinions. I know on TikTok there has been a trend of doing the limp wrist with the ""ding!"" In a song to show you are Queer. As a result I have seen many memes and others using it as a code when they are talking about if they or someone else may be queer but are in a space that it is not as safe to be open about being LGBTQ+ (for example I live in an area with many homophobes so my sister and I will use it when talking to each other, she is pan I am bi ace). My husband on the other hand (he is straight but an ally) got upset when I used it and said his friend who is gay would find that super offensive and I could get beat up for it so to stop using it. I know the LGBTQ+ community took back Queer so I had assumed we took back the limp wrist too as a way to take away the hate that straight people use against us but I am also still a baby gay so maybe I am wrong.

What is everyone's opinions? Is it ok to use it if you are some form of Queer? Is it only ok to use it if you are a gay man? Or is it never ok to use it?"

This might not be too relevant for my post but this background does plan a huge role in our connection. 

Throughout the years I have established a mindset that does not prioritise a romantic relationship over close friendships. I don't want to spend all of my time with a romantic partner and would be very dissapointed in myself if I would set my friends aside. I have a lot of love for my close friends, I show my love in a verbal and physical way. I tell them how much I appreciate and love them all of the time. I love hugging and cuddling them, having deep conversations and I try to truly connect with them on an emotional level. 

The thing is, I would love to be able to cuddle with my close friends at night, to hold their hand from time to time, etc. But the friends with whom I had a wonderful emotional and (non-sexual) physical connection, always at some point wanted to have sex with me. Which is something that I'm not comfortable with ( in the past and at the moment). I would love to have such friendships again but people either preserve that type of behaviour for their partner or they eventually try to move our connection to a more sexual relationship. I do experience sensual attraction within (some) friendships and the line between romantic and platonic feelings is pretty blurry for me. With sensual attraction I refer to the desire to be close to someone, cuddle with them, stroke them, etc. I sometimes experience the desire to kiss someone as well, but that has only happened with a dear female friend of mine but I did not cross that line, even though it was mutual, she had a romantic and sexual attraction towards me. I was single at the time but she had a relationship. So I didn't want to cross any of their boundaries. I do think that I could experience that type of attraction again but of course not with all of my close friends.


At the moment I feel that I can only share that type of affection with my current partner and I feel very uneasy about that. I had a conversation with him a few weeks ago and I mentioned that I truly miss that type of connection and ended up crying for a few hours. Mostly out of love for my friends. He has a close bond with his friends as well but he does not show that in a physical way. He doesn't have a problem with the friendships that I prefer and we communicate a lot about our connection and our boundaries and needs. He does sometimes worry that I might develop strong romantic feelings for one of those close friends and he is at the moment most worried about women (probably because I had only truly accepted my sexuality a few months before I started seeing him)


I don't know how I could introduce and establish such close friendships again at this point. I love my partner so I obviously would prefer to stay in a relationship with him and build a future together so I would not break up with him to seek such friendships as I truly believe that it would be possible to have such connections outside of a romantic relationship. Sometimes my friends advice to try an open relationship to for example explore my attraction towards women a bit more but I'm very confused how this all fits together and my current relationship is monogamous but openminded (as in, I can hug and cuddle my friends and dance Brazilian zouk, which is quite intimate, without any problems).


I'm sorry if this is all a bit confusing but I feel very conflated at the moment about everything. If needed, I'll try to collect my thought and make a post that is a bit more clear. 

Thank you in advance and with warmest regards"

Please remember I love you and support you.  So how do you come to grips or an understanding of who you are.  I get asked that a lot.  Especially when everyone finds out i came out at 14.  Truth is everyone has their awakening differently no 2 people are exactly the same.  Reason being even the most accepting parents raise their kids under the notion they're automatically straight and the correct gender.  That's why we have people later in life realizing they were trans or gay or bi etc.  It what makes it so hard for them to wrap their heads around.  How many of you have seen post they say well i thought i was straight now im thinking i might be whatever in the lgbtqia rainbow.  Honestly at 14 I just knew it clicked but my parents didn't necessarily raise me straight they just avoided the issue completely just assumed i was straight so me thinking when they said i could be anything figured it meant it was ok to have the feelings and they would accept me they did not.  Turns out me accepting i was bisexual was easy accepting they were homophobic took awhile.  We all come to acceptance eventually don't feel like because you didn't realize it sooner it makes you less of an LGBTQ person it doesn't.  My DM'S are open to anyone who needs to talk.

Tired of hiding my real self but also scared of people's reactions,closetthrowawayita,ainbow,"Sorry, just need to vent and get this off my chest.  
In  short, I'm a man, in my mid 20s, I've known I was gay for about half my  life, maybe a bit more, at first I tried to convince myself I was  straight, took me a lot of time to accept my sexuality, about until  18-19, but still I kept it hidden from everyone, and I still do it now.

Only a few friends know this secret about me, coming out the first time to my friend was hard, scary and I cried a lot.

The  problem is that I'm soo fucking tired of hiding myself, being a person  I'm not, just being what people expect me to be, while I'm not that  person. But still, every time I think about coming out, or at least,  being open, I just can't find the courage to do it, so I end up being  sad that I'm a coward, unable to face the truth, but I'm slightly  happier that I'm not losing friends.

I  also want a relationship with someone, I want to love a guy, cry, laugh  and have fun with him and go intimate, but I'm scared of everyone's  reaction so I don't say anything and stay alone, like I've always been  my whole life.

The only good  thing, for now, is that at least the first guy I came out to, my best  friend, he's gay too (he came out to me first) and I think that's who  gave me the courage to come out to the few people I did, but at least  when I'm with him we can both be ourselves and talk about guys which is  also lucky it's quite easy since we mostly like the same type of guys.

That's  all, I don't really know why i wrote all this, probably just to vent or  just to get some other insights from people that already came out and  are living a happy life. Thank you for reading and giving me this space  to vent.

Oh, as a side note, a few  days ago the italian government stopped a law that promoted equality  for the LGBTQ+ community and all the other minorities, a law that also  wanted to provide also harsher penalties for violence caused by sexual  orientation and similars, isn't this a great news?

"Do you have any arguments against the idea of connectors (plugs), pipes, legos, etc being called ""man"" or ""woman""?",Some-Disk-8462,ainbow,"Connectors (plugs), pipes, legos, etc are called ""man"" or ""woman"", ""penis"" or ""vagina"", because engineers think the connectors look like ""genitals"" and that it's ""easier"" for them to ""make analogies for things that resemble genitalia"". Many, or most, people, think ""literally everything that can connect to another piece has a man/woman designation"": [https://imgur.com/a/C7B0NSN](https://imgur.com/a/C7B0NSN)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_of\_connectors\_and\_fasteners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_of_connectors_and_fasteners)

&gt;The assignment is a direct analogy with genitalia and vaginal intercourse.

I discovered a Christian site that uses this same claim against gay relationships: [https://www.lifesitenews.com/mobile/blogs/airlines-pro-lgbt-ad-reveals-the-fallacy-of-homosexual-couplings](https://www.lifesitenews.com/mobile/blogs/airlines-pro-lgbt-ad-reveals-the-fallacy-of-homosexual-couplings)

&gt;Airline botches pro-gay ad, proves marriage is only between man and woman. If the seat belts, aka safety belts consist of either two men or two women, they dont actually form a belt because they cant connect. They remain simply two rainbow-colored straps, rendering the term belt a misnomer. As such, the first two pairings do not qualify to be identified as either belts or as devices of safety. Because they are non-complementary, neither term applies.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this way, the KLM ad offers a perfect explanation of why gay marriage is an impossible notion.  
&gt;  
&gt;KLMs lesson: defying natural law is dangerous.

The claim is that because only the end of a man and the end of a woman are complementary and ""safe"" in engineering, computers, etc, and if two men or two women, two penises, or two vaginas, meet, the devices and tools can not ""safely"" work, gay relationships can not work out either.

In these other articles, it is said ""homosexuality in other animals is a myth"". Do you have any arguments against the claims above and below?, link: [https://www.conservapedia.com/Homosexuality\_in\_animals\_myth](https://www.conservapedia.com/Homosexuality_in_animals_myth)

&gt;In addition, Dr. Antonio Pardo, Professor of Bioethics at the University of Navarre, Spain, wrote:  
&gt;  
&gt;Properly speaking, homosexuality does not exist among animals.... For reasons of survival, the reproductive instinct among animals is always directed towards an individual of the opposite sex. Therefore, an animal can never be homosexual as such. Nevertheless, the interaction of other instincts (particularly dominance) can result in behavior that appears to be homosexual. Such behavior cannot be equated with an animal homosexuality. All it means is that animal sexual behavior encompasses aspects beyond that of reproduction.\[5\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Some speciesfor example, New Mexico Whiptail lizardsexhibit apparently homosexual behavior. There are no males in the specie. Pseudo-copulation does occur, with one lizard (higher in progesterone) taking on the ""male"" role, while the other takes on the ""female"" role.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite the hotly contested nature of homosexuality in animals, ideologically motivated zoo directors in liberal American cities and progressive European countries are placing their supposedly homosexual animals on parade and declaring it to be fact that the animals are gay and that homosexuality occurs naturally in nature. In addition to the famed ""gay penguins"" Roy and Silo at the Central Park Zoo in Manhattan there has been a supposed homosexual animal photo and video gallery in the zoo in Oslo, Norway, featuring flamingoes among other allegedly gay animals.\[9\]  
&gt;  
&gt;However, in July 2009, an alleged homosexual penguin in a California zoo was debunked. Peter LaBarbera reported:  
&gt;  
&gt;San Franciscos Fox affiliate KTVU reports: The San Francisco Zoos popular same-sex penguin couple has broken up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Male Magellan penguins Harry and Pepper have been together since 2003. The pair nested together and even incubated an egg laid by another penguin in 2008, but their relationship hit the rocks earlier this year when a female penguin, Linda, befriended Harry after her long-time companion died.  
&gt;  
&gt;Zookeepers say Harry and Linda are happy and were able to successfully nest this year, reported KTVU.  
&gt;  
&gt;But not everyone is celebrating Harry and Lindas newfound love. Some believe there can be no such a thing as an ex-gay penguin. Upon news of Harrys decision to fly the same-sex-coop, outspoken pro-homosexual activist and anti-ex-gay crusader Wayne Besen cried fowl:  
&gt;  
&gt;Attempts to change sexual orientation are patently offensive, discriminatory by definition, theologically shaky, uniformly unsuccessful and medically unsound! exclaimed a visibly angry Besen. There is no ex-gay sexual orientation. Harry is simply in denial. Hes living what I call the big lie.\[11\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The denial that homosexuality is a choice by homosexual activists and liberals is similar to the behavior fat acceptance movement activists who insist that being overweight is never a choice and ostracize ex-overweight people (see: fat acceptance movement for details).  
&gt;  
&gt;Researchers claim that the reason for homosexual behavior in non-social animals is related to dominance, preparing for future heterosexual encounters, to expel low-quality sperm, and to engage in reproductive suppression.\[12\] Salamanders were inspected in 90 different pairs. The males would mimic females in order to trick the male into depositing unprofitable spermatophores. The rival male wastes his sperm, aiding the mimicker in spreading his genes to an actual female.\[13\] These examples show that non-social animals may have homosexual tendencies, but are acting aggressively in order to distribute their genes and to suppress the reproduction of other males.  
&gt;  
&gt;Macaques were studied engaging in same-sex behavior. However, a female may engage in female-female mounting, but that doesn't mean she isn't interested in males. Females often mount males, apparently to encourage them to mate more. Once they had learned this behavior, it was easy for them to apply it to other females as well.\[14\] We may never find a wild animal that is strictly homosexual in the way some humans are.

&gt;Anyone engaged in the most elementary animal observation is forced to conclude that animal homosexuality, filicide and cannibalism are exceptions to normal animal behavior. Consequently, they cannot be called animal instincts. These observable exceptions to normal animal behavior result from factors beyond their instincts.  
&gt;  
&gt; Clashing Stimuli and Confused Animal Instincts  
&gt;  
&gt;To explain this abnormal behavior, the first observation must be the fact that animal instincts are not bound by the absolute determinism of the physical laws governing the mineral world. In varying degrees, all living beings can adapt to circumstances. They respond to internal or external stimuli.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, animal cognition is purely sensorial, limited to sound, odor, touch, taste and image. Thus, animals lack the precision and clarity of human intellectual perception. Therefore, animals frequently confuse one sensation with another or one object with another.  
&gt;  
&gt;Third, an animals instincts direct it towards its end and are in accordance with its nature. However, the spontaneous thrust of the instinctive impulse can suffer modifications as it runs its course. Other sensorial images, perceptions or memories can act as new stimuli affecting the animals behavior. Moreover, the conflict between two or more instincts can sometimes modify the original impulse.  
&gt;  
&gt;In man, when two instinctive reactions clash, the intellect determines the best course to follow, and the will then holds one instinct in check while encouraging the other. With animals that lack intellect and will, when two instinctive impulses clash, the one most favored by circumstances prevails.\[4\]  
&gt;  
&gt;At times, these internal or external stimuli affecting an animals instinctive impulses result in cases of animal filicide, cannibalism and homosexuality.

&gt;Im responding to Gregory Clarks March 26 guest commentary, Homosexuality is biologically natural, not deviant. First of all, lightning rods were devised to protect buildings and people from lightning. Homosexuality doesnt protect anyone at all; its acting on sexual fantasies.  
&gt;  
&gt;The writer of the March 30 letter, Pro-homosexuality argument is naturally bogus, stated, animals operate primarily on instinct. Another comment mentioned that breathing, sleeping, drinking and eating are natural, but these actions are essential for survival. Homosexuality is not.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is people who ascribe human concepts, such as homosexuality, to observable behavior in animals. Since animals cant verbalize to us why they participate in any behavior (including homosexual acts), we can only make educated guesses. This was acknowledged by the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatry Association in the Lawrence vs. Texas case, legalizing homosexuality.  
&gt;  
&gt;Reading The Animal Homosexuality Myth, by Luiz Solimeo, there are many factors in homosexual acts including: dominance, alleviating social tension, confused instincts, and mixed external stimuli. With dogs, smelling a female dog in heat leads to mounting. After a male dog has mated with a female dog, the females odor can linger on the male dog. As a result, it can be mistakenly mounted by another male dog.

For the confused instinct part, I found this article on insects that says insects that have gay sex are just confused: [https://www.livescience.com/38931-insect-gay-sex.html](https://www.livescience.com/38931-insect-gay-sex.html)

&gt;The team focused on male-male interactions to simplify the analysis, and found that most of these encounters occurred as accidents.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whereas larger animals have developed more complicated homosexual motivations  like maintaining alliances, which has been found in certain primate and seagull species  insects seem to mistakenly partake in it in a hasty attempt to secure mates.  
&gt;  
&gt;In some cases, males carry around the scent of females they have just mated with, sending confusing signals to other perusing males. In other cases, males and females look so similar to one another that males cannot tell if a potential mate is a female until he mounts ""her"" and prepares for the act, Scharf said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sometimes, such extreme indiscrimination leads to mating with inanimate objects, as has been observed in beetles trying to mount glass bottles  
&gt;  
&gt;The glass bottle ""looks like a huge female to them,"" Scharf said. ""They just try to mate with whatever gives them a vague impression of an opportunity.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Other studies do, however, show evidence of more intentional and malicious motivations behind homosexual insect sex. Male butterflies, moths and wasps, for example, use same-sex encounters to distract competitors from potential female mates. Certain beetles have even been found to use same-sex mounting as a way to spread sperm to other males that may then pass it along to the next female he mounts, though this mechanism does not appear to be very effective.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since male insect anatomy is not designed to accept male genitals, improper penetration can cause bodily damage in aggressively competing mates. This anatomy blocker is not a problem for all species, since not all insect sex involves penetration. Even so, one study found that certain male insects have developed femalelike genitals to lower the risk of damage from homosexual penetration."

Im part of a group chat with mostly straight guys and several guys and gals part of the LGBT+ community all within 18-25.  Weve known each other for several years now, so were pretty close. We were messing with one of our friends in the chat whos a straight male, and we were saying how its funny to imagine reading a meme he sent in his voice.  One of the other guys, also a straight male, said he sounds like a guy with a husband.  I texted back saying I think that line might be kinda homophobic.  Another friend, a bi male, said he was fine with it.  Then the guy that originally texted that line immediately apologized.  I told him its cool, Im straight but just didnt want any of our other friends that arent straight to feel uncomfortable.

I was wondering whether or not Im overthinking that statement to be homophobic or not?  We would consider all our chat members to be pretty LGBT friendly and aware of everyones orientations, but Id say that doesnt make us immune to insensitive statements, especially if the chat is primarily cisgender heterosexual males.

I want to talk to you about something that I may have already posted before but if I have it Bears repeating. This life that we're living as lgbtqia community is ours and ours alone. Each person is unique in how they experience it. For example if you're bisexual you may be 50/50 men to women or men to non-binary or whatever or you may be 90/10 or whatever it doesn't matter. Your version of bisexual is going to be different than mine for example and that's okay it's supposed to be that way. It also applies to all lgbtqia for example if your trans you don't have to ask if you pass you pass. Let's say for example your male to female there are all different shapes and sizes of women just like there's all different shapes and sizes of men and non-binary excetera. You are unique and special and you're going to look just like the woman or just like the man or just like the non-binary you're supposed to be don't try to compare yourself to anybody else be yourself. Folks we no longer need to concern ourselves with if I'm bisexual enough if I'm gay enough if I'm lesbian enough if I'm trans enough if I'm asexual enough Etc yes you are. Wherever you fall within the lgbtqia community you are exactly that. You don't have to reach some magic number to be considered lgbtqia if you feel just the slightest bit bisexual then be bisexual don't worry about what others say worry about what you feel. I promise you you will be far happier if you concern yourself with being the best version of you that you can be. My DM's are open if you need to talk at all please feel free to message me.

Love dad"

I had an amazing day today well as amazing as working at a funeral home can be.  We had a service for man's husband who had died of covid.  Now the amazing part was the service was held at an LGBTQ church.  The pastor was lesbian and just the coolest woman ever.  The service was upbeat and a true celebration.  In my opinion what a funeral should be.  The entire congregation at the church is a variety of members in the lgbtqia community and allies.  Honestly I've been out of church for awhile cause they were so anti LGBTQ that after today it makes me wanna visit them for a regular service.  I fully believe its possible to LGBTQ and religious whatever religion that may he.  Now im not here to try and convince anybody to join any religion.  What i am saying is if religion is important to you then you can be LGBTQ and spiritual.  I don't have all the answers but I do know a good bit on Christianity.

I'm confused with myself and would like some 'answers'.,Pelicaros,ainbow,"Hello there I don't mean to be offensive in any way. I haven't taken part in this community ever (I was scared to) and would like some answers about myself. I've seen all the (flags/concepts. Is that the right word?) about lgbti+ community but am not able to identify with one (100%) I found yet.  

Thanks to this society I was scared to admit my own associations with this community. I'm a 21 year old male and like to dress as a women. Make'up, clothing and 'expression in the female gender' (still scared shitless of expressing the female gender though haha).

Lately I've been more and more motivated to come out with it. Like I told I'm a 21 year old male. I've had a interest with being female since I was 16. I've crossdressed and done my own make up (not in public) since then.

I've told part of my story to my girlfriend (She is the only one who knows, not even my family) and thank god she is so supportive (I love her very much). She thinks it's okay I do my own make up ('ve also told here I slept with a man) and she was absolutely fine with it. 

But I don't know what ""group"" i fall (partially) into. I want to read about me, things I associate with. Things that make me feel welcome into this world. Things I relate to. Things that make me feel 'normal'. I would appreciate any answer.

I might seem fague (well I do to me) but I welcome any response key words: I'm bi + ike to dress and act feminime.

Thank you so much for reading :)."

I had already told them i was bi leaning more to gay.  They were so accepting and so cool it was an amazing experience for both of us.  I learned he had just come out to his parents as bi and was getting the frog for bi representation as well as pride flag for love of all lgbtqia people.  His parents came in a short while later.  Turns out they didn't know this particular shop was cash only and had run to the bank.  They both were getting tattoo as well in rainbow colors saying proud mama and proud papa.  It was so awesome seeing the love they shared.  I shared my story with them about how my parents reacted when I came out was way different then how they reacted.  Once we were done i wished them the best and we parted ways.  All parents should be this understanding.  My DM'S are open to anyone who needs to talk.

Obsessing,Medosrc,ainbow,"Hey guys :)

I have a story to tell and I thought it would help, if I tell it here. Maybe you guys could help me.

So, about a year ago, I started to follow a guy named J on Instagram. We followed each other for a long time and at one point, I commented on one of his selfies on his stories and told him that I thought he was cute. Afterwards, we chatted now and then. It was always I who initiated the conversation and - honestly - he didn't really seem that interested into me (though he is someone who was really hard for me to decipher). Fast forward some months and he and I match on Tinder. Then again, I started chatting and he would always answer (sometimes after hours, but sometimes also after 1-2 days). At one point I asked him, whether he wanted to go out with me, but he had no time then. Some weeks later I asked him again and he said that he would like to go out with me, but then when the moment came, he said he thinks we would only work as friends, but not more. That kind of devastated me. For me, the whole thing was a ""lost cause"" after that point.

The thing is: I thought we would have worked out maybe. We had so many similar character traits and I found him a really interesting and attractive person. What annoyed me the most is that he never gave me a chance and I don't understand why you would answer and chat and match with a person if you have no interest in meeting that person or if you don't find them attractive (though it has happened many times that over chat it worked great with a guy and then when the moment came to meet, they chicken out). It just pissed me off and I never got a chance to release my anger and my frustration. Sometimes I wish I would have just been more honest with him and tell him, that he isn't all that great).

I don't know. Often times, I idealize a person over chat and then I am devastated if it doesn't work out (even though I have never met those guys). Now, last Saturday, I went to his Instagram profile again (I check his Instagram profile waaay too many times, even though we don't even follow each other anymore, I removed him from my followers) and then I saw that he is in a relationship now and that did a lot of things to me. I was angry, sad, jealous, etc. I was asking myself, whether I could've been that person. In his bio stood ""B"" and a heart. I think he did date a guy once whose name started with a B and it didn't work out. It kind of gave me satisfaction that he would run back to a guy with whom it didn't work out the first time. I compare myself to J all the time, and I kind of want to ""win"". I don't want to be the one who lost. I know that this isn't maybe the healthiest way to think, but it helps me sometime. I don't want to see just all the ""good"" in him, maybe I am happier if I know he isn't that perfect like the way I pictured him. I don't know.

When I compared myself to J, I realized not too lang ago that I see him as a better version of myself. He has all the character traits that I have, but somehow he doesn't hide them or accepts himself more than I accept myself. Of course, this all happened over chat in my head, but I don't seem to be able to let go. I realized that I am a really obsessive person, not just in this part of my life. I just don't seem to be able to let go. 

There is so much more I wanna tell, but I think this is enough for the first part. I told most of my friends and my psychiatrist about this J-story and it has helped to some extent. But sometimes I would wish that when I tell someone that this problem would be instantly solved and vanish. It kind of didn't work that way. Last week was tough, but I stayed strong. I know I will get over it eventually, but right not at the moment, this is the thing that is most on my mind and it just doesn't go away that easily.

So, this story was kind of a mess and I didn't tell every little single thing. I hope, someone gets me and could maybe try to help with some kind words or maybe someone has experienced something similar?"

Today I want to remind all of you that you are valid I don't care where you fall into the category of lgbtqia+ you're valid. I'm not going to get into a religious debate all I want to say is it's not a sin I know what some religions talk about and preach it is not a sin you are okay. There is nothing mentally wrong with you you don't have some kind of Disconnect in your brain that is making you this way if that were true you would have other issues other than just being lgbtqia. You should have the love and support of your parents your family your friends and your community unfortunately they've all been taught that who we are is wrong that we are some kind of freak of nature an anomaly if you will. Some are accepting and I'm thankful for those that are but we should be able to count on our family to support us in anything we do. Somebody posted earlier today that it shouldn't even be a question if your parents support you.  They have no problem supporting when you get good grades they support you in athletics  they support you in anything that you do then they should support you being lgbtqia just as easy but that's not always the case. Well I'm here to remind you like I said earlier you are valid that's it plain and simple you are just as valid as anyone who is not lgbtqia. There is no difference between us and them except who we love and that should not be a stigma that separates us just like people of A different race should not be looked at differently we should all be treated equally. Again I love you I support you and if you need anything my DM's are always open.

Mugged for my ramen noodles,Way_Zealousideal,ainbow,"Title says it all, but i'll break it down because i need to vent lol.   


i just turned 18, told my family i was trans and got laughed at for it, i said screw that and took off in my van. I was doing pretty good, doing oddjobs on craigslist or donating plasma to help get me from town to town while making my way to California for the LBGTQ friendly shelters and job support. I parked in a hotel parking lot tonight and laid down for bed with my windows only slightly cracked for air flow, only to wake up to my overhead light illuminating my vehicle. Sombody had reached in and opened the door, and had a knife at my face. He was laughing, calling me every vile name he could think of, wishing death on me and calling me lucky. They got everything from me, my wallet, bag of clothes, makeup, everything, even my 4-pack bag of chile ramen noodles.   


I don't want to go into detail, but this is a targeted event. I recognized this man from earlier in the night when i went into the hotel to use the bathroom, he saw me while having a cigarette and chose to attack me because i am trans. Of course i called the police, they took my statement and said they have to contact Red Roof Inn cooperate to get access to the security footage, only to tell me that i'm loitering and cannot be sleeping in my van otherwise they will impound my van.   


So here i am, 340 miles away from my destination, no food, no money, no gas. My family won't help, my mom txtd me saying ""You asked for that trouble when you left the house"", and it's not like i have any friends on this side of the country. It's bullshit. How are people so transphobic still? Have you ever ran into somthing like this?"

No I haven't met you but I love you and support you as a parent just the same.  You see we're family bonded by a common theme being lgbtqia+.  We share the same battles the same harassment the same rejection the same need to belong to something or someone to love us.  We have or had the same fears and anxiety coming out.  We are a family and we need each other.  I heard a story today of another lgbtqia teen committing suicide.  We need to check on each other reach out to each other make sure we all ok.  We need to make sure no more teens suffer and commit suicide because society bullies them makes fun of them or because their families don't except them.  To put the icing on the cake this teens dad actually said at least its on more of them we don't have to deal with. We all know family shouldn't be that way that's why we need each other to be the family we all need.  My DM'S are open if anyone needs to talk im always available.

Has anyone else had their PayPal account closed for being queer/trans?,sorcerykid,ainbow,"Back in 2012, I received the most shocking email from PayPal informing me (very vaguely) that they determined that activities on my account were not consistent with the PayPal User Agreement. That email was sent exactly one day after I receiving a $1 USD donation from someone on my Website. When I reached out to customer support, they refused to disclose any details about what led to their decision for ""security"" reasons, only that the determination was final and cannot be appealed.

It seemed all too suspicious, of course. So I did my own research, starting with my Web server logs. Thankfully, in those days the logs still included referrer URLs from Google searches. Right off the bat, I noticed some very peculiar search strings, included references to my name and sexuality. I checked the IP address of the requests which continued over the span of 25 minutes. Lo-and behold they belonged to the policy enforcement department of PayPal Inc.

So I jumped onto Google and performed a search for those exact same terms. The first results that came up were for queer and trans erotica sites where I had years ago posted some amateur photos. That means a PayPal employee was actively investigating my personal life as a queer/trans individual (that had nothing to do with PayPal), in order to determine that I violated their User Agreement.

That is not only deeply disturbing to have a PayPal employee researching and documenting someone's personal life, but even moreso that they would then actively use such information unfairly against someone, without divulging the discriminatory basis of their decision."

When you look at the lgbtqia community what do you see? You see young people old people people who are cops lawyers nurses funeral directors ministers the list goes on. What you see is everyday people just like the hetero community. In other words there is no difference between what we can do compared to everybody else. We can be professional athletes we can be singers actors heads of state politician you name it the list goes on. There is no difference in how strong we are talented we are how good we are compared to anybody else. There are a lot of stereotypes about our community that have people believing we can't do the same things that the heterosexual Community can do but we can. We are just as important as anyone else and you should never forget that.

Walkaway users can't seem to figure out why someone who just had a newborn baby would be with that baby in a hospital, with commenters questioning why they're in the hospital at all (where do they think babies are born?), being outraged that they aren't wearing masks (in what is assuredly a private room, and during what is obviously meant to be a celebratory family photo, of the vaccinated parents and *babies that will be living with them*), all while throwing in little quips about how they 'desperately want to be women' and that their children were 'born into a perverse situation' and 'have no chance at a normal life', because both their parents are men.

One goes so far as to say 

&gt;I wonder which one of them are wearing the blood soaked pad between their legs? I mean, they want to cosplay child birth so I assume they are doing that as well.

One comment, simply the word ""Gross"", has 44 upvotes, and someone thanked the poster for posting it.

Another calls his paternity leave maternity leave, apparently unaware that paternity leave is a real thing straight couples also have.

But then he literally looks at me and says ...,ArrivalPurpleXXX,ainbow,"I started my new job around 1 year ago.  Great company, great people, etc.  Automatically, i was attracted to 1 of the outside sales guys that lives about 5 hours away.  Over time, we were able to connect via work calls &amp; conversation that lead to us (in my mind) grower a little closer.  Besides the fact that he is great at what he does, i literally could not be any more attracted to him - he is SO my type.  With similar scenarios, the both of us were around 1 year out of long term relationships.   
 He seemingly had a guy he would attend ""social media story post worthy"" events with.  Anyway, time goes on and i start to develop more into the sales side of the company which puts me spending a week in his market.  The very first night i am there, there was a football game that entailed a lot of day drinking which lead into the night.  I got there that evening and he called me to go meet them at the bar they were at.  I ended up seeing someone i randomly knew and rode over with them.  About 2 hours into the night, he was already drunk from the day/night of drinking. But then he literally looks at me and says ""I wish i would have met you before i met (insert the other guys name"".  My brain sunk in to my heart, my heart sunk to my feet.  I couldnt really reply much because the friend i rode with was hearing everything.  What i wanted to say was that I 100% agreed with him!  Later, they wanted to go to another bar.  I tagged along.  I ended up making notions that he really wanted to take me outside and kiss me.  It got kind of obvious that he had interest and some of they guys friends were making comments.  I cannot stand that so i ended up telling one of the off privately lol.  The next day, we prepped for the event i was there for.  He called me to go to brunch and i said i probably should bc of what happened last night - especially with some of the guys friends there.  He was like ""wait what happened last night??"".  My brain and heart sunk again, now afraid he didnt remember saying what he spilled to me.  A couple hours later, he arrives at the venue to help me and 2 other people prep...and he had plenty of mimosas = a buzz again.  He asked me what was happended with the friends last night and i told him that they were making comments about him because he ""was making it kind of obvious"".  I ended up just asking him ""do you remember what you said?"" and he seemed irritated with himself and annoyed  and responded ""yes i remember what I said"".  That conversation fell there because people walked in.  A week later i (this is sad) pretended to get drunk and text him telling him that i too agreed with what he told me that night.....to no response.  I can tell him demeaner has changed but i cannot stop thinking about it because i am that into him.  Do you think he meant what he said and he just feels akward?  Does he regret everything about it?  Why can i not stop thinking about him?!?!?!"

There wasn't any nudity involved, but still some pretty suggestive poses, a blindfold that also doubled as a rope sometimes, and 2/3 of our costumes were leather, latex, very form-fitting, or otherwise also suggestive.

Eventually, one of the shots is just me and friend 1. She has me blindfolded, sitting with my back to the wall and legs stretched, one of her hands is pressed against both of mine and pinning them to the wall above me while the other is on my side and pulling my skirt down a few inches, and her face is about 5 inches from mine. I got the hots and she could tell as I (not realizing until she told me in a pretty amused way) had a pretty huge smile. I really wanted to kiss her at that moment (but didn't). We took some photos like that and then did some with friend 2.

   And frankly I don't know what to think. Friend 1 has stated multiple times that she doesn't think she considers herself bi (with the exception of her admitting she may be bi for friend 2) because although she has kissed and will kiss other women and has slept with and will sleep with other women, she doesn't like what's below the waist. But at the same time she asks me and the other female friend if we want to do these pics (which don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed posing for them) and asks for me, and she knows that I'm bi, to do the most intimate shot with her.

There were about 4 other people in the room at the same time that these photos were being taken, so I don't know if that affected anything. I want to say no, because like I said, our friend group is really, really close and nonchalant around each other, but I can't say no for sure. I didn't say anything to her during the rest of the party or afterward because of her saying she's not bi and I didn't want to make things weird, but like, I just don't know how to feel about this. It almost felt like she was being a bit of a tease, maybe? I'm not sure. I'm also sorta new to the LGBT community; I just came out in July. So maybe part of my perspective is me just not having seen enough? Anyways though, does anyone have thoughts, advice, or a fresh perspective on this situation?"

After the Boi\_Fancy mailing list went offline in 2001, I decided to bring it back in Discord style!

I wanted to give genderqueer, genderfluid, and gender nonconforming males a safe-space to hang out online and just be ourselves without judgment (anyone with a male experience is welcome, even if you are still questioning your gender).

The goal of Boi\_Fancy is to be an open-minded, kindhearted community focused on fashion, makeup, music, games, art, and other hobbies and interests that strike our fancy! There's also restricted rooms for discussion of more serious subjects like depression, coming out, dating, etc. in confidence.

So many of you find yourselves in a situation like I was in when I was growing up. You got parents who just don't get it who don't understand who you are and why you are lgbtqia. I myself did not realize my family was that way until I came out and it was too late I was kicked out of the house. A lot of you however know how your families are already you've heard them make homophobic statements you've heard them talk about and make fun of the gays and the lesbians and the bisexuals and the transsexuals and the list goes on. I know you find yourself in a place where you have no one to talk to. There's no one at home that understands what you're going through there's no one at home you can turn to and a lot of time your friends in the community are small because you live in an area where there's not a very large lgbtqia community. That's why I'm here that's why I signed everything dad. I want to be that online parent for you if nothing else to give you support to give you advice to help you when I can and if I don't know an answer I promise I will do everything I can to find it I won't let you struggle alone. All you have to do is Reach Out you don't have to wonder about answers to your questions anymore I am here to help.  My DM'S are open if you want to talk im here.

all of this is to ask if any of yall have any comparable resources like the lesbian doc but for mlm? also anything related to dealing with internalized homophobia from a cis male perspective. everything i've found online has just been super generic and... not at at all helpful so docs, videos, books, literally whatever would be super appreciated!!! thank you in advance :D"

Confused on what I am,dumbstupidbitch69,ainbow,"So for reference I'm a cis girl.

Recently I've realized that I basically want a male body with a few exceptions. I also think going by he/him would be cool. I'm not trans, I'm comfortable with being a girl I guess but I think these features and things would make me more happy. 

The main things I would want is a deeper voice, more masculine face, hands, feet, Adam's apple, and a flat chest. I also want to be way taller because I'm 5'0 but ik that can't be changed easily. I would want to look like more of a feminine amab body with no facial and body hair and a more feminine silhouette. 

I would also still dress femininely a lot of the time if I had those features, I would still wear skirts and dresses and stuff. I'm just not sure how any of this would be achievable. 

But then again I have no idea if I would ever miss having a afab body if I did somehow manage to get my ideal body. So maybe I'm gender fluid? I don't just want to change clothing style though, I want the features, especially the face, hands, voice, and Adam's apple. Also, I'm a minor, maybe I shouldn't be thinking about this stuff too deeply anyways."

Eventually their conversation got to the point where he said that she didnt know history, was being indoctrinated in school because she correctly pointed out that we know better than the slave-owning/raping founding fathers, et cetera. At that point I wasnt going to let him insult my little sister for being more educated, and I said that its racist to defend owning slaves because they were already slaves in africa!. He then said Orrin, you know me better than that, you know Im not racist, which for some reason really got to me, so I said dad, I do know you quite well, and thats how I know youre a racist, homophobic piece of shit. He then said Im not scared of gay people, Im friends with [gay guy from church who literally wrote a book about how hes never been romantically or sexually involved with another man, never will be, and recommends other gay people do the same]. At that point I was astounded I even had to explain that homophobia isnt about literal fear, that having a token gay friend who represses all romantic and sexual feelings doesnt help his case, and I also had to explain that gay people dont reproduce isnt a good reason to hate them.

to come out or not,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey gang it's Dad just checking in with you I hope you had a great Monday. Don't ever forget how much I love you respect you support you and also how very valid you are

So I don't know if I have covered a question like this before or not I went back through some of my other post to see if I could find one but there was so many I just couldn't go through all of them so it's not going to hurt to post it again. I had somebody the other day I was talking to that was gay and was questioning whether or not he even needed to come out. Honestly that's a very valid question do you have to come out. For some people it is very import it sets their identity and who they are and they want to share it with everyone. They like being identified as whatever their sexuality or gender is therefore they feel the need to come out so that people will know. And that's very valid  a lot of the times the reason people come out is they just have this Burning this desire that they have to let people know. Then you have the other side of the coin. You have those people who questioned why even come out people don't have to come out as straight why do I have to come out as gay or bi or lesbians Etc or transgender whatever. And truth is you don't have to there is no requirement for you to come out. Honestly I agree with these people why does it feel like we're required to come out and tell you what our sexuality or gender is you don't go around telling people you're straight cis-male why do I have to tell everybody I'm bisexual male it doesn't make any sense. Our sexuality and gender is our business therefore you are under no obligation to come out to anyone. So as you can see it's a choice one way or the other. Whichever way you're leaning whichever way feels right to you then that's what you should do there is no right or wrong. My DMs are open for anyone who would like to discuss it further or has anything else they would like to talk about.

Like this weekend I was celebrating my sister's wedding and I told her I would dress up in a dress. I got my nails done all that comes with being a bridesmaid and I felt like an absolute clown to be honest. 

I'm dating my girlfriend, we've been dating for 8 months now and it's been pretty incredible sense I found her. But we both are scared to tell our folks because their both super Christian and I know they'd condemn us. Luckily my sister and her husband that I live with love me and my girl and accept us. And my girlfriends sister accepts her as well. 

So anyway  I got off track there, does anyone know exactly what I am?

Do you ever feel dating as lgbtqia is more difficult than hetero.  I always have though it doesn't discourage me.  I find flirting within the different genders is different therefore picking up in cues of flirting from them is too.  For example my kids and I were eating out today.  As we were going into the restaurant a man complimented my shoes and I complimented his outfit and we moved on.  My daughter said dad he was flirting with you you should have got his number I was clueless I thought it was just a compliment.  Later a enby that I met while we were walking in the mall complimented them.  I thanked them and said I liked their hair it was a pretty teal color.  Again I believe in that case it was just a compliment but now im second guessing everything.  Lol maybe why im still single.  Does anyone else feel this way.

I get told bisexuality isn't real, or that I'm making it up for attention, or that me being bi is weird or gross because I was assigned male at birth.

Growing up, I never even *heard* the word bisexual. Of course it technically existed (I grew up in the 90's), but not in my little slice of the world. The only people around me who could openly be anything resembling bisexual were the girls at my school; any time I deviated even slightly from having an interest in girls or displayed any non-masculine tenancies, I was immediately met with slurs or screams about going to hell or even violence. And I knew I wasn't *gay*, because I liked girls, but I wasn't really *straight* either. But I could pass as straight and not be met with violence and religious hate.

This led to years and years of me convincing, deluding, myself into thinking I was straight. I dated and had sex exclusively with women, missing out on some life experiences that I still regret missing. My own inner thoughts about myself were terrible and hateful any time I found a guy attractive, or had an interest in a feminine activity. But I recognize now that while my inner thoughts were spoken in my voice, they weren't my own words. They were the words of the people who hated me.

Anyways, sorry for the rant, I was just being introspective in the shower this morning and needed to get this out. I'm in a better, healthier place now, very proud of who I am and what I've had to fight and struggle with to be seen the way I want to be."
Can we talk about settling?,pineapplepossibility,ainbow,"Gay cis female here, age 44, midatlantic USA.

Because there are fewer people for us LGBTQ+ folks to ""choose from"" -  romantically - than straight people, i feel like we are more likely to settle for people who aren't truly right for us.

Or, better put, we are more likely to ""round up"".

Maybe someone we're interested in checks most of the boxes, but there are a few BIG ONES that are left un-checked. Because on even a subconscious  level, you don't think the odds are very good you'll meet the person who totally delights you. So you commit to someone ""good enough"".

i know there's not one person for everybody. i know romantic relationships aren't meant to fulfill every need. i know ""you should be happy alone"" and ""love yourself first"". But that's not what I'm talking about here.

I married someone who was beautiful, brilliant, kind, and we connected on so many values. spent 10 years together until we got divorced on very good terms.

The whole time we were married, i knew there were lots of reasons why i loved being with her, but we didn't really make each other laugh. And she didn't like being affectionate with me in front of people.

And it feels embarrassing to say, but i didn't click with her the way i knew i was capable of clicking with people. i just thought she was so amazing and interesting, that the click would be something that would happen over time (it didn't, not really).

After we got divorced, i was stunned - the biggest emotion in me wasn't sadness. It was terror.

Terror because i realized that as much as i loved her, I had also settled for her.

Deep down, i knew the WHOLE TIME that she wasn't the right one for me. But i proposed and we got married anyway.

Terror, because there are not many women to choose from, and i might settle  again. and worse yet, someone might settle for me. Maybe she had, too (the least of my worries, but hey).

Straight people have this population problem to a degree, but we have it so much more acutely. Consider even more marginalized members of our community, and the problem exacerbates.

What  do you think? Do you think we LGBTQ+ folks settle more often than we admit, because our options are so much more limited? And what does that do to us? And how can we adapt our hearts and minds so this isn't so terrifying and sad?"

My young niece asked me last if there was an age that's to young to come out.  When I asked her why she's asking because she's already out she told me they had a new kid come to their GSA meeting.  He's 12 and is gay but unsure when to come out.  The GSA leader according to my niece didn't know how to respond.  Bless their hearts they try but most don't know enough about lgbtqia to help.  It's like really do some online research at least duh.  The other thing is be honest that's all they need.  I swear if they'd let me I'd lead it but you have to be a teacher at the school to lead a club.  Anyway to answer the question.  Simply put there is no age limit to coming out.  When you're sure you know your sexuality or gender or whatever it is you're coming out for you can do so. Side note i don't know why we have to come out or tell anyone if we're gay bi trans pan etc. because they're not required to come out as straight.  Anyway back to us.  You only need to make certain it is safe to come out when you do.  Make certain you're not gonna be kicked out or bullied at home.  If you are don't come out.  If you still want to come out have a safe place lined up to go.  Have a bag pre packed and ready try and save some money if possible.  The truth is no one can tell you when it's right for you only you know that.  Just have a plan on what you're going to say as well as be ready to educate them if they have questions.  Again have an escape plan is you will ready to.  Not everyone gets kicked out but you could so be prepared.  My DM'S are open if you need to talk.

"Friendly reminder: It's possible to be male but not a ""man"".",sorcerykid,ainbow,"There's this all-too-common assumption that just because someone admits to being male, that they must also accept being a man. Yet these are two distinct identities. and they are not always interchangeable, even for people that regard themselves as cisgender.

The word ""man"" is heavily loaded with cultural connotations of hegemonic masculinity, compared to the more value-neutral, male; e.g. ""Be a man!"" or ""Man-up!"". Even the word ""Manhood"" reinforce this distinction.

And of course ""woman"" runs into nearly the same issue, albeit A really good example of this phenomenon was trans rights activist Leslie Feinberg, who identified as female and a lesbian but not a ""woman""."

Are younger gay men automatically victims/prey if they're with older gay men?,briendoesitallbad,ainbow,"I want to preface this with, if this isn't homophobic, I will take my lumps (downvotes) understandably. The context of this is, I am 42 dating a 27 year old.

After I responded that her statement (specifically her first line, but the rest too) was homophobic, she responded with this.

To me, this is just more ""gay men are pedophiles"" shit. It perpetuates a stereotype that not only isn't true, but is actively harmful to the gay community.

For more context, I previously was with men significantly older than me (20 with a 46 year old, 31 with a 46 year old). I can see the 20/46 because sure, that could be predatory, but am I wrong in saying that someone who's 31 (or 27 for that matter) has enough life experience and autonomy to not be ""prey""? 

This gets under my skin personally because it puts me out to be a victim at 31. I was making almost as much money as my ex-husband. I can't for the life of me figure out how I was a victim at all.

I will be fully truthful - I am looking for either validation or browbeating here. If I'm wrong, I want to know it. But I also want to know why. I want to know how someone who is a mature adult can be prey because they're dating someone older."

I'm broke, homeless, pushed out if my hometown. What now? For anyone who's been exiled like this, how did you recover? Does family ever come back from somthing like this? I feel no anger towards them, I just want what I had with them again

Super Confused,SecretaryStraight780,ainbow,Lately I havent been getting aroused by women and have found an interest in men. I feel much more comfortable around men honestly. But i can never see myself actually being in a relationship with one. I dont know if this is internalized homophobia or me being worried what others with think.  Ive been struggling with this for a while now and just want to make up my mind.

Queer romance! Need tips &amp; advice,Revolutionary-Duck62,ainbow,"Hi there, I've partially decided to post because I'm happy and excited. I (female) have been chatting with a lady I met on a dating app for about 3-4 months, we were both in Covid lockdown. She seems great &amp; we have a lot in common. As restrictions are easing, I summoned up the courage to ask her out to an art gallery next weekend as we both like art. She agreed. 

I had a few dates with one lady prior to lockdown, but it fizzled out. Otherwise, I've mostly dated men as I wasn't out for a long time, and for a lot of my young life - sexuality was kind of the least of my concerns or focus. I've been on a long trauma, and therapy-to-deal-with-the-trauma journey. I'm in a really good place in myself, and this feels right.

So, yeah it feels hard to know dating protocol in the queer space, any tips or tricks I should know? I have been connecting with local queer community, prior to lockdowns and stuff so I was trying to get comfortable in the space but I feel a bit isolated from it again. Hopefully, I can get out in community again soon as well. 

Thanks :) (PS. really happy &amp; excited)"

Gender discussion as a bi man outside the LGBT community,stockishot,ainbow,"Hello, I'm not trying to be rude and I do see that posting here could be considered rude. First off I belief there is only two genders. I acknowledge gender dysphoria is real and happy to help fight for Trans issues. With that being said your either male or female. Other genders are more like adjectives that describe one's feelings. I think the my main belief is there is a large shunning of people who don't want be how their gender is expected to behave. Men can paint their nails wear skirts and do whatever they want and no less of a man. They may be effeminate but their still a man. Women can wear a suit and have short hair and be no less of a woman. When someone did cave to gender expectations labels started being made to describe them better, however  it does change ones gender you can't do that. You should be able to dress freely however. And as an American who acknowledges freedom of speech will happily use your preferred pronoun. It isn't a big deal or a bother to acknowledge that using their preferred pronouns make them more comfortable and it's would be disrespectful if my name was frank I told it was frank and you call me sarah.it calling somebody out of their name in a way to rile up emotions unnecessarily.
I'm very willing/excited to hear why some of you believe gender is a spectrum or their is more than two. I come with no intention to be rude or mean I may argue a point but that is exactly why I'm posting this to start a conversation.  I hope if you respond we can be civil and polite. If you disagree with anything I have said. Please explain why however short or long you would like to post"

what's the right age,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family it's Dad checking in hoping everyone had a great day hope you have a great weekend planned. I just want you to remember I love you I support you and you are very valid.

I've had a lot of people ask me this question and I've seen it posted in some other places and it's two different questions but they kind of go hand-in-hand. And the first question is how young is too young to know whether or not you're any part of the lgbtqia and the other question is I have younger family members how do I know if they're too young to come out to. To answer the first question you know when you know so for some people they might be 40 before they figure it out for others they might be as young as 10 or so there really is no age for you to realize you know when you know. You don't need anybody to tell you when you're straight or hetero you don't need anybody to tell you when your lgbtqia whatever age you are that you realize it you know. The other question about having younger siblings or younger family members and you're wondering what's too young to come out to them. You would be surprised how much younger people actually know. You know your family better than I do of course but younger people nowadays with the internet and everything they have far more access to information than we ever did Growing Up So they understand and are aware of a lot more than we think. If you're still living at your parents house and you have younger siblings I would consult with your parents find out what their opinion is on whether or not you should tell them but ultimately realize this when you come out it's not going to take them long to figure out there something different and especially if your trans and changing your name they're going to know something's up so when you get ready to come out go ahead and be sure it's okay to come out to everybody at once.  Remember my DM'S are always open if you want to chat or need anything.

You should never feel guilty for who you are or who you love.  I see so many people posting about feeling guilty for being bi or gay trans etc. A majority of the time its family or religion making them feel guilty. Mainly because they don't understand lgbtqia they only know what. They've been told by churches or society. Who you love is perfectly natural nothing to be guilty of.  Therefore never be ashamed of who you are or who you love.  You deserve happiness in life just like anyone else.  You're valid and nothing changes this.  No one should ever make you feel invalid or guilty about your life.  Remember my DM'S are open if you need to talk.

Today I was out shopping with my kids.  We were looking for baby stuff getting ready for the arrival of my grandson as well as looking for us.  I was actually looking at some sweat pants and stuff in the ladies department.  Now if you've read my posts you know I fully believe clothing has no gender however departments are still labeled.  My youngest daughter has been with me when I buy feminine stuff and thinks its great how im not afraid to express myself.  My oldest daughter until today had not been with me.  She came up to me and pointed out i was shopping in the ladies department.  I told her i knew that after all im 49 years old I've been shopping before.  She then asked if i was really interested in buying the clothing i was looking at.  I took this opportunity to explain my position in clothing not having a gender and that these clothes were cuter. So why can't a man like cute things.  She was fine with it and we continued shopping.  I am very confident in what I like and don't care who knows it. It took me awhile to build that confidence and get to that point.  We all have to figure out who we are on our own.  We have to find our own style especially in the lgbtqia community.  Within our community we struggle finding our identity more than hetero people do but everyone hetero included must find their identity on their own.  Try new styles or color combination.  Try new hairstyle or colors.  Try makeup for the first time whatever it is explore do it safely but explore.  I know im a cis male with a feminine flair for certain things find what works for you.  Learn to never fear to express yourself.  Learn to love who you are.  If you're a drag queen embrace it and be the best drag queen out there.  If you're a female but love mens clothing better hell wear it be you.  My point is we're all unique embrace your uniqueness despite what others may think.  My DM'S are open if anyone needs to talk

Fuck mean people,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hello my dear family dad checking in seeing how everyone is.  I love you and support you always.

So can someone tell me why people feel the need to belittle and invalidate people especially lgbtqia people.  Take the trans community for example.  I see people all the time struggling as they transition which is not an easy task. People feel the need to deadname them or invalidate them and tell them they'll never pass.  They tell gays they're to feminine and lesbians they're to masculine as if they need to feel more isolated.  They tell bisexual people they don't exist pick a side and on and on the list goes.  My lovelies you are all valid.  Your journey is worth it.  I know it's hard to simply ignore these people but if we give them attention they simply rob our joy.  Know that your sexuality and gender are real its not something you dreamed up and its not going away.  Its a part of who you are.  Be proud despite the critics rock your true self when you come out as trans.  Worry about being you and not if you pass because there's all types of men and women.  All shapes sizes etc. and they're all beautiful in their own right.  Don't let fear stop you from reaching your goals.  My DM'S are always open if you need to talk.

Idk bi or gay,Throway-deletingsoon,ainbow,"Im very confused abt my sexuality. Ive come to conclusion  Im not straight but idk if Im bi or gay. In the past Ive thought I was gay and everything but still flirted with girls, got boners/ little reactions in my pants. I think its bc I didnt know of a bi label when I was little. This would  conclude Im bi but I get gay panic, omg are they gonna find out Im gay. 

Nowadays Im pretty attracted to both, I can notice women on the street and I get tingles in my pants and think of relationships with them but Ive never done it. I never thought of a relationship with a guy b4 tho. Sometimes i wonder if Im forcing myself to like these girls, I even had fears of not watching porn bc I thought I would lose the attraction to girls.  My friend told me to hu with this girl that liked me and I chickened out. I had thoughts like Im gay I cant do this  there gonna find out Im gay what if I dont like the sex. When my friends talk abt girls I feel out of place even though Im attracted to these girls. I get nervous around pretty girls too. I panic when my parents ask me if I have a gf and yet I want one. It feels like Im a closeted gay. 

  Guys out there are talking about girls and I cant relate. I watch mostly lesbian porn and am attracted to only fem men. I get confused bc I think things like am I watching girls bc they are fem like fem men. I have low confidence and girls arent interested in me but I still get told im good looking. Ive never went past flirting with a girl bc im confused of whats gonna happen next.

I often think that the attraction I have to girls is me not accepting Im gay and that its all fake. Sometimes Ill be reading things and my brain Ill see words likes finding out, accepting, Come out, denial and my brain puts focus on to me being gay or finding out that I am. But recently a female crush got with a friend and I felt heartbroken and jealous. I never made a move on her.

Maybe I think Im gay out of low experience, confidence and being shy with girls. Idk what to do I want a gf but Im not sure. Maybe Im gay and in denial. Reddit Id like ur help on what I should do, ho to be sure of things.

TLDR: think Im gay and in denial, gay panic, nervous with girls and dont relate when guys talk about girls while still being into those girls. Idk bi or gay."

I'm in my second year of high school, an out and proud he/they/she bisexual enby, and I joined my school's GSA a few weeks back. So many people have been showing up that the classroom is constantly packed tight, and I absolutely love it. On the first day we were given a Discord link, and I've been intermittently messaging on it and reading everyone's introduction paragraphs, and Ive realized just how many other kids in the club are single and want a partner - or two - and holy shit do I want to do something about it. I want to date someone so, so badly, and here I am with all these other kids like me who also want to date, and....I don't know where to even start. 

 Since middle school, l've wanted so badly to date a girl, have a girlfriend, be in a relationship in general, to the point where now that I'm back in physical school after a year of online classes, the overwhelming desire to have a s/o sometimes makes it impossible to function during class. And I can't do anything about it, because the few girls I've had crushes on were only interested in masculine presenting/aligned people and turned me down. And now I've got all these options, a bunch of very attractive kids my age who all know what l'm going through and have probably been through it, who understand me and feel the same way as me and who     , and I'm kind of overwhelmed. 

I recognize that starting a relationship at my age, while Im this desperate, may not be the best idea, and I dont want to rush into something without getting to know the person (people, maybe) first. But Im just.Im so tired of waiting. 

I'm here looking for advice, or maybe comfort, if anyone is willing to provide."

2. How should I tell him that when I can build up enough courage to tell him that I love him. Would it be better if I tell him first that I am gay or should I not tell him personally, but write it to him via whats app

i don't even kmow if he is giving me signals. maybe i just don't see them.

Is it normal to feel like I don't want to be LGBTQ+ anymore.,LazuliArtz,ainbow,"God, this probably makes me seem like such an asshole.

It's just.... I'm tired of worrying about how my family will treat me, I'm tired of the constant threat of being harassed in the bathroom. I'm tired of feeling like I have to stand up for a whole community when it takes every ounce of my energy to stand up and be comfortable for myself.

A part of me wants to just go back to being a straight cis girl. At least then I didn't have to worry about being disowned, or assaulted for my sexuality. 

And it makes me feel like maybe I'm not LGBTQ. Maybe I really am just following a trend. Maybe I don't deserve to be apart of this community about loving myself if I just can't love myself for who I am.

Sorry about this rant, I just... Have a lot of complicated feeling about all this. I don't know if it just stems from internalized homophobia from growing up in a conservative family, or if this is just a normal part of coming to terms with who I am."

So I was out shopping yesterday with my oldest daughter who is pregnant.  We were talking about my future grandson and looking at baby clothing etc.  She said her son was going to play sports like baseball or football.  I said what if wants to cheer or do drama to which she was fine what she was actually trying to say is she didn't want him staying inside she wanted him to be active.  Then I asked what if he says they are actually a she.  She would be supportive she said but admitted she didn't fully understand the trans community.  I told her I think a lot of people are dysphoric about something.  For me I hate body hair on me but I can't shave everything because I can't reach my back and can't afford waxing but im ok with that.  Trans people however are 100 times worse because they are in the wrong body.  Imagine having to use your opposite hand because yours is broke.  Its awkward and weird and just not you.  Trans people are constantly seeing themselves in a body that's not them its awkward to see and be comfortable in.  Now I know that's a very simplified explanation but I couldn't imagine what it would be like being trapped in the wrong body.  It did help her understand though.  There are feminine things I like but I don't feel like a woman.  Its ok for men to like feminine things and women to like masculine things that alone doesn't make you trans.  If however you feel disgusted with your body etc. then you maybe trans. Regardless I got her to understand she needs to be open that just because he's born male he may not be.  My DM'S are open if you need to chat.

So I was at wal-mart today I was wearing rainbow Crocs please don't judge lol shorts and a rainbow tie dye shirt.  When I walked in the greeter snickered and said wow another one they're everywhere.  Now normally I let that roll off my back and don't say anything but I just couldn't today.  So I turned around and said excuse me.  She tried to back track because she didn't think I heard her.  I said yes I am bi leaning more to gay but you can't make assumptions like that based on how someone is dressed.  Yes there are a lot of us out there more than you think and you don't have to agree with us but you don't have to express it every time you see one of us.  We have a right to live our lives without interference just like you do and I'll be damned if I'm just going to let comments slide anymore.  She was speechless so I continued shopping.  You know I realized in that moment for me remaining silent condones that behavior it gives people like her silent permission to continue.  We as a community must realize we don't have to accept that we don't have to be quiet.  We can stand up for ourselves and others.  So never be ashamed to admit your lgbtqia+ there is no shame in it.  Do not put yourself in harms way for anything but you never need to be ashamed.  My DM'S are open if you need to talk.

Thoughts on femboy culture,merinis,ainbow,"I was thinking about femboy's today, and I guess sorta just the culture surrounding it. One of the things I've noticed as I observe and tentatively participate in the whole femboy ""thing"", is that its very common to come across a picture of someone calling themselves a femboy, or posting to a femboy sub, or whatever, and be covering their face somehow or wearing a mask. It's convenient, and masks they can make great accessories, but I wonder if this is because they're worried about being found by peers/family, or if its something else. It's not particularly hard for a guy to build an androgynous or even outright feminine body if they have something to work with, or at least my own experiences and what I've seen online seem to trend towards that being the case. Good cloths, cardio-leaning workouts, posture, good skin care, diet, etc, can move the needle significantly. However, I don't think it's just the whole, ""I don't wanna get found out"" thing. There's basically micro-celebrities on the various internet platforms that have posted their faces, but they still do lots of covered/headless shots when they do their femboy pictures, and I think it's because of a general feeling that being able to see the face will jar the audience out of the femboy aesthetic. You can't really cardio masculine facial features away, and most of these people dont have the benefit of hormones because they're typically not MtF trans (again in my experience). I don't want to make too many assumptions, but it seems they're mostly gay or bi, or an enby, or something like that.


So, I wonder what can like be done about that, and I feel like on some level the only way to get that whole ""face breaking the illusion"" worry to go away is either to plow through it or ignore it, depending on your take. To just do it with your face, and normalize it. In my mind, this issue comes down to gender norms; the face wouldn't break that illusion if there didn't *have* to be an illusion. Example, the first time I saw a guy with painted nails or a skirt, I noticed it and it visually looked like a clash, like he was breaking the visual rules. After that first time though, I was over it and it was normal, just like anyone else wearing those things, and now I do. I guess what I'm trying to come AAAALLL the way around to say is...I really wish more femboys would just show their faces, so we can get over that mental hurdle together, and genuinely normalize it. I'm all about breaking down existing gender norms, and I think people will benefit from it.

Two pieces of advice for unicorn hunters,ruchenn,ainbow,"## Two pieces of advice for unicorn hunters

1. Stop harassing women on dating apps and in real-life.

2. Hire a professional.

### the advice expanded

Yes, unicorns^1 exist. But, like their namesakes in myth and legend, bisexual women interested in threesomes with relative strangers are rare.

And the vast majority of bisexual women **who are not unicorns** and who are just trying to meet someone (on dating apps) or who are just trying to go about their day (in real-life) are beyond weary of being seen as objects (even if theoretically desirable ones).^2

Unicorn hunters impose a fantasy on the world and forget they are looking for a person. And, the essential futility of the quest aside, this is a complete ethics failure. Unicorn hunting fails the **would kindergarteners accept this** behaviour test. It fails the **dont be a dick** test.

But, unicorn hunting as ethical failure aside, hiring a professional has benefits of its own.

Most people are sub-par at sexual communication, especially in the US. Formal sex education is awful; formal sexuality education is non-existent; and the default alternatives (internet porn and ill-informed peers) make things worse.

People are not great at communicating with the people they are actually being intimate with. Navigating and negotiating with a third-party they dont know well is something most people are not up to.

A professional sex worker obviates this: they do the navigating and negotiating for you. They may not like the baggage you bring, or your bullshit assumptions. But they know your baggage and your bullshit all too well and they can drag you past it and make what you actually want crystal clear.

And not just for your sake. Indeed, mainly for theirs. People who are good at performing intimacy are generally also good at communicating and setting boundaries. The two are intimately linked (pun intended).

Im not in the US. And where I am, sex work is decriminalised.^3 So my direct knowledge is not perfectly transferable. Nonetheless, in my home state, many sex workers make being the third for couples a specific service offering.

If adding a third person is on your sexual wish list, a professional is an ethical way of making that wish come true.

### nonetheless, check yourself first

Before making a booking, interrogate yourself, especially if you are the straight woman in the hiring pair.

When I interviewed several dozen sex workers (across genders) for an article on this specific subject some years ago,^4 two things kept coming up:

1. Way too many of the women in the hiring couple were clearly not
   enthusiastic about the whole thing. (Patriarchal heteronormativity
   is fucking awful.)

2. Way too many of the men in the hiring couple were clearly not
   enthusiastic when their wives/girlfriends actually got in to the
   whole thing and said men suddenly felt like third-wheels.
   (Patriarchal heteronormativity is really fucking awful.)^5

NB: I also got multiple accounts of appointments going really well. When both people were in to the whole idea, the addition of a professional helps in so many ways. The professionals experience and skill gets things going and keep things flowing. And those same professional skills also work to get clients through in-the-moment problems like jealousy, fear, shyness, and anxiety.

If a threesome is something you want, a quality professional is almost certainly the safest and best way of making your first such experience as good as possible.

### on the basic ethics of threesomes and objectification

Threesomes are an incredibly common fantasy. And whatever your heart dreams up is fine. You cant hurt anyone else in your imagination.

But, at the core of most such fantasies, is sexual objectification. Whether its one persons fantasy or a couples fantasy, the third partys place in that fantasy is, mostly, to be a willing and available source of pleasure.

And that can absolutely be a fine thing. The complementary fantasy to this sort of threesome dream is also quite common. *I am, at least for this little while, an object of ultimate desire and utter pleasure.* Whether that object is worshipped or made use of or a complex mix of both, there are many who fantasise like this. Moreover, when you frame this as being, if only momentarily, free of all worries and cares; as a way of being entirely concerned with pleasure, it makes perfect sense as a fantasy.

But being about nothing but desire and pleasure is a vulnerable-making fantasy. To allow yourself to be entirely about being desirable and desired, means placing serious trust in the hands of those doing the desiring.

Which is why a professional is a good idea. Sex work is, at its base, the performance of intimacy and desire. And just as a good actor is completely in their performance on stage or screen, a good sex worker is completely in their performance in their place of work. They arent faking it, because performance isnt about faking, its about making the pretend real.

But, and again as with good actors, good sex workers know they are performing and, consequently, know how to keep the performance safe for themselves and their clients.

Sex workers still have to trust their clients. But they are much better than novices at knowing when to stop performing/trusting and when to start advocating on their behalf, or on behalf of another.^6

### finally, for those who insist on going it alone (so to speak)

If you are still insistent on going with a non-professional,^7 at least follow Erika Moens and Matthew Nolans advice from their 2014 comic, [How to rock a threeway](https://ohjoysextoy.com/threesomes/).

Moen and Nolan dont explicitly say dont go unicorn hunting but the be respectful and communicate frankly and honestly theme of the whole piece makes unicorn hunting an impossibility by default.

Put another way, Moen and Nolan make the point that, to bring a third in to your bedroom by yourself, you must take on all the logistics; all the practical setup; and all the emotional labour.

Because you cant be a unicorn hunter and a decent person at the same time. To do this yourself and stay on the right side of the *decent person | utter tool* divide, you have to be a *find the right person and make the entire experience right for them* hunter.

Which is a lot of work and which, for me at least, makes hiring a professional all the more compelling.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

1. A unicorn is a bisexual woman interested in being the 3rd person for
   an MF couple seeking FMF, MFF, or both, sex.^8

   The term can also denote any bisexual person willing to indulge
   the bring a third person into the bedroom fantasy of any couple.
   This usage is, at least so far as I can determine, rare.

2. Lesbians also gets these fantasies imposed on them. Because all
   sexuality is ultimately about the male gaze apparently. &lt;heavy
   fucking sigh&gt;.

3. This means its regulated like all other labour, rather than being
   subject to sex-workspecific laws.

4. Not published in English.

5. This isnt the indicator of straight women being queerer than they
   realised you might think it is.

   The consensus opinion of the women I interviewed was that a few of
   their female clients in these scenarios did experience a bisexual
   awakening of sorts. Most, however, were simultaneously delighted by
   their orgasms and anxious to get their partners doing what the sex
   worker had done.

   Because the orgasms were great, but they couldnt get into the idea
   of a woman being the source of said greatness. As one interviewee
   put it, she could tell the straight women because *theyd close
   their eyes and imagine it was their husband down there, finally
   getting it right; also, they always balked at reciprocating.*

6. If you read this as arguing for sex work decriminalisation, you
   read correctly.

   Id argue further, however. Its just as important to
   de-marginalise sex work, so that anyone performing such labour has
   unfettered access to structures that protect their labour rights
   and personal safety.

   And a social narrative that appreciates sex works complexity
   constitutes an effective way of de-marginalising.

   And, as with other pink-collared workforces (nurses come to mind),
   one effective way of improving pink-collared work is to
   professionalise the occupation. For better or worse (Id argue
   mostly for worse, but thats a different discussion), status
   accrues to roles and tasks that look white-collar. So, Ive used
   professional language above to, if only for this piece, put sex
   workers into white-collar space.

   Its a demarginalising strategy. Moreover, when you consider
   intimacy as labour, it seems obvious, to me at least, that this
   work **is** professional in scope and seriousness, and should be
   valued as such. (And, yes, we should also ask why we value things
   this way, but thats a further different discussion.)

7. Performance not being fake notwithstanding, theres a
   pre-occupation with authenticity that convinces many that hiring
   a professional in circumstances like this makes the experience
   somehow lesser.

8. *FMF* is a 3-person sexual encounter in which both women (F) engage
   with the man but not each other. *MFF* is a 3-person sexual
   encounter in which the man and one of the women engage with the
   other woman, but the woman who engages with the other woman does
   not engage with the man.^9

   My interview sample (n=45) was too small to safely generalise from,
   but almost all the women I interviewed said straight couples who
   hired them engaged them for both FMF and MFF services. That is,
   they were hired to be intimate with both the man and the woman.

   And, yes, this short-hand is reductively binary. It pre-dates
   emerging language by decades.

What's normal,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey everyone dad here checking in seeing how everyone is.  Remember I love you and support you.


So what is normal.  I spent my childhood wondering why I was bisexual.  Why I couldn't be normal. I was told be attracted as a male to anyone other than female was wrong.  Society and religion had everyone convinced that anything other than hetero was wrong.  Now both have proven to be mistaken but that makes a kid feel like there's something inside that must be broken. It took me awhile to realize being bi or gay or lesbian etc. didn't mean I was abnormal.  Normal is different for everyone and your sexuality or gender don't determine if you're normal or not.  I've been watching a show on HBOmax called Generation and there's a character in it Nathan who is bi and his parents are upset that he's not normal.  It made me realize that society and religion is the one who looks at us as abnormal and makes us feel wrong for who we love.  You are perfectly normal your sexuality my sexuality your gender my gender all normal.  Just because society for all of existence chose to sweep it under the rug and not talk about does not make us strange.  So be proud of who you are society can't silence us any longer.  Be proud of who you love.Paint your nails wear makeup dress how you're comfortable just be you.  We shouldn't have to be afraid to be ourselves i know unfortunately not all households are lgbtqia friendly just remember My DM'S are open if you need to talk.

Can you debunk these anti-anal claims?,OvenInteresting1991,ainbow,"There is too much stigma attached to anal sex. Even among some gay men, it is called ""the most dangerous hobby"". There are [http://man2manalliance.org/](http://man2manalliance.org/) and [http://g0ys.org/](http://g0ys.org/) websites promoting the idea that anal sex is not pleasurable and not worth it because it is the riskiest sexual activity and requires unnecessarily long preparation. G0ys, as they call themselves, are generally anti-anal.

Gynecologist explains anal sex is ""dangerous"": [https://www.health.com/sex/is-anal-sex-dangerous](https://www.health.com/sex/is-anal-sex-dangerous)

[https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Gynecologist-Advice-Anal-Sex-44930814](https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Gynecologist-Advice-Anal-Sex-44930814)

&gt;Lets face it, the anus was not made for intercourse. Its supposed to be a one-way passage, Dr. Streicher points out. The vagina, on the other hand, has a thick, elastic, accordion-like lining designed to stretch to accommodate a penis, or a baby.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rectal tissue is thinner and doesnt share the same elasticity, so theres a greater chance it can tear, says Dr. Streicher, who is the author of Sex Rx. And tearing increases your odds of contracting a sexually transmitted infection.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rectal gonorrhea, anal chlamydia, and HIV are all real risks. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior for HIV infections."" But anal sex is perhaps most likely to transmit the human papillomavirus (HPV). Very few men have HIV, but over half of men have HPV, says Dr. Streicher. HPV can lead to anal warts and anal cancer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then theres pain, bleeding, and fecal incontinence. Poop in your pants is not a nice thing to talk about, says Dr. Streicher. She points to new research from a team at Northwestern University that found that women who considered anal part of their regular bedroom behavior were more likely to say it changed the consistency of their stools, and report both urinary and fecal incontinence.

Is anal sex pleasurable? Where is the evidence that anal sex is physically pleasurable? And are the few minutes of pleasure worth the long preparation and risk of diseases?

There is a risk of incontinence, fissures, loose rectum and anus, STDs, anal and rectum cancer, and other things.

Why would the pleasure be worth it?

I don't know if there are any sources debunking these claims. If you know, please share them with me.

From man2manalliance and g0y: [https://imgur.com/7B0kPqm](https://imgur.com/7B0kPqm)

&gt;The anus is not designed to be invaded. It contains feces and heaps of E Coli bacteria. Its an exit point for toxic waste, not an entry point for Willy Wiener.  
&gt;  
&gt;Women develop urinary tract infections because their anuses are a very short distance from the opening of their urethras. E Coli does that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The g0ys are challenging the anal ethic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because G0YS, -by our very nature, find the entire notion of Anal Sex in any form to be dirty, dangerous, degrading &amp; damn-un-masculine; -By shunning casual sexual encounters &amp; completely rejecting AnalSex, G0YS avoid the very perils that spread +98% of ALL STI's/STD's among men! Among g0ys, STDs/STIs are virtually nonexistent compared to the STD/STI figures for the GAY-male community (which, according to the Red Cross - is +4000% higher than the general population)! So, while ""GAY""-men are plagued with STDs/STIs; - G0YS are NOT!  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The erotic pleasure in anal penetration is so minimal, and, when joined with promiscuity, the dangers anal presents to its practitioners and the community so great, that it's difficult to conceive of a practice more ruinous or less enjoyable taking center place in a sexual subculture.  
&gt;  
&gt;These dangers, of which HIV/AIDS is the best known, but which include hepatitis B and C, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, the human papilloma virus, herpes, and a host of other pathogens, will persist even after AIDS has been cured or can be prevented through vaccination.  
&gt;  
&gt;And more anally-transmitted diseases most certainly await discovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;For anal penetration is an exceptionally efficient mode of disease transmission, and we can be sure that pathogens will continue to find an infective niche in anal.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, no magic or wishful thinking can transform either the anus or the rectum into genital organs, nor can the feelings experienced by someone being penetrated anally be compared to those of genital stimulation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, anal penetration subjugates one of the participants to the other, effectively emasculating him, turning him into a pseudo-woman, a proxy in a heterosexualized form of contact. This is an inherently unequal act, epitomized by its tedious terminology of ""tops"" and ""bottoms,"" which is unmindful of the basic human need for a shared experience without pain and with dignity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whereas Frot, phallus-against-phallus contact, is the acme of sexual activity between Men because it's focused on that which makes Men Masculine, namely their genitals -- their Manhood -- rather than their organs of fecal excretion.  
&gt;  
&gt;To draw a parallel with man-woman sex: Men and Women connect to one another genitally. They are made that way, like counterweights or puzzle pieces, complementary of one another. In the same way, during phallus-to-phallus sexual activity, Men are related to one another as they should be, in that part of their body that fits together genitally and sensually.  
&gt;  
&gt;For a Man and a Woman sex is a naturally penetrative act. For two Men the natural experience is that which stimulates both of them phallically -- not anally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Neither the anus nor the rectum are genitalia, period.  
&gt;  
&gt;This continuing denigration of healthy, loving, and innately Masculine sexual intimacy is a result of ignorance and prejudice, and the Men of the Alliance are committed to exposing and defeating both.

I sense misogyny when they claim a man who ""bottoms"" in anal sex becomes less of a man, a ""pseudo-woman"", and that anal penetration is inherently unequal making the ""bottom"" less than, and degrading, humiliating and demeaning the ""bottom"".

And there's a subreddit dedicated to these people who are against anal sex: [https://old.reddit.com/r/g0ys/comments/edkcko/side\_is\_the\_new\_g0y/fdga0ad/](https://old.reddit.com/r/g0ys/comments/edkcko/side_is_the_new_g0y/fdga0ad/)

&gt;You're right that nothing is truly harmless. Even frot and mutual masturbation has theoretical risks.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, I call them harmless because that risk is low enough to be negligible.  
&gt;  
&gt;As such, there's no anal activity that comes close to frot, mutual masturbation, and other like acts in being low-risk. Yes, there are certain anal acts that pose relatively less risk compared with other anal acts. Having said that, in the big picture, any kind of anal play is high-risk. They might vary slightly in intensity of their risk, but they are all objectively high risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; *""Fecal matter is almost omnipresent in human spaces.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Thats true. However, the concentration of that matter is different. The concentration and number of fecal bacteria on a table or door handle will always be lower than the bacterias source (the anus).  
&gt;  
&gt;Doing anal play safely takes lots of preparation and precaution. It takes far more effort than vaginal sex, and certainly much more than frot.  
&gt;  
&gt;If it takes so much energy to make safe, when does the precaution needed become absurd? When exactly does the preparation needed become too ridiculous to be practical?  
&gt;  
&gt;Most importantly, if that preparation is too extensive to make sense, is the act worth doing to begin with

i have a few questions on ""she/her"" vs ""she/they"". i apologize in advance if any sound rude or if im using the wrong terminology (correct me please):

&amp;#x200B;

1. what does ""she/they"" and ""they/she"" mean exactly (like how is it different from someone who uses ""she/her""? are people who use ""she/they"" pronouns typically non-binary or can anyone use them?
2. does ""she/they"" and ""they/she"" mean the person uses both ""she/her"" and ""they/them"" pronouns, and you can address them as either pronoun? or are you supposed to use both, and if yes, how? smth like ""sarah said her phone was broken and they were going to get it repaired"" ?
3. does the placement of the words make a difference between which pronouns to use? like does someone who uses ""she/they"" prefer ""she"" as the main pronoun, but will accept ""they"" too? and vice versa, someone who uses ""they/she"" prefer ""they"" as the main pronoun but will accept ""she"" too?

thank you!!!"

Can you debunk these anti-anal claims? Is there evidence that anal sex is physically pleasurable? Where is the evidence? And why would the pleasure of anal sex be worth the risks?,OvenInteresting1991,ainbow,"There is too much stigma attached to anal sex. Among some gay men, it is called ""the most dangerous hobby"". There are [http://man2manalliance.org/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210817151820/https://male2male.com/) and [http://g0ys.org/](http://g0ys.org/) websites promoting the idea that anal sex is not pleasurable and not worth it because it is the riskiest sexual activity and requires unnecessarily long preparation. G0ys, as they call themselves, are generally anti-anal.

Is anal sex pleasurable? Where is the evidence that anal sex is physically pleasurable? And are the few minutes of pleasure worth the long preparation and risk of diseases? Why would the pleasure be worth it?

I don't know if there are any sources debunking these claims. If you know, please share them with me.

&gt;The anus is not designed to be invaded. It contains feces and heaps of E Coli bacteria. Its an exit point for toxic waste, not an entry point for Willy Wiener.  
&gt;  
&gt;Women develop urinary tract infections because their anuses are a very short distance from the opening of their urethras. E Coli does that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The g0ys are challenging the anal ethic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because G0YS, -by our very nature, find the entire notion of Anal Sex in any form to be dirty, dangerous, degrading &amp; damn-un-masculine; -By shunning casual sexual encounters &amp; completely rejecting AnalSex, G0YS avoid the very perils that spread +98% of ALL STI's/STD's among men! Among g0ys, STDs/STIs are virtually nonexistent compared to the STD/STI figures for the GAY-male community (which, according to the Red Cross - is +4000% higher than the general population)! So, while ""GAY""-men are plagued with STDs/STIs; - G0YS are NOT!  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The erotic pleasure in anal penetration is so minimal, and, when joined with promiscuity, the dangers anal presents to its practitioners and the community so great, that it's difficult to conceive of a practice more ruinous or less enjoyable taking center place in a sexual subculture.  
&gt;  
&gt;These dangers, of which HIV/AIDS is the best known, but which include hepatitis B and C, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, the human papilloma virus, herpes, and a host of other pathogens, will persist even after AIDS has been cured or can be prevented through vaccination.  
&gt;  
&gt;And more anally-transmitted diseases most certainly await discovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;For anal penetration is an exceptionally efficient mode of disease transmission, and we can be sure that pathogens will continue to find an infective niche in anal.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, no magic or wishful thinking can transform either the anus or the rectum into genital organs, nor can the feelings experienced by someone being penetrated anally be compared to those of genital stimulation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, anal penetration subjugates one of the participants to the other, effectively emasculating him, turning him into a pseudo-woman, a proxy in a heterosexualized form of contact. This is an inherently unequal act, epitomized by its tedious terminology of ""tops"" and ""bottoms,"" which is unmindful of the basic human need for a shared experience without pain and with dignity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whereas Frot, phallus-against-phallus contact, is the acme of sexual activity between Men because it's focused on that which makes Men Masculine, namely their genitals -- their Manhood -- rather than their organs of fecal excretion.  
&gt;  
&gt;To draw a parallel with man-woman sex: Men and Women connect to one another genitally. They are made that way, like counterweights or puzzle pieces, complementary of one another. In the same way, during phallus-to-phallus sexual activity, Men are related to one another as they should be, in that part of their body that fits together genitally and sensually.  
&gt;  
&gt;For a Man and a Woman sex is a naturally penetrative act. For two Men the natural experience is that which stimulates both of them phallically -- not anally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Neither the anus nor the rectum are genitalia, period.  
&gt;  
&gt;This continuing denigration of healthy, loving, and innately Masculine sexual intimacy is a result of ignorance and prejudice, and the Men of the Alliance are committed to exposing and defeating both.

I sense misogyny when they claim a man who ""bottoms"" in anal sex becomes less of a man, a ""pseudo-woman"", and that anal penetration is inherently unequal making the ""bottom"" less than, and degrading, humiliating and demeaning the ""bottom"".

And there's a subreddit dedicated to these people who are against anal sex: [https://old.reddit.com/r/g0ys/comments/edkcko/side\_is\_the\_new\_g0y/fdga0ad/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210817151820/https://old.reddit.com/r/g0ys/comments/edkcko/side_is_the_new_g0y/fdga0ad/)

&gt;You're right that nothing is truly harmless. Even frot and mutual masturbation has theoretical risks. However, I call them harmless because that risk is low enough to be negligible.  
&gt;  
&gt;As such, there's no anal activity that comes close to frot, mutual masturbation, and other like acts in being low-risk. Yes, there are certain anal acts that pose relatively less risk compared with other anal acts. Having said that, in the big picture, any kind of anal play is high-risk. They might vary slightly in intensity of their risk, but they are all objectively high risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; *""Fecal matter is almost omnipresent in human spaces.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Thats true. However, the concentration of that matter is different. The concentration and number of fecal bacteria on a table or door handle will always be lower than the bacterias source (the anus).  
&gt;  
&gt;Doing anal play safely takes lots of preparation and precaution. It takes far more effort than vaginal sex, and certainly much more than frot.If it takes so much energy to make safe, when does the precaution needed become absurd? When exactly does the preparation needed become too ridiculous to be practical?  
&gt;  
&gt;Most importantly, if that preparation is too extensive to make sense, is the act worth doing to begin with?

Is sex supposed to be so risky? When does the risk become absurd?Even ""gay"" doctors (as mentioned in the M2M Alliance article) say that there's no physiological basis for anal orgasm.  
&gt;  
&gt;From the M2M Alliance link, as it quotes a ""gay"" doctor: ""Most of the nerve endings that sense pleasure are at the outside of your anus or within the first two inches. The rest of your rectum and colon do not have nerves that sense pleasure. While many will disagree with me, there is no physiological basis for most of the pleasure you derive higher up in your colon. There is definitely a psychological pleasure.""

"What are the arguments against ""two men or two women can not complement each other""?",OvenInteresting1991,ainbow,"I wanted to ask on askphilosophy, but the bot removed my post. This has to do with gay relationships, and I'm posting here instead:

The subjects are yin and yang and complementarianism. 

Both complementarianism and yin and yang have something in common: they claim opposite, conflicting things/forces complement each other - ""darkness and light, man and woman, complement each other"" for instance.

The yin, or the dark side, is associated with everything dark, hard, negative, cold, wet, and ""feminine"".

The yang, or the light side, is associated with everything light, soft, positive, warm, dry, and ""masculine"", and yet yin and yang claims up and down, light and dark, water and fire, softness and hardness, dryness and wetness, ""masculinity"" and ""femininity"", complement and depend on each other, that they can't exist without one another, which makes them complementary.

Apparently, similar, identical things/forces can not be complementary. Light can not complement light. Darkness can not complement darkness. Water can not complement water. Fire can not complement fire. A woman can not complement a woman. A man can not complement a man. ""Femininity"" can not complement ""femininity"". And ""masculinity"" can not complement ""masculinity"". 

I have seen yin and yang and complementarianism be used by homophobic individuals. ""Two women or two men go against nature and can not complement each other"", ""men and women are different, that's why they complement each other. A woman provides qualities a man does not have. Two women can't provide qualities each don't have and their relationship is neither useful, nor complementary"", or ""masculine energy needs feminine energy. Two masculine energies can not connect"", they claim.

Reminds me of the electrons and protons, and the positive and negative sides of magnets. Two electrons can't be connected. Two positive sides of a magnet can't be connected. They become separated, while an electron and a proton can be connected, and the positive and negative sides of a magnet can be connected.

Are there any arguments against the claims and analogies presented above?

How can two men or two women complement each other, when similar, identical things/forces can not be complementary? For things to be complementary, they should be the opposite of each other. And two men or two women are not the opposite of each other."
Be proud,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family it's dad checking in hoping you're all having a great weekend. As always remember I love you and support you and you are very valid.


So today I want to talk to you about being proud. About accepting who you are and not being ashamed of it. There have always been people in our lives to think we should be ashamed for being lgbtqia. They try to make us feel unnormal unloved and Unworthy of acceptance. I want you to know we are worthy of acceptance who you choose to love is your decision your feet no one else's. And you should never feel ashamed for who you love everyone deserves love. If two men two women a man and a woman a man and non-binary whatever  pick your pair doesn't matter if they are in love then whose business is it to tell them that they're not normal. You should never be ashamed of being bisexual lesbian gay transgender asexual whatever it is your life and no one else. You deserve to be happy and you deserve to love to make you happy. So never be ashamed of Who You Are always be proud that doesn't mean it's going to be easy it doesn't mean you may have to be in the closet for a little while but never be ashamed of Who You Are you're not weird you're not abnormal you are you and that in and of itself is beautiful.  My DM'S are open if you need to talk.

Is it correct to be suspicious/distrustful of straight people who seek out threesomes with bi people? I always fear that they're using bi people to fulfill a preexisting fantasy they have but they might personally be LGBT-phobic.,PresidentJoeManchin,ainbow,"Sorry if this might be an inappropriate question for the sub. 

I think part of it is that mainstream sex comedies have sort of ruined the idea of straight-bi sex for me, where every woman in the movie happens to be bi and willing to do bi stuff for straight men. I dunno, something about it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm straight btw. And to some extent there are straight women with similar fantasies toward bi men. Regardless, I always have a weird feeling that some of these straight folk who have these kind of fantasies about bi people might not be that friendly to LGBT folk. They might be eager to have sex with two bi men or two bi women, but would they be okay with being friends with gay men, lesbian women, trans people, nonbinary people, etc.? Because if not, then they're just using bi people as sex objects. If they can prove they aren't LGBT-phobic, then I wouldn't be distrustful. At least that's how I'd feel if I were bi. 

I say this cause I've personally known homophobic straight people who openly fantasize about having sex with multiple bi people. I think that if I was bi and was interested in dating or having sex with a straight person(s), I'd want them to prove that they aren't LGBT-phobic first.

I'm not inherently against straight-bi orgies though, just wanna make that clear. I'm just saying some straight people go about it in a shitty way (I'm looking at you, unicorn hunters)."

Great parent,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hello my wonderful family dad checking in here hoping everyone had a great day. I hope you know and remember that you are loved and so very special.

There's a couple things I'd like to talk about today the first one before I get really started on anyting is I've seen quite a few people wondering because they watch a certain type of porn if it makes them gay bi lesbian Etc. It is my personal opinion only that porn in and of itself does not determine your sexuality let's face it you've got good looking people having sex It's Not Unusual to be turned on therefore I would not base my sexuality on the type of porn that you like. If you find yourself with attraction to other Sexes and genders then by all means you may be bisexual gay pansexual lesbian Etc.  Now I want to talk about a cute little story that happened yesterday when I was at Walmart. There was a lady shopping with her son who was in the girls department now the son was probably six or seven I didn't ask specifically. But he was buying dresses and other outfits people would call girly clothes. So I wanted to talk to the mom because I was very impressed by how open she was being. She said her son had come to her about a year or so ago saying that he wanted to wear girls clothes but that he was still a boy. She was open-minded enough to know that clothing does not determine gender and if that's what he wanted to wear and if that's what he felt more comfortable wearing that's what she was going to buy him.  she suspect it may have something to do with the fact that his sister has pretty clothes and she's a little older than he is and he's trying to imitate her but rather than force him to make a decision she's letting him experiment within the confines of her home and out in public. If he determined later on that he wants to go back to wearing boy clothes she is perfectly fine with it but if he determined later on that in fact he is transgender and wants to transition she's open to that as well. It was amazing talking to her she was just so open and so accepting it makes me glad to know that there are parents out there who are like that. To me it's so much better than the parent who yells at your kid and forces their kid into some societal Norm just because they're afraid of what others might say. Yes the answer to the question on everybody's mind she has talked to her son about the fact that other kids may pick on him that he may be made fun of so he needs to be prepared as long as he is okay with that she's willing to let him do what he feels he's ready for.

What is the stance on gender in languages that don't differentiate between gender and sex?,BadDogSaysMeow,ainbow,"*This question is about ""gender"" defined as a pure social construct. Not biological or part biological and societal.*

As most discussions relating to gender are done using English it is common to for them to center about the linguistic difference between gender and sex that either existed always or at least for quite some time.

  
However, in many languages there is no word for gender and language only defines sex.  
But that does not mean that there are no users of these languages who identify as non-binary.  
If the distinction between gender and sex is an important part of human psyche should it not manifest in all languages used by common people and appear in everyday speech?  
Am I missing something? It would be hard for me to believe that there were no non-binary people in countries using these languages until English influence got to them. Sadly, I lack precise historical/cultural knowledge from around the world to know how this topic was handled before current era of globalisation. 

I am a student of linguistics and such questions really interest me."

The school adopted a school uniform and the skirts were deemed girls uniforms the slacks were boys.  There was a good discussion on how clothes had no gender it was society that determined it.  That's why I encourage my kids to try what they want.  Find your style.  Who cares if you're female and dress ""masculine"" or enby and dress fluid etc.  Find what works for you.  Same goes for activities or cars etc. Who cares if it is typically one gender or another that drives it be you.  Guys can wear makeup and paint their nails.  Girls don't have to wear makeup and dresses.  Its all about being comfortable with who you are. Society is slowly catching up to the idea and so are some employers.  Don't be afraid to be yourself.

But God damn it, I want to look and admire beautiful women all day and artwork showcasing their body. I want to cuddle with a girl, hug her, put my face close to her, and criss-cross out bodies together. I know that I am romantically and sexually attracted to guys or something like that but it's not the same when it comes to beauty &amp; physical touch.

My kids and I were talking last night and they asked me what was one thing I wish I had when I came out at age 14. Not like most of you yes I wish I'd had my parents support and things like that but what I really wish I had had was some type of mentor someone who could tell me what to expect and how to handle situations that we're going to arrive. You see the lgbtqia community is harassed and bullied on a regular basis but as a kid I didn't know that. I didn't have any friends who were lgbtq or know anybody that was. I wish I had known either a family member or a friend or somebody that had been through the bullying and the harassment they could have told me what to expect and how to handle it. I wish I had had somebody that could tell me my family might reject me and how to handle it. There's so many things I didn't know. That is one of the main reasons why I post today I want you to have somebody you can turn to that you can lean on that you can text or ask questions anytime you have anything you want to know.  I want you to know that you have somebody that will support you and care about you. My DMs are always open anytime you have a question and I promise I will answer you as quickly as I can.

When did the definition of transgender change?,sorcerykid,ainbow,"Up until recently, I've always heard transgender defined as ""a person whose gender identity is different than their sex assigned at birth"".

However, last week while asking about where different gender minorities fit into the community, multiple nonbinary people were telling me that being transgender is ""a person that does not identify as their gender assigned at birth"" which is a radically different in several ways.

Where did this definition come from and why was it changed?"

Erin OToole even neglected to mention that a transgender woman is running as a Conservative Party of Canada candidate!",TaylorLakhryst,ainbow,"Watch my full UNEDITED segment [here](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1945039427527/).

See Erica Lenti's coverage as it happened [here](https://twitter.com/ericalenti/status/1437209347029884932).

I want to say that I appreciate the opportunity &amp; the visibility provided to me by CBC on an important topic. I truly appreciate the recognition &amp; gratitude from others about being a voice, knowing that I had a responsibility to represent my values while doing my best to speak in a way that represented intersectionality, as the dialogue about my lived experience could quite easily get translated into a form that represents other marginalized communities. I also feel content I wanted to say (or DID say) got removed from being heard by the rest of our country. 

As I have pointed out in many replies leading up to the event, this was not a debate-style format, and it being respectful was important. That said, I can not understate the significance of having discussion-worthy topics get swept off of the table. Thanks for that, CBC. Cool beans.

I aired my thoughts about my experience [here](https://youtu.be/c18lBoD5U-8). Bookmarks are below if you want to jump to a point.

[1:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18lBoD5U-8&amp;t=80s) \- Canada doesn't want to hear uncomfortable conversations.

[2:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18lBoD5U-8&amp;t=145s) \- Bad words and the byproduct of bigotry.

[3:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18lBoD5U-8&amp;t=225s) \- Systemic oppression.

[4:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18lBoD5U-8&amp;t=260s) \- ""Say this because it's watered down and easy to swallow,"" pretty much.

[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18lBoD5U-8&amp;t=988s) \- I did the best that I could.

For everyone who watched the segment, did you know Erin OToole neglected to mention [the Conservative Party of Canada has a transgender woman running as a candidate in Victoria, BC](https://www.conservativevictoria.ca/candidate_announcement)? I mean, Erin was more than happy to be proud of an openly gay member of the party from Ontario. Maybe its me, but I feel that taking a moment to mention her on that stage, with that opportunity, probably would have been important. I can only hope that Hannah is able to recognize where she stands in the eyes of her party leader about the topic and the meaningfulness of her visibility.

 I want to share a bit of good news I found out my daughter is going to have her gender reveal this weekend so I'll find out what gender my grandbaby is going to be. Before anybody says anything I do want you to know I understand that gender assigned at Birth an actual gender may turn out to be totally different and that's fine. Whatever the child grows up to be it will be loved and cherished regardless. You know as I think about it this child will have an opportunity that I were a lot of you didn't have enough to go up in a kind of environment where they're loved and accepted for who they want to be and who they want to love and there's no pressure or stereotypes placed upon them. I know myself and a lot of you with that your parents had raised you in an environment to where you could have expressed yourself and felt free to express yourself the way you want. This child whether male female non-binary whatever will be allowed to explore and will be allowed to grow in an environment where they're not judge. I really wish that could be the environment for everybody unfortunately there is still bigotry and things in the world that prevent that from happening. Until the world catches up with that view I am here to offer you love and acceptance and validation wherever needed my DM'S are always open if you need to chat just feel free to message me"
"Straight cis people who genderbend or crossdress, are they usually considered to be queer/LGBT by the community?",PresidentJoeManchin,ainbow,"Like straight men who frequently cross-dress. Or people who frequently wear androgynous clothing. 

I've heard some queer/LGBT describe some of that as being appropriation, especially cross-dressing. Cross-dressing is viewed by some as being disrespectful, especially when it's straight cis men cross-dressing as women. Some regard it being akin to like a minstrel show, but it's mocking women instead of black people.

Personally I don't think most cis male cross-dressers are trying to insult women. I think they just enjoy dressing that way, simple as that. They could be straight and cis but still have a feminine side that they like to express."

What has J.K. Rowling done that is transphobic/otherwise horrible?,Cherry0Blossom,ainbow,"My dad was talking to me and my older brother about watching Harry Potter movies soon. So Rowling came up. I said ""ugh I hate her"", and my dad was like ""???"".
So I very breifly told him about her being transphobic and being a horrible person, and how a large chunk of Harry Potter fans have disowned her.
I guess my dad breifly looked it up on his phone it seems and he said (paraphrasing) ""She's not transphobic, all she said is that sex is real.""
I quickly noted out of that conversation/argument, becuase I get flustered/irritated and have a hard time articulating myself. So now my dad and brother just think I'm on the ""I hate rowling"" bandwagon... which, I mean... it's true lol. BUT it's 100% justified.

So it's been awhile since I've seen anything about rowling being horrible, so I don't remember clearly enough to refute my dad and brother.

We in the lgbtqia+ community don't hear it very often because most of the time our friends and family cast us out and cast us away because of our sexual preference. But I want you to know that you do have someone who understands someone who's willing to be a parent figure for you someone who'll celebrate you in your accomplishments and cry with you when you need a shoulder to cry on. I truly love each and everyone of you I went through the same thing when I came out at 14 and I do this because I wish I had had someone who understood and who supported me and who helped me through the questions that I had.

Im a lesbian, and a cis and white passing one at that (Hispanic but white? Its confusing). And I really dont want to be one of those LGB people that just ignore trans issues, get caught up in their own plight and ignore what I could do to help.

What does it really mean to be a trans ally? How can I continue the fight when I dont have anyway to financially contribute?"

RainbowMC Minecraft Server Open // Accepting Staff Applications,Nightwielder_,ainbow,"Hello everyone!

After our poll last month, we decided to roll out a proper r/ainbow minecraft server. I have been working hard to get everything ready for you all, so I hope you enjoy--it is online as we speak. Here are a few notes about the server:

* it is in online mode
* Crossplay with bedrock is enabled! you'll need to use a separate IP and the java experience is more complete, but you are welcome to join from there
* Gameplay is PVE (**you can attack mobs, not players**)
* This is a peaceful factions server -- we use a factions plugin to claim land and prevent griefing. We also have an economy plugin and a mine world.
* Proximity and party chat are be enabled
* We have our own [discord server](https://ainbow.org/discord.html) (separate from the general r/ainbow discord and **required to play**) and [website with forums](https://ainbow.org).
* This is not a whitelisted server, but we require discord and have automoderator features to protect against trolls. Also, we have taken steps to protect against malicious attacks.
* We will have a perks store, but it is not currently active because we need to ensure we are EULA compliment and that all perks are appropriate for the price. 
* Note that we are limiting simultaneous players to 25 at this time. Once we have a feel for the resources we will need to increase this limit, we will.
* Trolls will be banned on sight.
* **Staff applications are open:** [https://forms.gle/ne7icGjVA2WRo5AW9](https://forms.gle/ne7icGjVA2WRo5AW9). We need a good team, so please apply if you are interested. We are not looking for developers or admins at this time.

I want to apologize for not being on in a while I've been having trouble with my phone and could not get in but it seems I've got it fixed now. Didn't want you to think I had forgotten you I just haven't been able to get on.

What do you do when someone blows off your sexuality or gender. In other words say you come out as gay or lesbian or whatever and somebody says oh it's just a fad or it's just a phase. How do you handle that. How do you handle it when you come out as transgender and somebody says you can't change your gender you are what you were born. People don't realize how hurtful it is to be made to feel invalid. Is there a possibility that there are those within the community who are doing it just for a fad or a face if possible sure. It is my belief however that if you tell me you're bi or gay or lesbian or trans or asexual or nonbinary or whatever I'm going to take you at face value it is not my place to determine for the that is legitimate for you or not only you know that. We need to stop making people feel invalid about their choices in life for years when I came out as bisexual I was told pick a side you can't like both but you can just like pansexual people can like people regardless of gender. We in the lgbtqia plus community have enough to worry about and fight for without having to fight for our validation. So let me say this once and for all for everybody that reads this you are valid! Your sexuality your gender whatever it is you are valid and if your sexuality and gender should change down the road no problem sexuality is fluid gender is fluid it can change your still valid. Do not feel like you have to justify the people who you are and why you believe you're that way you don't owe anybody an explanation for anything. Go out and live your life the way you believe it should be lived and to hell with everybody else. My DM's are open if anyone wants to talk I am here.

Being LGBTQ is not a fashion statement. Our pain is not something for you to wear like the hottest trend.,awinterofdiscontent7,ainbow,"At the risk of being called out for gatekeeping hear me out first. I am a 40 year old lesbian and I am happy that the world has become a more accepting place for people like us. I'm writing from a pov of a lesbian living in Asia so some perspectives might be different from elsewhere. I am most happy to be corrected if my feelings about this is wrong.

So I've been noticing a trend where some people are suddenly coming out and embracing their queerness because LGBTQ is a hot topic but then their behaviour and action says otherwise. Its almost like they are ""coming out"" because its the fashionable thing to do and what's worst it they attribute every flaw they have to ""because I'm gay"" ""the world hates me"". To me its like - ""No honey you're not queer, you're just a terrible human being using a trending topic to justify your shitty behaviour"" To makes matters worst, they base their identity solely on their perceived sexuality.

I don't know about the rest of you but here is an example (one of many I have encountered), a woman I know claims to be lesbian, does not engage with women sexually but loves to give sex tips to other lesbians. Makes being lesbian her entire identity. She's one of many I have met and honestly she and the others are feeding into what the opposition like to accuse of ""the gay agenda"".

What irritates me about this is because it paints a bad light for other queers. Also our pain of having to go through the shame of family disowning us, discrimination by society is not something to be worn like a fashion statement just because its the hot trending topic. Today its about non binary, cis gender not cis gender, they/them zir...etc I wonder what's the next hot trending issue that would be worn like fashion statement. Please tell me I am wrong."

Please as lgbt refugees in kakuma refugee camp we need your help. We are going through persecution as well as discrimination and attacks on our communities. We are a population of 200000 refugees with a percentage of 1% lgbt of the total population. We are around 1000 lgbt in kakuma refugee camp. I personally i left my country because of persecution and discrimination. I had my boyfriend from my secondary school. When i completed senior six, I decided to visit my boyfriend at his home. This took place in January 2020, his parents were not at home as they had reported back to their work! We had spent time without seeing each other so when we got a chance to meet we decided to play sex. In the process his father came back, in Uganda my country homosexuality is not allowed. This led the father to close us inside the house and called the entire neighbours and it was a cloud of people. They tied us on ropes and our balls were also loaded with heavy stones. Still up to now I have a problem with my testicles. At times they pain me because of that incidence. We were beaten by the people with a number of words including us being cursed, devil and so on. The poured petrol on us and now wanted to burn us. Some people called police and when the police came, as people dispersed for me i got a chance to run away, am sorry to say that my boyfriend never survived. When the police came at the scene and found out that we were homosexuals, it never minded about saving my boyfriend. He was killed in a lot of pain with. I decided to run to Kenya from Uganda to seek for asylum. I entered Kenya in January 2020! Then to the Red Cross which is in Kenya. Remember UNHCR was responsible for my protection so red cross handed me over to UNHCR. Unhcr brought me to Kakuma refugee camp where I found so many other lgbt like me and they faced almost the same persecution in Uganda. The camp is also full of homophobia from our fellow refugees. We decided to go to unhcr compound after we have realized unhcr was to protect us but yet then we came we were attacked every day and our life was continuing to be at risk. We went to the compound of unhcr in march and kenyan police brutalized us and they took us back to the camp. Even up to now we are attacked and every thing is not ok! We have had fire attacks on our community thrice, the first time left injuries, the second one left three with serious injuries then later on one died, and the third time every thing of ours was burnt and we also had some minor injuries. What i can say is that the situation is not ok right here. I and my family of lgbt try to get what to eat from helpers like you. 


I have a YouTube channel which has more information about the camp. Also i have a GoFundMe page when you go to about of the YouTube channel. There are also petitions and your signature helps a lot. I have Instagram, facebook and WhatsApp incase of any information you would like to know.

Need some help refuting a homophobic argument (tw: homophobia and cisnormative language),TransidentifiedOwO,ainbow,"(TL;DR at the end)

I accidentally came across this one paper by a Catholic pharmacist arguing that (especially male) homosexuality is a mental disorder (I'm not going to link it here bc I don't want anyone to go read it as self harm), but it is actually surprisingly compelling on first glance. 

Essentially he argued that homosexuality is a mental disorder even though there are high-functioning and happy gay people (i.e. it's not always a mental *illness*), because homosexual activity is misusing/abusing the sexual organs and functions (genitalia, semen, orgasm, etc.). For example, the purpose of sex is reproduction (order), so doing anything else or having the desire to do it for anything else is dysfunctional/a disorder. The function of semen is to deliver sperm to an egg cell (order), so therefore using it for something else or wanting to do so is a disorder.

There are other mental disorders, he says, where people might be perfectly content with themselves (while others aren't) and be able to function in daily life, but that alone doesn't make them not disorders. So the research on the basis of which homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness - which was that gay people could be functioning, happy adults - did not actually prove what it claimed it did.

I've been thinking about a refutation a lot but so far couldn't come up with anything that entirely satisfied me. So far I have the following:

I would split up his argument this way:

1. The evolutionary, sole purpose of orgasm is being a reward for reproducing.
2. The evolutionary, sole purpose of genitalia and related fluids is assisting with reproductive sex.
3. Not using body parts or functions for their evolutionary purpose is disordered behavior.
4. Desiring to act disordered is a mental disorder, even if this doesn't bring the person themselves any distress.
5. Conclusion: Homosexuality is a mental disorder.

I take issue with several of the premises as well as the incompleteness of the conclusion.

**Issues with the first premise:** 

* Reproduction is not the sole evolutionary purpose of sex. If this was so, evolution would have by now selected for such a design of the reproductive organs that would (almost) guarantee pregnancy with unprotected vaginal straight sex during the right time in the woman's cycle. [And yet, it takes them about 78 times on average until conception.](https://www.parents.com/getting-pregnant/trying-to-conceive/how-many-attempts-does-the-average-couple-need-to-conceive/) So, clearly, evolution must have kept sex being not that productive at reproducing for other reasons, for other benefits that are still there even if sex does not result in a pregnancy. Those could be social bonding or just stress relief (such as in our closest relatives in the animal world), which also happens with homosexual activity.
* Not only that, anal penetration for cis men (and other AMAB people) actually helps with prostate health, plus it feels good for most. If it was not the evolutionary ""purpose"" of the prostate to be stimulated as part of sexual activity, and in fact even harmful, then evolution would have long eliminated those genes that make people develop what is basically a male G-spot there, and even less so give benefits to stimulating it. 
* A similar thing could be said about female homosexuality - if evolution had wanted orgasm to only be a reward for reproduction, it would have made vaginal orgasm much easier (or almost guaranteed in the case of successful conception) than clitoral orgasm, or have eliminated clitoral orgasm altogether. Yet it didn't, and many heterosexual women report not being able to orgasm from vaginal penetration alone. Evolution not eliminating clitoral orgasm is probably because it still had benefits, such as stress relief and bonding, thereby proving once again that orgasm has several functions and was meant to be used for more than reproduction. 

**Issues with the second premise:**

* The initial evolutionary purpose of hands was for us to hunt and gather berries to survive, yet nobody would try to argue that using our hands to type or write is disordered.
* This is where I'd really like some help because I don't find my arguments here compelling enough: Does anyone have research papers or articles about alternate evolutionary functions of genitalia, semen, etc. - like with orgasm? I can't find anything and I've typed in the keywords a thousand different ways already.

**Issues with the third premise:**

* A disorder in general is usually defined as something that *disturbs* a certain order. I.e. it is not simply *different* from the order, it actively disturbs/prevents it from occurring \[note: I'm not entirely satisfied with my premise here\]. But, for example, using semen for something other than reproduction (i.e. ejaculating somewhere other than the end of the vaginal canal) does not prevent that same person from using semen for reproduction in the future.
* Therefore homosexual activity may not be the order (if we accept premise 2), but this does not make it disordered, because someone who at some point engaged in homosexual activity or is homosexual may still engage in heterosexual activity afterwards.
* What could be considered disordered by this logic is, for example, someone wanting to get rid of their fertility altogether. And that, too, only applies if we accept the second premise.

**Issues with the conclusion:**

* The conclusion is incomplete as it doesn't apply the same standards to everyone.
* Following the author's logic, any heterosexual person who does not have a breeding and pregnancy kink and does not plan on reproducing each time they have sex has a mental disorder. Somehow I don't think he'd approve of such a conclusion. Any person who ever masturbated also has a mental disorder, though granted I think he, being a Catholic, would be perfectly fine with such a conclusion.

What do you think? Any ideas for better refuting the second premise? I know I've already refuted almost everything about this argument but I want to destroy as much as possible of it so homophobes have no possibility of a logical comeback left. (Also please don't write something like ""all these institutions don't see homosexuality as a disorder anymore: \[list\]"". I know, but I'm not here because I haven't heard of appeals to authority.)

**TL;DR What are the evolutionary functions of sexual organs and fluids (semen etc.) beside reproduction? Are there any?**"

This real NOt Spam Im speaking to your Humanity,Loving_Sebring,ainbow,"I decided that my best bet is to have an open letter to send to multiple agencies throughout the lgtbq+ and legal community. I am writing this in hope that it reaches someone that can or will help me. I am a gay man i dont use my sexuality or gender as a means as an excuse for anything in my life.

I was raised old fashioned. Your word is your bond and that actions speak louder than words. I have never thought in my life before or after i came out as a gay man that i would ever be in a situation where it would be used against me at a job. I went to so many harassment training and heard the stories. I was like I am too vocal to allow that to happen to me. Oh how naive I was to think that.

Well in November of 2019 I was hired with a Native American tribe here in northern california. The position I applied for and then hired for was a cashier at their smoke shop.One of a few enterprises the tribe owns outside of their casino.About ten years previously I worked for their casino and really enjoyed my time there and it was a good company.

I can write a short novel about all the discriminations that I have accrued at the smoke shop. I had a boss that hated me from day one for multiple reasons from me using medical marijuana on my off time to handle pain and anxiety. To me being a man and gay on top of it. This store manager told me repeatedly that it was a man's job in the store to do heavy lifting of cases of product close to 40lbs each on large pallets, to collect and take out the trash. That it was my responsibility to climb ladders, and do any general labor while my female co workers didn't . That it would Be better for her to personally live a life of sin than to be married ever again, and heard racial slurs of people and incidents that were negative from her life. That she understood me because she has a nephew that is gay.

I was passed up for multiple promotions to get me off on call and on to part time. New hires were getting promoted over me. Then I had a tribal member co worker literally run from the other side of the room to my face less than a foot away screaming at me with her saliva hitting me all over my face. that i wasnt allowed to speak gay in the store and in front of another male that happens to also be a tribal member with connections . That is when a disgusting feeling of intolerance, ignorance , and bigotry hit me. I was humiliated,mad,upset and at that time I felt ashamed of being myself.

I left the work site as soon as I could. When my store manager found out she did nothing about it. Even though there was a witness to her acting like that. Shortly after that incident, that employee was promoted to shift manager over me.

She retaliated against me for going to management. Every shift it was worse and worse. I was taking anxiety medications just to make it through the shifts. I went to tribal members, members of management, and coworkers. Nobody would help me; they told me that she was tribal and nothing could be done.

You might say to yourself why didnt you just leave? It was at the beginning of the pandemic. Everyone I knew was losing their jobs and I thought my only option was to continue working until I had a better understanding of this deadly virus. I was in a way stuck!

I had to bite my tongue, turn the other cheek, be a way better person than the people that were treating me this way. I would go home and cry to friends and family. I started becoming severely depressed and anxiety that was out of control at times.

I felt sick going to work throwing up at times and my general health started to decline from the stress. They made me sign a training memo so that I wouldn't express my personal thoughts. The comment i had made that got that employee to tell me that i wasnt allowed to speak gay at the store. I like to go to Home Depot to check out guys there it is quoted nothing else.

After three months of hell they finally got rid of her. But not for the bad treatment of me or discrimination. The lady started to pick on that male employee that was there the night of the incident. His mother, a tribal council member, caught wind and had her fired.

I would like to say that was the end no no. It keeps going that was only for six months into my employment, I was employed for 21 months.

The manager then continued to harass me after that in round robin type incidents whether big or small followed by a verbal warning that she said be a write up next time. When i was close to my 12 months i kept asking for a promotion to full time. She would say let me check on that and I'll get back to you. That went on for months.I had to tell them I was looking into a lawyer for filing a possible lawsuit because I felt like I was being discriminated against. That finally got me promoted. Since in a way i forced her hand for the promotion. She turned up the heat on me. A few weeks before my termination the head administrator for the tribe was watching me on cameras and saw that I was wearing a headband. The work environment was hot and had an A/C not equipped to meet the high demands and that I have a medical disability from a head surgery as a child. I sweat profusely from my head in any activity. Showering, eating, walking, thinking about the sweat and adding that working in a hot store with open windows, car exhaust, and summer temperatures of up to 100 plus.

The administrator wanted me to remove it. I said I couldnt and that I could get a doctor's note for it. The very next day it led to this incident where the store manager tore into me in front of other staff, degrading me and approaching me in a threatening manner attempting to corner me. I then went to Human Resources because she told me I was fired, because I was attempting to leave the store to end the fight.

I went to HR and I told them everything from day one to the 20th month of employment. They put me on administrative leave pending an investigation. I had to provide a medical note from a doctor authorized for me to have some sort of bandanna or sweat band to not only make me more comfortable, but to prevent my anxiety from going haywire because of the possible social response from customers and coworkers. When I would have to hand back products and cash that would be wet.It would be like going to a gym using the equipment and not wiping the sweat you dripped on it. My sweat drips from my head like I stood under a light flowing shower. I have no control over it and have attempted multiple medical solutions to attempt to rectify it. It hasn't worked. since the very first day of employment. I wore some type of headband or head covering.

I got a note from a doctor and they stopped pushing for a possible ADA violation.saying I had to wear a hat over the head band, Yes ! it did make it alot worse. But i complied to there new rules. They even gave me a 60 cent an hour raise because I was such a good worker. Felt like a bribe to keep me quiet.

On the 25th of August I reported to work to see that my new shift manager for the night was again the shift manager that discriminated against me. I went to HR. I couldnt work again with her and relive the nightmares all over again. I was upset and crying. They wanted me to sign a written warning discipline for call outs, that I had to make because of work stress.

I was begging them at one point to let me go, fire me, do anything other than force me to work through that . They brought that great tribal administrator back, this time he wasn't there to help me he was on the attack, and at one point i had to yell at him to get out of my personal space because he was within inches of face with his hands.

He told me I was animated on camera while acting feminine with his body and hands, that he and the two other people that were in the room and also part of the initial HR briefing told me they and him don't recall anything about the first meeting, he spoke for them. He kept telling me to shut my mouth. He was going to serve discipline write ups on me unless I shut up. He got so mad twice he left the meeting.

I remained as professional and calm as I could to keep myself composed through this treatment and disrespect . After the first time; he left me, the GM and HR representative in the room. We worked on a solution to move me to another shift. He came back yelling at me saying how it was going down that I wouldn't take another position at another enterprise.A position that was never offered to me or a shift change that i agreed to do, but he was not present to see it come into fruition since he had left the room.

I told him that I see where the aggressive and threatening stance by the store manager. For getting so close and having an intimidating presence she learned from The tribal administrator.he said you know what you're fired. I replied with a thank you!

I don't know if I have a legal case or if there is anything I can do. Please help me with any information , possible recommendations for lawyers or groups and agencies I might be able to contact. There is so much more but i can't explain it all in this letter.Thank you so much in advance for any help you may provide.

Sincerely,

It's not a choice,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning everyone this is Dad Chicken in hoping you had a great weekend. I want to remind you as always that you are loved that you are valid and that you are so very special.

Do you get a sped up and is tired of hearing this is a lifestyle or this is a choice when you come out in the lgbtq community. So many people especially those of faith I think that this is a choice or that this is a lifestyle. And I have always responded and will continue to respond with why would anybody choose to be bullied to be ridiculed Tubi kicked out of their homes by their families basically be put through hell just because of a choice or a lifestyle. We do not choose to be gay or bi or lesbian or transgender Etc.  We were born this way just like you're born black or white or have red hair or blue eyes it's not a choice it's genetics we don't know why it's just how we are. What is a choice between you choose to bully us and ridicule us and make us feel like we're less than human because we're not like you it's a choice to do those things! All we want is to be able to love who we love and to live our life just like you live yours without any interruptions. I know we will never eliminate all hatred I wish we could. I do know however we can change people's hearts and at least get the number of people who hate down. So for those of you in the community to feel less than valid or are worried that you're going to be told this is a choice this is a lifestyle it's just a bad you're just jumping on the bandwagon follow your heart love who you love this is not a choice there's a reason those desires are in you. My DM's are open if anyone needs to talk I am available.

Affirmations for LGBTQ+  community,HealingOrca,ainbow, 
What am I being?,WhaleSizeDick,ainbow,"This is happening recently. Me, who borned with penis, felt me as male and still my soul is male, I always wanted girl, I dated few girls, kissed them and liked it, they never let me be their bf at the end, and now I feel weird for what I am feeling.

Because of a lot of failure in relationship, I lost self esteem and blamed my look. I got bullying in high school for being foreigner who speaks local language (not English) badly. And my conclusion was ""I look so naive and easy for them to play"", and I thought this was the reason why they didn't look me as bf object (Even no girl said this on rejection). I hated my face, height (5'10"" tho, nobody called me shorty) and my all attention aimed the one idea, ""All these traits are originated for me being asian."". I hate myself for not being mature early enough both physically and mentally.

I started to be obsessed searching what genetical influence can cause. The more I searched, the bully experience and low esteem from relationship mixed together and I developed ""inferiority fetish""; which is just me enjoying the forced happy hormone that generated to prevent depression shock from thinking ""How not enough am I as a man to deserve love for lacking genetical feature that I couldn't choose.""

And here comes my gender identity issue. As long as I thought, common male hates other male's smell like sweat because of rivality thing, and that was the reason where gay hate idea came from. They feel disgusted. But I never thought like that. I see penis just as object.

But in my inferiority fetish, I am currently enjoying big penis. When I see them in my horny time, I start thinking that ""Woah that looks so big, thick gorgeous compared to mine! (5.5 inch) **I might want to hold them. Or even suck them.**"" Again, I grew as full hetero boy, never attracted by man (I just rate them as object).

I am conscious about all these inferiority that I feel are cap. I'm not that short, my dick is just normal, my face is ok and it even attracted girl who are not a fan of asian. And I know that all soul deserve respect no matter how is your meat that your soul belong look like. But at same time, I overthink of how ppl are judgmental by lookism, asians have low chance in date market, ppl think there's only tall man and not tall man, big penis and not big penis. And middle of this chaotic thinks, I just wanna play with other's big penis, still knowing that how hetero boy was and am I.

What am I? Bi? or just broken hetero? I am kinda sad for feeling this existential crisis in 22 when all teen figure out in 10\~15, so I feel late-mature. Also sad for being virgin 22yr who wants his first experience with hetero girl at least before really realizing that he is Bi. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - I grew as hetero. but because of inferiority fetish, I want dick. And I feel awkward to know what am I."

"my cousin sister told me she's lesbian in secret, how can I help her feel safe?",mekoomi,ainbow,"My cousin sister is 12, and yesterday in private she told me she really likes girls but she doesn't know how to confront all these new feelings. She said she hasn't told anyone, and is afraid her mom might react negatively. I told her she's awesome and I'm happy she told me, and I really want to support her.

 I don't really understand my own sexuality and didn't really put a label on it, but I understand that this is really important for her and I want to make her feel comfortable, what can I do to help? She's very shy and I don't want to mess up anything.

Yesterday she asked me if she should tell her mom even though she's afraid her mom might shut her out. I told her her mom seems very chill, however we live in a country where people are still pretty traditional, here even a couple holding hands gets weird stares by older people on the road. I told her that her sexuality is hers alone, and its not compulsory to tell people immediately. I said she could probably bring up topics about LGBT around her mom and see how she reacts first. She seemed relieved and the conversation kinda ended.

But I was so nervous and me, being the shithead I am during sudden situations, I was blabbering words and I don't think I made sense at all haha, I think she got what I meant though. Today she left to her home and I said if she wants to open up later on, I'm always there for her.

Is there anything I can say to help? Or am I pushing too much, I really don't want her to feel uncomfortable. I never really labeled my sexuality much as I feel it keeps changing so I don't know how to talk about sexuality to her, can you help me out?"

I've started meeting guys since I joined college (18yo) but none of them ever worked out, and then the pandemic came, but I started talking to a guy I've meet a few years ago and we kinda feel a connection and I'm sure sex is something that is going to come up (I'm a virgin myself) and I want to do it, I feel ready and I've done research about protection, but in my head, all I can think of is ""what if we are both tops?"" I know sex is more than just penetration but what if it is a deal breaker to him (if it is, probably not someone cool to be a boyfriend).
A part of me is like ""just ask him"", I love communication, but at the same time isn't that a bit of a personal topic?

Hypocrisy,Tenerui,ainbow,"Todays incident all started when I asked to get a pixie cut. Im real tired of my hair at the length it is now and would prefer something out of the way. My sister was there and I went through a few photos to show her what I was thinking about getting. Then theres this one photo thats real short and butch. 

Ive had my suspicions that she was homophobic for a while, but I wasnt too sure. She said, nah that one looks kind of gay.

Homophobe confirmed. 

Anyway, my other sister was FaceTiming her and asked if it looked gay. Now this other sister of mine is blatantly homophobic, so she goes yeah, you got something you wanna tell us? 

I laughed, as if it were something far out there. 

My sister who was here then proceeded to tell me that all I needed to do was scrunch it. I asked her to do it now so I would know how to do it. And now I look like Hermione Granger. She gave up because it wasnt working out right. 

So she gave in to the idea of me cutting my hair real short, but I had to compromise and just get a short Bob with layers. 

Right before she left we all got to talking about racism, somehow. Then my sister on FaceTime goes, We all bleed red, Mom, anyone can be racist. 

Ah, yes. Except for me. Because I, and all the other members of the alphabet mafia, must bleed blue. I guess thats the very logical reason for her exception to her equality rule. 

I mean, Im not all that sad about it. I cried once because I had realized that a loving relationship with my family was not possible. But now things are different. 

I just see it as funny, how someone can be so hypocritical. 

So I guess for now until I have control over my life and body, Ill continue to laugh as though Im not blatantly bi. Ill never say it, but I also wont stop acting bi. 

When I fall in love again, I dont have to tell them anything. Ill be bi at school and if they somehow find out, because they seem to have eyes and ears everywhere, then oh well. 

Maybe my Mom will disown me. Do I look  like I care? Its not like we have a healthy relationship now. What makes you think Ill be sad about you not loving me? Its gonna happen eventually, when Im old enough to live on my own. What makes you think Im scared? 

What? Youll hit me? Its not its the first time someone who was supposed to love me has done something like that. And that time I cared. 

And I got something good out of this too. Were doing this writing assignment in English class about a real life event. I couldnt for the life of me think of anything good. But now Ive got something. 

Im gonna expose everyone out of spite. Even though only the teacher will read it. At least someone will know how horrible they all are.

The thing is they knew I was a member because both told me it was comforting having someone in the community serve them.  Yall it was heartwarming.  I don't wear any pins or jewelry or anything indicating I'm bi or anything like that.  I simply treat all people equally.  If I'm asked yes I admit im bi im not ashamed of it.  It's just in my profession we try not to be overly accessorized to be more professional in appearance. If we treat people equally and with respect we would find we have more in common than we know.

Mixed feelings about coming out,RosieLou,ainbow,"Im 25F and have known Im either bi or lesbian for a few years now (with a definite preference for girls). Ive never felt the need to come out exactly - I sort of figured that if I ended up with a long-term same-sex partner Id bring them home and then it would be obvious that I wasnt straight. However, Im getting to the stage in life where people my age are starting to settle down with long-term partners, getting married, having children etc. and Im starting to rethink my choice not to come out. Various friends and family members have tried to set me up with men and make comments about me getting married to a nice man, but thats probably not going to happen and it makes me uncomfortable. Most of my family would be very supportive if I came out, but my grandparents might be less understanding. My cousin recently came out as gay (with a long-term partner) and my Granny has struggled to accept it, so Im guessing she wouldnt be too impressed about having a second gay granddaughter!

I'm a 20 year old (ftm transman) who identifies as gay.
Recently I had a guy over, his age is 25. We had other intentions but due to it being my first time I was nervous and We talked instead. We both felt a pretty immediate connection and I didn't feel scared of his intentions and we genuinely had nice conversation. I understand in gay relationships a slight age gap tends to exist just due to limited dating pool. I think I do like him but we have agreed to take things slow and start off as friends. We both did not expect to like each other in that way. I've talked to some friends about it and they haven't been as approving which is understandable. I live in Wisconsin and other out gay men are not as common where I live. My age limit was originally 19-23 but upon meeting him we were more intrigued with getting to know each other other than original plans to have some fun. We cuddled and genuinely felt at peace with each other. I'm kinda worried if maybe I'm making an impulsive discion or it's just insecurity. Most guys I have tried to date within my age range don't seem as open to communication or understanding boundaries. The guy I met up with didn't expect to have feelings like he has considering he thought his age limit minimum was 23. He said I'm more mature for my age (which I've been told numerous times by others) and we really got along. We met up thrbnext day and got some food together and learned about each other more.. I'm just curious of this is really the right move or if I'm vulnerable to misuse/abuse. I was Also socially raised female so I'm not sure if that's part of it. Overall we respect each other's boundaries and we enjoy each other's company. Ik what I want just matter of going to school and being a more independent adult (thanks covid) just want to make sure I'm making the right decision.

Gender survey question language,marmosetohmarmoset,ainbow,"Hello. I'm in a new job, where I've been asked to review the language for a demographics survey we're doing. As the only queer in the office, I want to make sure I get it right. The original wording was this:

&gt;Gender identity:

&gt;* Female

&gt; * Male

&gt; * Non-binary or gender non-conforming person

&gt; * An option not listed here, please specify: [Text box]

&gt; * Prefer not to answer

Since male, female, and ""gender non-conforming person"" are not really genders (for example I am GNC, but my gender is woman), I've changed the options to:

&gt;Gender identity:

&gt;* Woman

&gt; * Man

&gt; * Non-binary, genderqueer, or gender fluid

&gt; * An option not listed here, please specify: [Text box]

&gt; * Prefer not to answer

I think it's improved, but I'm not quite sure about listing non-binary, genderqueer, or gender fluid together. I think what my bosses are really interested in is just the proportion of man, woman, and ""something else,"" so I grouped a few together so that there'd be more identities listed. However, I don't want to imply that non-binary, genderqueer, and gender fluid are somehow all one gender.

"i find myself a little transphobic and i don't want to be, how should i become more accepting?",lonely-lvcifer,ainbow,"i'm taking a risk of getting banned, but i really wanted to leave my thoughts somewhere.


i am AFAB demifem lesbian and i sometimes find myself being transphobic, especially towards MtF people, which is clearly not good. and i am very aware, because transgender people did nothing wrong and i don't want to view them the way i do. after all, the T in LGBT is an important part of the community, and they have to be treated with respect since the demifem part of me also falls under the transgender umbrella term.

i only struggle with accepting that trans women are women and trans men are men.

and it's not like i spread hateful comments about transgender people online or complain about them getting more rights in my country, no. it's all in my mind and i want to change that...i don't even understand why am i like this. am i afraid of the fake transbian predators, straight men pretending to be women? and i know that it's a low possibility of this happening, just some hateful part of me constantly has similar thoughts...

but again, i don't want to view trans people this way.

any tips from y'all so i can become more accepting? thank you."

Wisdom Teeth,closetedwisdomteeth,ainbow,"Hello all.

I am getting my wisdom teeth out soon and I am extremely nervous. The procedure itself I'm not worried about, it's being high that's killing me. I am in the closet and in a position where I cannot come out due to safety reasons. I am a minor and my parents are staunchly anti-LGBTQIA+ so I am very concerned that I may let something slip while I'm high after the procedure. Is there any possibility of this? What should I do if this happens?

Thank you so much!"

[Coming Out] NB AMAB 17yro with doubts about my identity and family problems How do I come out?,Mysterious-Group478,ainbow,"Apologies in advance for the long post ...

For as long as I can remember I have tried to come to terms with my own gender identity. I'm not sure why, specifically, but it's something that has crossed my mind many times over the years (it has become more prevalent over the years).

I introduce myself as a male every day with my family and at school and I have never had a problem with he / he pronouns, (although I prefer the pronoun ""elle""), but some days I wish I had a choice, you know? I've often fantasized about having a magic pill or switch that I could push every morning to choose whether my body was male or female that day. I don't think I'd ever want to fully transition to female, because many times I like to be man! I like having facial hair, wearing suits, and everything else. But not all the time. Sometimes I think I want to be able to wear a dress and look in the mirror and see a girl looking at me.

I honestly don't know what I'm supposed to do with this !!

The closest words to describe my situation seem to be 'non-binary', 'genderfluid', and / or 'bigender'. Not sure exactly which one best suits my situation, if any?

And here comes one of my problems, I don't know how to talk about it with my family, my father is a very mysoginist man and I don't think he would accept / understand my situation and although I have more confidence in my mother, I don't know how to talk about this with her

How do I come out with my family, how to explain to them how I feel, how I would be happy ...

Can anyone help me feel a little less lonely? Where do I go from here?"

Love?,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hi all dad here just stopping by offering free to those who need it.  Also to remind you of the three words everyone especially kids need to hear from their parents I LOVE YOU!

What do you do when you like someone and they reject you.  For instance you finally decided to ask out your crush and they're not interested in you in that way what do you do.  When I was a teenager and even into m early 20's I used to upset and automatically think something must be wrong with me.  Maybe im not good looking or im too tall or not good enough at sports or not popular enough.  All these thoughts would run through my head to the point I was not pleasant to be around.  So I would workout more and try to dress differently and all sorts of things to avoid being turned down.  Then one day when i was around 25 it hit me they never said i wasn't good enough just that they weren't into me like that.  In other words there's going to be people who have a crush on you that you're not into and people who you are interested in who aren't interested in you.  You're not ugly or not good enough they just aren't into you.  Not everybody we like is going to like us and they're not required to. It's just life it's the way things go.  Does that mean you shouldn't put yourself out there.  No it means you definitely put yourself out there.  So somebody said no big deal the next person may say yes.  You will never know who's interested in you if you don't try.  Just the other night I asked this server at a restaurant for his phone number turns out he wasn't into men.  I thanked him and continued on my search for love.  It is rare that love happens like it does in the movies most of the time it takes work and effort.  So don't be discouraged if you get a no just remember a yes may be right around the corner.  My DM'S are open to all.

Dilemma with pronouns for college account,peneloperose666,ainbow,"Hello all!  My name is Penelope and I've just come to the conclusion that I'm gender fluid rather than just nonbinary.  I go by He/She/Zi but honestly what gender I identify as changes.  I'm starting college this month and on my account I want to add my pronouns, but they only have combinations for one gender (I suppose that's how I can explain it).  So like He/Him/His ,She/Her/Hers, They/Them/Theirs etc...  I personally don't like they/them.  I know singular they exists but it just feels weird to me still, having a pronouns that's also used for groups.  I'm just not a fan of they/them, though of course I respect anyone's decision to us it:). I like Zi much better because it's a separate pronouns, that feels singular for me, unlike how they feels to me.  But if I use only that, I feel like in classes my identity of changing on a day to day or week to week basis is overshadowed.  I hope this doesn't sound petty, I just wish they had that option, I guess I'll just leave it as not listed until I can just introduce myself.  It makes me a bit nervous, so I felt like coming on here and sharing my struggle with this.  I suppose I'm just getting use to this new world of mine, but I already love it.

Well my kids and I were talking last night and my oldest daughter the one who's pregnant asked me what's one piece of advice she should pass on to her child.  I thought about it for a minute and I told her this.  Love is love its not just an LGBTQ slogan.  Your child is still your child regardless if who they love.  If they are lgbtqia+ its ok.  If they love someone who is tall or short its ok.  Fat or thin its ok.  If their skin color is different its ok.  Whatever it is its ok.  Your child is still the same person regardless of who they love.  It's your job to make sure they know your ok with that.  As parents we instill values into them.  If you did the best you could raising them then you have to trust they make sound decision based on those values.  I told her never be critical of who your child loves unless that persons abusive.  Allow children to make mistakes so they learn on their own.  As parents we cant always be there to stop them from making a mistake but we can damn sure be there for them to help them learn from it.  Children need freedom to express themselves.  Parents your job is to provide them with information and then support whatever decision they make.  Let's say your son 12 years old wants to wear a dress to school.  Don't discourage him.  Let him know it's ok with you but other people may make fun of him.  If he decides to go ahead you support him. Protecting our kids doesn't mean nothing bad can ever happen to them it just means they've been taught to handle it if it does.  Yes love is love let your kids be themselves and kids don't be afraid to ask to express yourself not all parents will say no.  Let's face it how will you know what you like if you don't try it.  My DM'S are open to all.

Love

Hi! Closeted trans girl just looking for advice,Tristo2005,ainbow,"Hiya everyone, I'm not sure if this is a good place to post this or if I should try a more targeted subreddit, but please let me know

I'm a closeted trans girl and I'm in the middle of trying to experiment with how I present myself, as I can't talk to a gender therapist for another few months. So I'm trying to look for some ways to make myself appear more feminine.

I'm really asking for any advice, I havent tried makeup and I don't know how to without being clocked. I share a room with my sibling who doesn't know, and I'd rather not know right now. But if you have some advice on clothes, hair, workout routines, or diets, I'd love to hear them "

Tonight there's no story or advice.  Tonight I just want you to know you are loved.  Whether you feel it or not.  Whether you believe it or not you are loved.  So many times we go through the day never hearing those three words I love you.  They mean more than most people realize.  Those three words can make your day better when it's been hell.  When you're nervous or scared they give you strength. When you're worried they can bring calm.  Those three words are more powerful than any other words in the world.  They can repair a broken heart when heard or break a heart when never said.  For us in the community it's those three words we long to hear after coming out yet sadly for many we never do.  So if you haven't heard today or ever maybe hear it now I love you.  From the bottom of my heart all if you are so loved.  I believe in each and every one of you.

Regardless, I knew I liked girls from a young age, and I'm out to quite a few of my friends as well as my mom.  I have never been interested in guys sexually or even really had crushes on them.

...

But I met this guy.  He's super nice, funny, charming.  If I were straight, he would be my type.  And for some reason, he is into me, which is making me very confused.  I kind of want to go out with him because he seems cool and to be perfectly honest, I'm curious what it's like to date a dude.

I can't really decide if I'm actually crushing on him, or if it's just the pressure of comp het and society's expectations for me to be a straight girl (along with the flattery that someone is actually into me).  Has anyone been in the same boat?

Also, if we did start to date, should I tell him this?  I don't really want to scare him away because I feel like we could still be friends, but I feel like I should be honest in case we go on a date or two and things don't work out.

Euphoria,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good evening family dad checking in sorry for no check in yesterday it was a super crazy day at work.  I hope everyone is ok and you've had a great day.

So today I want to talk about doing things that bring you euphoria.  In the lgbtqia+ community a lot of people remain in the closet well into adulthood because of a variety of reasons.  Whatever the reason its important to do things that bring you euphoria in order to maintain your cover or your sanity or both.  Find things that make it easier for you to hang on until you can come out.  For trans people it may be an outfit or one article of clothing.  It may be make up or lip gloss.  For others in the community it may be a small flag of your gender or sexuality, cuffing your pants if you're bi, a screen saver on your phone or computer only you know the meaning of.  Whatever it is find it and claim it until you can come out.  For those who are out but still need those moments of euphoria you can be bolder with your choices again whatever it is if it works do it.  

For my trans family don't discouraged when you feel like you don't pass.  The change seems so slow to you because you see yourself in the mirror every day.  When people compliment you on the change believe them.  They see more drastic results than you do.  I had a friend who lost 150 pounds but every time he looked in the mirror he saw the guy who was overweight and in bad health still.  He had seen it for so long he couldn't believe what others were telling him.  Trust me my dears if I say you pass i genuinely believe you do or i wouldn't say it.

Like a lot of people my age, I've been on grindr and tinder and hooked up with a decent amount of people, but in the past year or so, I've become more or less uninterested in the actual act of having sex. I love the build up and foreplay that comes before like sexting, making out, and flirting, but actually having sex tends to leave me feeling bored or uninterested. I don't really get any real gratification from it at all. I like the thought of having sex, but not actually doing it.

dating through apps. any advice?,sehrny,ainbow,"I'm a 19 yo gay trans boy who just moved to Canada. I have never had sex with men (only girls) and wanna find someone here through dating apps.  
The problem is that I come from a very homophobic country and I can't get used to the fact that it is safe to be gay in Canada. I've met some nice guys in Grindr, but I'm so afraid they are phobic and just want to do something bad with me. I told them that I would meet in a public space like a shopping mall or a hotel room and they all are ok with this. But I'm still afraid that they may shoot a video and share it (without my consent) or they are not who they say they are.  
Another reason why I don't feel safe is that I'm small and weak and will not be able to protect myself.

idk what to do with it. I'm really horny and literally suffering without sex, but can't get rid of my fear.

any advice? maybe there are some ways to protect myself so that I will feel safer?"

Why gender conception is long overdue,sorcerykid,ainbow," Currently there is no way to describe gender nonconformity using the limited language of ""gender identity"" and ""gender expression"". These terms simply do not account for the lived realities of many gender nonconforming folks, particularly those that are unable to express themselves authentically due to stigma or shame. As a result, they are erased by the existing language.

Consider the simplest example of a femboy that has to repress his feminine nature due to fear of being harassed at school or punished at home, resulting in severe depression and anxiety. He is still a femboy, even if he is unable to safely convey that fact to other people.

This is where *gender conception* comes into play:

* **gender conception (n)** \- the way in which a person looks, acts, thinks, or feels with respect to gender norms and ideals including appearance, behavior, mannerisms, speech patterns, emotions, interests, ambitions, pronouns, honourifics, and subjective self-concept.

While *gender expression* and *gender identity* have proven useful for discussing the experiences of transgender and nonbinary people, *gender conception* provides much needed language for gender nonconforming people to also communicate their own unique experiences."

Wondering if the real reason my ex broke up with me is because she likes girls,Rainy_spells,ainbow,"Alright this is kind of a long story. A while ago my girlfriend broke up with me, which came as quite a shock because we had a good relationship and chemistry. She said she thinks I'm still an amazing person, but that a relationship is too much for her. She did say that she'd still really like to stay friends etc.

I'm still recovering from the breakup, and we haven't talked since. We still have each other on all socials, and I started noticing that she has started reblogging a lot of art of lesbian ships from some shows. We both have lgbt+ friends, and I'm on the ace spectrum myself (I'm a guy btw), so posting and reblogging lgbt+ things is nothing new or unexpected, but she never posted so much if any lesbian ship art before (maybe once or twice), and I can't help but overthink it...

I think why I'm thinking about this so much is also due to the fact that our breakup was weird, things were going great, but all of a sudden she ended it, without really giving a reason except for that she wants to focus on other things (study, mental health) and that a relationship is too intense. I never experienced it as intense personally, and I was always supporting her, so I really couldn't see what it would be too much. Idk but I've had a weird feeling the whole time that I'm missing something, that she wasn't telling everything... Maybe that she just didn't like me anymore, but wanted to be nice about it, I have no clue.

We've talked about sexuality and stuff before, and she always said she wasn't gay. But now that she's posting about it so much I can't help but wonder if she might not have told me thr truth. I know it might be weird to obsess about this, and it totally isn't my place to assume these things about someone, I know that, but please don't judge me too harshly. I'm still hurting and confused, and I'm just looking for answers and closure.

(I can't really ask her myself, we haven't talked anymore since the breakup. And since she broke up with me, I really don't want to initiate again contact before she does.)"

I need help understanding my sexuality.,notime500,ainbow,"hi, I'm male, 18.

I've been struggling with my sexual identity for longer than I'd like to admit. I'm not comfortable talking about this IRL so I hope someone here will be willing to listen.

(I have to censor a few words, please don't flag this post)

I'm not romantically attracted to men. I've never had a male crush, never fallen in love with a guy. I never catch feelings for my male friends, male celebrities, male strangers etc. I find typical male traits really unappealing. on the other hand, I've been romantically and sexually interested in women for as long as I can remember. I've always resonated with women differently. I'm not very comfortable with traditional masculinity and I've often wished I could be more like a girl. I don't remember when exactly these feelings started but there were traces of them throughout elementary school. for example, when I was a kid, I remember shoving things up my shirt to simulate b\*\*\*\*\*s, and I liked the way that made me feel. apart from this, though, I had countless crushes on girls and I always sought relationships with them.

warning these details might be awkward to read. with free access to the internet I was exposed to p\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*y when I was far too young, like hardcore p\*\*\*. I learned how to m\*\*\*\*\*\*\*e around the same time. I feel like this experience really messed with my perception of sex growing up. it started off with only women, then I'd watch videos with a woman and a man. after a while of this, I started to mimic some of the actions and behaviors of the women. I didn't feel any sexual attraction towards the men in the picture, but I began to play more of a submissive role like the women. nothing was different outside of this setting, I never left feeling I might be gay or interested in men.

things escalated over time and I began performing homosexual acts on myself. this has continued to happen and gotten more extreme. when it happens, it feels like a different person takes over my body, and when I'm done I have to pick up the pieces from before. when I do everything hetero, I feel great, but when I'm submissive, I leave feeling gross, drained, dissociated, miserable. it's just become an endless cycle. I've tried to validate the experience by watching gay p\*\*\* to see if it would connect with me and I find it kind of repulsive, no matter what mood I'm in. I don't mean this in an offensive way, I just mean that it doesn't work for me at all. I can only watch videos with women to do any of these things.

I'm still a v\*\*\*\*\* and I'm yet to have any real sexual encounters. but what this has done is make me feel more uncomfortable/awkward around both men and women. when I'm around women I'm attracted to, I feel like my behavior makes me unable to satisfy them, and I'll never be good enough. when I'm around guys, it feels I have an obligation to be attracted to them since I've embraced homosexual behaviors, and I'm just not attracted to them or interested in them at all. when I see gay couples on TV, I can't relate to them at all. society tends to have far stricter rules for male sexuality than female. it's either you're straight or you're gay. I don't want to be ""stuck"" with men I have no interest in and ""lose"" women if I'm on the LGBT spectrum. I'm finding it harder to get romantically or sexually excited at all anymore. this whole experience has made me lonelier and started to deter me away from sex as a whole.

in 9th grade, I tried to come to a realization about my sexuality and posted on Instagram that I was bisexual. there was little response, positive or negative, but I felt so humiliated. I felt that I'd misrepresented myself publicly and that everyone would see as someone I wasn't, since I truly have no romantic or sexual interest in men. I'd been dealing with uncontrollable anxiety at school, and the stress of this situation led to me making the biggest mistake of my young life in dropping out and switching to online classes. seeing that I have now graduated and gotten no closure regarding my sexuality, I feel kinda desperate.

given how long I've been infatuated with women / feminine roles / behavior etc, there's a possibility I may be happier somewhere else on the gender spectrum. I've tried to consider this but I don't know man. I'd rather find peace and comfort with my genetic male self than imperfectly change my identity and have to deal with that forever. I respect everyone who goes through that sort of thing but I couldn't do it. as if all this wasn't complicated enough, my best friend since 3rd grade, who has expressed themselves more effeminately in recent years, has opened up heavily about their sexuality this year and is now identifying as something like nonbinary. this is a big change and has come as a surprise to some. them and I have always pursued similar things, so if I came forward and shared my feelings about my gender identity right after they did, I'd probably be accused of faking it to be more like them. which would be kinda devastating.

if anyone could help bring me some peace or advice regarding my whole situation, I'd be very grateful. I'm tired of dealing with this alone and I want be comfortable pursuing relationships and embracing sexuality without struggling so hard with my identity. thank you for reading &lt;3"
How do folks deal with body issues?,chirecoverylgbt,ainbow,"I've always had body issues and never felt satisfied with how I look. Being a scrawny kid I never felt large enough or fit enough. I always had people say to me ""oh gee you're so skinny you should eat more"". Fast forward to being an adult, I figured the only way to be happy would be to be bigger. I tried on and off to do fitness programs but ironically always quit before I got very far in. I got deterred by how difficult it is to eat right or doing consistent exercise, and my negative thinking would say ""you'll never look like what you want regardless of what you do or you're too old to start"" and so I gave up.

I'd imagine body issues are a common issue in the LGBTQ community? I look at these apps that prioritize swiping on photos and having a toned perfect body. It makes me feel terrible but I'm trying to work through this with my therapist. I would love to connect with folks that have progressed further than I or are currently working through issues."

Let's be the voice of change,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hi family dad back again just to make sure your day was ok.  You know i love you and want to make sure you're good physically and mentally.

You know it pisses me off that we are sitting around waiting on politicians to fight our battle.  Most if not all of the politicians are hetero and have no clue what we're going through. We have trans kids and teens who are starting back to school and have PE or other sports and have nowhere that they can comfortably change they're being forced to change in the bathroom of their birth gender instead of their true gender. We have other members of the community who are being discriminated against just because they're lgbtq. They're being looked over for jobs they're being passed over for promotions it's unreal what we face on a daily basis and yet we sit back and wait thinking the politicians are going to solve the problems for us. Well I don't know about you but I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of being discriminated against I'm tired of being bullied I'm tired of people thinking we're less than human just because we're lgbtq. I'm ready to stand up for myself and get what is mine. We need to realize that the politicians and other people that are quote-unquote lobbying for us are only interested in re-election and lining their pockets. If we want equality we need to reach out and grab it. It's about time we put some lgbtq officials in Washington. It's about time we put people in there who know our issues and will legitimately fight for our issues. That being said we can't rely on that to happen anytime soon we must be willing to fight for what we believe in. It is time as a community that we rise up and handle business ourselves. If you've been discriminated against at work take that person to court if you've been looked over for promotion take him to court. kids if you're being bullied in school turn the bully in if we keep making enough noise at some point in time they're going to have to listen to us. If you don't believe me you should have asked Martin Luther King jr. Years ago why they started marching it's because nobody was listening to them they had a problem that needed to be solved and they took to the streets to solve it.  They marched they protested they made noise until people realized hey what we are doing is wrong. It is not until a group gets so loud that politicians have no choice but to listen to them that they ever begin to make laws that work for them. Lgbtq Community it's time we made some noise rise up let your voices be heard shout from the mountain tops that we want equality! It only takes a few people to start a movement and get the ball rolling kind of like an avalanche it just takes one rock falling down a mountain to start an avalanche and it builds speed and momentum as it go. We have to get the momentum going now.  Personally I've never done anything like that before wouldn't know where to start but I'm willing to try I just need to know who's with me? My DM's are open to anyone that wants to talk or share ideas.

I'm sleeping with another man for the first time tonight. He really likes being submissive, and I think trying to dom him would be good for my confidence, but I have no idea what I am doing here. Before basically this week I would have told you I was straight/vanilla

Is there any sort of prep work I need to do, different/beyond what I would do if this were a het hookup? Are there any tricks to keeping in a dommy mindset? Are there any things I should try that I might not be thinking of?

My current plan for the first encounter is basically to give him a both-parties-naked massage and hope that naturally transitions into something more

Any advice at all would be appreciated. I feel scared and clueless"

Anxiety and stress after hookup (am I over worrying)?,Alwaysgonnask,ainbow,"Hello everyone, I'm writing this to see if I'm honestly just beating myself up for nothing. Roughly 21 days ago I met up with a guy on Grindr, we did the deed (I was the top and he was the bottom) and I wore a condom. As I was pulling out the condom came off (think half out of him and hanging in the wind). He said he was negative and that I shouldn't worry. I didn't get on pep nor am I currently on prep.

Terrified that I caught something I did an Std test (gonorrhea, chlaymidia and syphilis) 6 days later, all of which are negative. I then took two HIV RNA test, one at 8.5 days and the other 10.5 days post exposure and both were negative. I still have this voice in my brain telling me I contracted something and I'm just trying to figure out if it's a justified voice or not. I do have another test (4th gen antibody for HIV) at 24 days post exposure in 2 days. Currently I have no symptoms beyond some stomach pains (which might be stress) and lack of appetite. Am I just worrying myself too much?"
Come on out,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family dad here doing a lunch check in seeing how your day is going.  Just be safe and remember I love you.

So a lot of people keeping asking how and when to come out to their parents.  First there is no set age to come out only you can decide when you're ready.  If you're afraid your parents won't love you anymore or won't accept you I can't lie to you it is a possibility you have to consider along with being kicked out.  Most parents however just simply don't know a lot about lgbtqia+ and will need you to explain.  Only you know how extreme your parents will react.  If they tend to overreact a lot chances are they will about you coming out.  If they are pretty calm and level headed then you're probably ok to go ahead.  There are many factors to consider when coming out but 2 of the most important is your safety and your mental health.  Unfortunately only you know the risk on both of those.  If you believe you're not safe and not coming out will not effect your mental health stay in the closet for now, but if it will severely damage your mental health and you believe you can make if kicked out then come out.  I have said this before if your ready to come out have a plan.  1. save up your money. 2.  Have a pre packed bag ready to go.  3. Have somewhere lined up to stay trust me you don't want to live on the streets.  4. Have friends and allies who can help you. 5.  Be prepared to have to cut ties completely with your family.  If you have all of that and your mentally prepared to come out then go for it.  Your mental wellbeing is more important than your relationships.  I don't say any of this to deter you from coming out only to give you the information to make an informed decision.  Majority of parents will love you regardless of who you love.  If your only concern is if they will still love you chances are they will. My DM'S are open if you need to talk

Love 
Dad"
What category do I fit into?,Insomniacxp,ainbow,"Hai guys!  Im new to this group but Im just gonna come out and be honest.

BUT my personality can be very feminine at times, I know Im a girl so I do embrace that. Lol. I am more so attracted to females, very femme females. But if I come across a very femme male who is interested in dominant mascs then Im open minded to that as well. I dont usually pay attention to gender. If I like you, I like you.

Can you debunk these anti-anal claims?,Affectionate_Joke602,ainbow,"There is too much stigma attached to anal sex. Among some gay men, it is called ""the most dangerous hobby"". There is a [http://man2manalliance.org/](https://male2male.com) website promoting the idea that anal sex is not pleasurable and not worth it because it is the riskiest sexual activity and requires unnecessarily long preparation. I don't know if there are any sources debunking these claims. If you know, please share them with me. From man2manalliance:

&gt;The erotic pleasure in anal penetration is so minimal, and, when joined with promiscuity, the dangers anal presents to its practitioners and the community so great, that it's difficult to conceive of a practice more ruinous or less enjoyable taking center place in a sexual subculture.  
&gt;  
&gt;These dangers, of which HIV/AIDS is the best known, but which include hepatitis B and C, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, the human papilloma virus, herpes, and a host of other pathogens, will persist even after AIDS has been cured or can be prevented through vaccination.  
&gt;  
&gt;And more anally-transmitted diseases most certainly await discovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;For anal penetration is an exceptionally efficient mode of disease transmission, and we can be sure that pathogens will continue to find an infective niche in anal.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, no magic or wishful thinking can transform either the anus or the rectum into genital organs, nor can the feelings experienced by someone being penetrated anally be compared to those of genital stimulation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, anal penetration subjugates one of the participants to the other, effectively emasculating him, turning him into a pseudo-woman, a proxy in a heterosexualized form of contact. This is an inherently unequal act, epitomized by its tedious terminology of ""tops"" and ""bottoms,"" which is unmindful of the basic human need for a shared experience without pain and with dignity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whereas Frot, phallus-against-phallus contact, is the acme of sexual activity between Men because it's focused on that which makes Men Masculine, namely their genitals -- their Manhood -- rather than their organs of fecal excretion.

I sense misogyny when they claim a man who ""bottoms"" in anal sex becomes less of a man, a ""pseudo-woman"", and that anal penetration is inherently unequal making the ""bottom"" less than, and degrading, humiliating and demeaning the ""bottom"". 

And there's a subreddit dedicated to these people who are against anal sex: [https://old.reddit.com/r/g0ys/comments/edkcko/side\_is\_the\_new\_g0y/fdga0ad/](https://old.reddit.com/r/g0ys/comments/edkcko/side_is_the_new_g0y/fdga0ad/)

&gt;You're right that nothing is truly harmless. Even frot and mutual masturbation has theoretical risks. However, I call them harmless because that risk is low enough to be negligible.  
&gt;  
&gt;As such, there's no anal activity that comes close to frot, mutual masturbation, and other like acts in being low-risk. Yes, there are certain anal acts that pose relatively less risk compared with other anal acts. Having said that, in the big picture, any kind of anal play is high-risk. They might vary slightly in intensity of their risk, but they are all objectively high risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; ""Fecal matter is almost omnipresent in human spaces.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Thats true. However, the concentration of that matter is different. The concentration and number of fecal bacteria on a table or door handle will always be lower than the bacterias source (the anus).  
&gt;  
&gt;Doing anal play safely takes lots of preparation and precaution. It takes far more effort than vaginal sex, and certainly much more than frot.  
&gt;  
&gt;If it takes so much energy to make safe, when does the precaution needed become absurd? When exactly does the preparation needed become too ridiculous to be practical?  
&gt;  
&gt;Most importantly, if that preparation is too extensive to make sense, is the act worth doing to begin with?

&gt;And what I specifically mean by dysfunctional: it causes physical injury every time, carries an extremely high risk for STDs unmatched by other acts, and yet is constantly promoted as valid. Is sex supposed to be so risky? When does the risk become absurd?  
&gt;  
&gt;Even ""gay"" doctors (as mentioned in the M2M Alliance article) say that there's no physiological basis for anal orgasm.  
&gt;  
&gt;From the M2M Alliance link, as it quotes a ""gay"" doctor: ""Most of the nerve endings that sense pleasure are at the outside of your anus or within the first two inches. The rest of your rectum and colon do not have nerves that sense pleasure. While many will disagree with me, there is no physiological basis for most of the pleasure you derive higher up in your colon. There is definitely a psychological pleasure.""

&gt;Don't hierarchies of risks exist? In that case, how high does anal rank in that hierarchy? Which level should be marked as unacceptable risk?

"Hey im enzo im a gay ,looking for a gay partner , come private for more",enz27oo,ainbow, 
"I (Straight M23) met a cute girl character in a video game and we really hit it off. I later found out they were a guy (""Straight"" M26). We've since continued to have cybersex in character and I can't stop thinking about them. Am I gay?",IFuckedAPolarBear,ainbow,"Hello everyone, 

I know the title seems strange, but _bear_ with me please. I think I'm having a sexual identity crisis, and I don't know where else to turn! This is a throwaway btw, obviously. The name is a reference to the Striking Vipers episode of Black Mirror, if you're familiar with that. :P 

So anyway, I'm a 100% straight male (or so I thought) and I've recently begun playing this MMO game called Final Fantasy 14. It started to gain a lot of buzz a month or two ago when a bunch of popular streamers started playing it and a few of my friends and I decided to give it a shot. It is our first MMO, so I suppose I was a bit nave. You're able to customize the appearance and sex of your character in this game, and I assumed most girl characters were, in fact, girls. 

My character started in a different city from my friends, so I was unable to play with them in the beginning. I don't mind socializing in games, so I met a bunch of cool and experienced players that have been and still are very kind and helpful to me (this game has an awesome community, seriously!). Among the many people I met was a girl character, whom we can call X. 

From the beginning, I noticed that X had a particularly cute character and always had the most stylish outfits, but she was not as experienced with the game as the other people I had met, so I never really messaged her. At this point I was totally unfamiliar with the social and roleplay aspects of this game, and would only talk to people for assistance or advice. 

Well as I progressed in the game (I've since beaten the base game and first expansion), I would often come across X in random locations, and it became a running joke between us that she was following me. Every time we met, she was so kind and funny, and always stopped what she was doing to make conversation with me. She would ask me about my progress, how my day was going, if I was enjoying the game, what I did irl, and more. She would share my excitement with me as I talked with her, and would always make a reference to something I had said the previous time we had spoken, which made me feel like she was listening and really cared about what I said. We shared a lot of interests and got along swimmingly. Every time we spoke, it was a blast and I was always happy to stumble upon her!

Over time, we got to know each other better and would sometimes chat for hours. I looked forward to speaking with X and thinking about her began to excite me. I'm not gonna lie guys, since Covid I've hardly interacted with anybody IRL, let alone some one of the opposite sex. My mental health has not been great, and the past year and a half has really taken its toll on me. Needless to say, I've been lonely and horny af lol. 

Despite that, I never made any sexual or romantic comments because I know that's gross and it's not easy for girls who play video games to avoid those kinds of unwanted advances. Her friendship was enough for me at this time, but I definitely had a huge crush on her. Also, she had been so kind to me so I didn't want to tarnish that by being a creep. 

At this point, I knew all about X: what she did for work, her age, her hobbies and interests irl, the amount of siblings she had, even the city she lived in. She also knew all about me, but I made one mistake. Throughout all of this time getting to know her, I never once asked what her sex or gender was. Her character was a girl, she used ""girly"" emotes like "":3 or &lt;3"" when chatting with me (I know there are no such thing as girly emotes but that's what my lizard brain associated them with, my apologies if that is a problematic statement), she had a bunch of cute outfits and always showed them off to me and asked if I liked them, and most importantly, I really _wanted_ her to be a girl.

Then one night, we were talking as we usually did, and the topic of her sex came up. She asked what I had done that day, and I told her about my day. That day my younger sister (17f) took me along with her to get her nails done (she doesn't have a drivers license yet, so I drove her there), and since I've been suffering from poor mental health lately, my sister insisted I pamper myself and get a manicure and pedicure. She promised I would feel better and that it was on her (I didn't let my baby sister pay, she only works part time minimum wage, but the I appreciated the gesture and thought it was very sweet of her). I declined the pedicure, but did end up getting a manicure. I told X it was my first time, and that I quite liked it. I then asked her if she got her nails done often (my sister and mother love to), and she replied that she had never gotten her nails done before. I replied ""So you're more of a natural girl?"" and she told me ""No, I'm actually a guy!""

I was blindsided and my stomach began to do flips, and even though she never lied to me, I felt quite betrayed. I told her I thought she was a girl, and her character did a laugh emote, and she said ""No, silly!"" She then told me she doesn't blame me, and that she could see why I thought she was a girl. I told her I had to leave (I guess this is where I should switch to he/him, but it's so hard to come to terms with!), and I avoided her for the next two weeks. 

Fast forward to last Thursday. She messaged me saying that she was really hurt and missed talking with me, but she understood and was really sorry for not being clear that she was a guy. I felt bad, and messaged her back, and told her we should talk. As soon as we met up, I admitted that I had a big crush on her, but I was straight and that's why it was so difficult for me to accept that she was a guy. She said she was also straight, but wanted to stay friends if I was open to it. I had really missed her and it made me happy to talk with her again, so I agreed. She told me she wanted to show me The Golden Saucer, which is basically a casino with a bunch of fun games. I had never been there, and so we went and she showed me all the games. We had a lot of fun playing and mostly talking, and she kept telling me how much she had missed me and how bad she felt. Eventually we were alone in a corner, and she began doing flirty emotes at me with her character, and told me that she had a big crush on me too. This really excited me, so I didn't break the immersion and we started talking about what we liked about each other, and she took it in a sexual direction and started mentioning what she wanted me to do to her (referring to herself as a girl), and what she wanted to do to me.

She invited me to her home, in the game, and took off her characters clothes. She then started talking _very_ sexually to me (I'll spare the details), and we basically had cybersex or what she called ""ERP"" (Erotic Roleplay). I've sexted with girls before, that I've been with IRL or something, so it wasn't a feeling too different to that. The strange thing was that everything she wrote was from the perspective of her being a girl, but I didn't want to ruin the immersion so I went a long with it. She told me she wanted me to stroke myself until I finished IRL, and I did as I was told. And then the post nut clarity hit me like a fucking freight train.

I told her that I wasn't comfortable with what we did, and reiterated to her that I was straight. She replied that she was also straight, but what had happened was between our characters, a girl and a boy, and that it was not between us two guys irl. She said that if I was able to reframe it in that way, she wanted to do more with me. I still had feelings for her, and to be honest the ERP was great and very sexy, so I decided to continue. Since then we've continued and she has been very ""lovey dovey"" with me by day and very sexual by night. We've had cybersex every single night since then, sometimes multiple times a day, and I find myself thinking about her every time I get turned on.

In the moments where I am actually masturbating, my boundaries are pushed further and further in my fantasies. First, I wondered how it would feel for her to give me a blowjob IRL. And dismissed that as not being gay, and began to find that idea really hot. I mentioned it to her, and she said she'd love to do that. Then I started to think, what would I do to her? Could I give her a hand job for example? At first I thought it was gay, but it really turned me on and I realized it was not the penis part that turned me on, but the concept of getting her off and making her feel good. I'm not attracted to penises even 1%. So I told her about that too, and she also thought that was very hot, and not gay. 

Every day I engage in sexual roleplay with this person, and every day my boundaries are pushed further and further. We keep going out of character now, and talk about what we would do to eachother IRL, as guys. I'm not gay, but I'm aware that this is not straight behaviour, so I don't know. I don't think this relationship is healthy for me, and I'm questioning my sanity and entire sexual identity. Do I need help? Should I stop? Am I actually a late bloomer gay? I try to look at guys I see and try to force myself to be attracted to them, just to check if I am gay, but I don't feel any attraction, yet I'm turned on by the idea of this particular guy sucking me off and me giving him a handjob... Help!

**TL;DR: I'm a straight male with very poor mental health and have had no romantic contact with the opposite sex since covid started. I recently met a girl in a MMO game, hit it off with her and developed a crush. We began to talk every day for weeks, until I found out she was a guy. Disappointed, I stopped talking to her for a while, until she contacted me and we shared our feelings about each other. She felt the same way, and as one thing lead to another, we began to engage in cybersex. Now I'm addicted to her and am super lost and confused.**"
Stress and anxiety Regarding Hookup (am I over worrying),Alwaysgonnask,ainbow,"Hello everyone, I'm writing this to see if I'm honestly just beating myself up for nothing. Roughly 21 days ago I met up with a guy on Grindr, we did the deed (I was the top and he was the bottom) and I wore a condom. As I was pulling out the condom came off (think half out of him and hanging in the wind). He said he was negative and that I shouldn't worry. I didn't get on pep nor am I currently on prep.

Terrified that I caught something I did an Std test (gonorrhea, chlaymidia and syphilis) 6 days later, all of which are negative. I then took two HIV RNA test, one at 8.5 days and the other 10.5 days post exposure and both were negative. I still have this voice in my brain telling me I contracted something and I'm just trying to figure out if it's a justified voice or not. I do have another test (4th gen antibody for HIV) at 24 days post exposure in 2 days. Currently I have no symptoms beyond some stomach pains (which might be stress) and lack of appetite. Am I just worrying myself too much?"
Question About Androsexuality,yond_deputy84,ainbow,"I dont think Im complete straight (heterosexual). Supposedly, Androsexuality may be attraction to someone masculine traits or masculine identity, but the meaning of attraction to male genitals is unpopular. 

I can only be sexually attracted to people with certain genitals, be it men, agender ppl, male-aligned, androgynous, Omni/pan/poly gender, etc. Basically sexual attraction to biological anatomies (no breasts, genitals). Would Androsexuality apply in any way? If not, what would be the right term."

Obviously there are those few actors and fictional characters who are men and are very pretty, but I don't feel the same attraction as my friends. Am I weird for that? Am I still bi? Am I just lesbian? And everytime I actually do feel attraction towards a man, it's usually a fictional character. And the fictional character usually looks feminine or androgynous. And I have absolutely no problem with attraction to women, and I do like women. But it's so weird with men. Help!

Fight for you,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good afternoon my wonderful family.  You brighten my day every time I think about you.  I hope your Monday is going great and your day is filled with happy thoughts.

We all know being lgbtqia+ puts a big neon sign over us that says ""hey look over here im different"". It alerts people that we aren't like them, which leads to bullying, depression, feeling down, and feeling like you're alone in the fight.  You're not alone, but that doesn't mean someone is always gonna be available when you need them.  Sometimes you're going to have to do it for yourself.  You're going to have to cheer yourself up.  You're going to have to stand up to the bully.  You're going to have to get up when you're feeling down.  As much as friends and allies want to help you sometimes they just can't be there so what do you do then.  You fight.  Hopefully not physically but you fight for yourself and your right to be you and love who you love.  No one in this life is going to give you anything.  Politicians have tried to convince us for years the government will take care of us.  You can't rely on anything but yourself.  Fight for you.  Fight for the job. Fight for the love. Fight for equality. Fight damnit just fight.  We will never be equal if we keep waiting on the government to do it for us.  Im tired of waiting i want my life now what about you.  My DM'S are open talk to me.

He then privated the video a few hours after it released, issued an apology.. Seemingly genuine, and released an edited version without either transphobic joke.

What's your take on this? I'm honestly not sure how to feel. It's clear he didn't mean anything harmful by it, he was trying to take the piss out of a transphobic joke. 

But he still went too far with it, in my opinion. And.. Some people really want his head over this.

You're beautiful,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hello my lovely family.  Dad just checking in on you seeing how you are.  I hope you've had a great weekend and are ready for a new week.


Do you know you're beautiful inside and out.  You're unique you're different there's nobody just like you in the world.  Even if you have an identical twin they're differences between you.  This has nothing to do with your sexuality or gender.  This is about you as a person.  Yes those things are a part of what makes you who you are, but its your personality, your drive, your passion, creativity, your ability to love and care in other words the inner you.  That's what im talking about that makes you beautiful and unique.  Looks are great but can fade after awhile but your inner beauty stays true.  Its that inner you that really tells who you are.  It confirms your gender and sexuality.  Its your inner being that shows who you really are.  It lets you know if you're really male or female. It lets you know if your bi, gay, lesbian,queer, ace, nb, etc.  When people say how did you know you were lesbian if you haven't slept with a girl.  Same way you know you're straight and haven't slept with anyone you just know.  Its the inner you that tells you.  You don't need to date someone to know how feel about them.  Never question whether or not you're valid.  Your feelings confirm you're valid.  Never let anyone convince you you're wrong about your sexuality and gender your inner you confirms who you are. Don't deny your feelings accept them and be yourself.  My DM'S are open I'd love to chat

Love
Dad"

Have a great day!"
I finally accepted it,Harlg,ainbow,"I'm finally accepting the fact I'm agender. I'm also bisexual but I've accepted that for a while. I've always never felt any connections to Gender at all, I don't care if people see me as a girl, boy, enby, demiboy, demigirl, etc. I only plan to come out to two people about this, my best friends. They are both on the non binary spectrum so they should hopefully accept me. I don't feel the need to come out to anyone really because I don't care what gender they see me as. I am AFAB so I'll most likely be refered to as a girl most of the time I guess. I don't really care about pronouns, I just don't like neo pronouns. Basically I don't care being referred to as she/her, he/him, or they/them. I don't feel the need to change my name either. I do know my family definitely wouldn't support me, for being agender and bisexual, they are against everything LGBTQ. My boyfriend is straight so idk if he'd feel weird to say his partner is agender. He knows I don't really care about gender identity on myself tho. He's mostly supportive of the LGBTQ community, but he is still kinda phobic to non binary identities, he still respects their pronouns and stuff, but he doesn't think they are ""real"" and doesn't understand it.

I just wanted somewhere to say all this, I've questioned my gender for probably 3 years now, but the questioning got really strong recently. I did suspect I was agender about a year ago but I didn't want to seem ""special"" and just identified as a girl.

I finally did the first step tho, coming out to myself."

The issue I leaned towards earlier is that I love companionship and would love a partner or hell even a fwbshit I would love to just have FRIENDS!  People assume that I have guys knocking my doors down, HAVE to have a significant other in my life, have NO problem in the relationship or love dept, etcwhen its the exact opposite.  So, considering Id honestly love to have someone, friends or just meaningful relationships and everyone assumes I have a plethora of those, its legitimately depressing how alone I actually am and feel.

Cool day,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family its dad sorry for the late check in I've been in an area with no service all day.  I hope your weekend is going good and you are all doing ok.  I love you all very much.

So today we we're in an area in north Georgia called Helen.  It's modeled after a German alpine village.  They have lots of shops to look at as well as river tubing and water parks zipline you name it.  While the kids were doing all of that I was walking around the shops and ran into this group from Atlanta.  They were an lgbtqia+ summer camp.  Kids ranged from 10-16.  They had every color of the rainbow represented and it was obvious they were lgbtqia+ because they were wearing shirts that said the name of the camp in rainbow colors then on the back it had team bi team lesbian team gay team trans etc.  The kids were all happy and being their genuine selves.  I assume they have accepting parents in order to go.  As far as I could tell no one gave them any trouble being lgbtqia+.  It was cool seeing them ready to go tubing because the trans kids were able to dress their right gender.  It was a really cool day.  My DM'S are open if you need to talk.

"i was outed a couple years ago, is it bad i'm still mad at the person that outed me?",TheShadySorcerer,ainbow,"my step sister outed me as bisexual 2 and a half years ago (about) to my mom and step dad. the only people who knew i was bisexual were my step brother, step sister, and my best friend. i was chatting with someone on omegle and told them i was bisexual because they asked. in response, they said liking the same gender was bad and i should be ashamed of myself for liking the same gender. i was a bit more sensitive back then, so i started crying; when i cried, i would always go into my closet for alone time. my mom came downstairs and she asked my step siblings why i was crying. my step sister said, without thinking, that i was bisexual and what had happened.  


about a year after the incident, i asked which one of my step siblings told my mom that i was bisexual and my step brother said my step sister did. i was angry and upset, and still am, but have never told her about my feelings. i'm aware it was an accident, but my step sister said she thought i had already come out (even though i would've told her first; i never told her i came out bc i hadn't).  


then in january 2021 she outed me to my very christian, very old-fashioned grandmother, who told me the same thing the stranger told me, so i cut my grandmother out of my life.  


should i forgive my step sister?  was it wrong of me to cut my grandmother out of my life?"
"best state to live, work, and settle in if you're trans?",esperanzanaut,ainbow,"some background: I'm a binary trans woman with 19 years teaching experience in universities and high schools and a PhD in the humanities.  I'm a foreign language teacher (I teach French, Spanish, and Latin) and consequently I'll be wanting to move to a state where it's not impossible for me to find a job teaching full time in a high school or community college.  I generally ""pass"" and everything, but here's the thing: I'm from Texas, and I'm hoping to move to a state where I can avail myself of an interstate teacher certification reciprocity agreement as well as live in a major city where people aren't going to try to kill me or throw shade at me all the time... and find a job. I need a place of sufficiently capacious parts as to be willing to offer a person like me a teaching job after realising, perhaps, that I'm trans. 

I've kind of thought about California, as I've lived there before, and I like it a lot, but it's very expensive and it's on fire. Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts, Rhode Island I've also made my list, but I know next to nothing about their institutional circumstances, particularly with regard to the quality of education provided for there, and the shape of the job market for a person in my position.

So basically what I'm looking for is a good city where I can have a good work-life balance and not feel like from I'm from another planet or something culturally.  I am on the left politically.

Now I have chronic pain from the rape that happened a year ago, I have no idea what everyone thinks of me, and even if they think of me it's either they pity me or they think I'm a liar. 

My partner is great sometimes, but sometimes she gives me advice when I never even asked for it. It feels like I can't talk to her without her overstepping and telling me how I need to do things better. 

I don't know how to move on. I don't want to get therapy because everyone has been heavily suggesting it to me to the point where it just feels so forced, that I am just in total denial to get it. It's not that I don't want it, it's just people have been overstepping by trying to tell me what I need to do where I feel to pressured where I can't even make a decision. 

I'm not suicidal. Sometimes I just get depressed and I cry almost every day. It is a struggle for me to feel even somewhat normal. 

Even with loosing a support group, and my partner calling me crazy in the heat of a fight or saying how I need therapy, even with people victim blaming me and trying to blame my mental health on why I came out about someone sexually abusing me, I also have to deal with family shit and feeling peer pressured to hang out with my mom's boyfriend who, everytime we hang out with him, he gets shit faced and then mom blames it on me whenever things go South

I'm just so tired of people telling me the wrong things. Blaming me. Or my brother who told me not to talk to an NB kid at his wedding because he didn't want the dad to think we were ""influencing them""

He had gone through years of treatment so far but has finally quit and has turned down any more, besides pain killers. I respect that choice, because ""my body my choice."" But when I said this my mom responded with ""Yeah I would know all about that"" and then gestured to my dad's B-cup breasts that had grown bc of 3 years on estrogen.

This was 100% not the right time to be transphobic, as if there was ever a good time.

Do I need to come out again?,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning family hope you all slept well.  As go out and about today just remember your virtual dad is here rooting for you and giving you all his love.

So I've had a few people asking me about coming out again.  In most cases its like for instance they came out as trans( insert what works for your sexuality or gender) but the family is nit using proper pronouns, they're not using new name its like they're not acknowledging they came out at all.  So they ask my opinion on if they should come out again.  NO! If you communicated clearly that you are trans (or pick the sexuality or gender for your situation) and go by a new name and pronouns and they've had ample time to adjust but appear to be making no effort coming out again isn't going to change it.  They're doing it intentionally.  They're hoping you will either go back in the closet or change your mind.  In the example of trans you keep correcting them firmly but nicely to start.  If you've come out then start dressing your correct gender, wearing makeup whatever it is to show your gender.  DO NOT let it slide even if its family especially if they said they accepted you.  Its up to them to prove they did.  Now there is one exception to coming out again and that's if something has changed.  So lets say you came out as bi but realize you're also trans then yes you need to come out again.  While im on this let me add don't be in a hurry to label yourself especially young people.  Gender and sexuality are fluid and can change especially during puberty.  The last thing you want to do is keep coming out everytime it changes because then it looks like you're just changing to be popular or something. Just wait until you're sure and then come out.  For the record its ok not to label yourself also.  You have fought and stressed and cried over accepting who you are before you came out so you have the right to correct people including family if they get it wrong.  My DM'S are open if you need more clarification on this or if you want to talk.

Love you

I really didnt know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

Words have power,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey guys it's Dad just checking in seeing how your day was. I hope everyone had a great freaking day I hope everything that you wanted came true and that nothing brought you down.

Never underestimate the power of support or an encouraging word. So many people go through the day needing something to pick them up something to encourage them. It's not that hard to offer an encouraging word. It's not that hard to offer your support. I see people all the time on the apps that I use wanting to be validated or wanting to know if they're pretty if they're passable things like that. You would be surprised how much it brightens their day to stop by and honestly let them know your valid u-pass you're beautiful you're worthy you are enough. It also helps them when you offer your support. Let someone know that you're behind them let somebody know that you stand with them let somebody know that you care about them. That's why I post everyday I want you to know I care about you I want you to know that you really are loved that you really are supported. I don't want any doubt in anyone's mind where I stand I try to make a point to tell those that I love I love them on a daily basis and that includes all of you. We in the lgbtqia community lack support from our families already which I've stated before baffles me how a parent can turn their back on a child and stop supporting them just because of who they choose to love. Why should we have to beg support and beg and encouragement from our peers within the community. Love and support should come without any effort that's why I tell you on a daily basis and I really mean it I love and support you guys 100%. Never Never Let It Go unsaid if you see someone that needs encouraging lift them up give them that word of encouragement I don't care if it's on an app like this and a hundred people have already told them what they need to hear it's always good to hear it from one more person.  I hope everybody has a good day and a good night I love you all very much. My DM's are open if anyone would like to talk

Tennessee teen rejected by family,Aldirick1022,ainbow,"My girlfriend and I just got back to knoxville last night. Today we went to our favorite coffee shop South Press. 4 young men came in wearing 'vol means y'all' shirts with the y'all in rainbow colors. One of them started playing the piano and he was very good. Joslynn recorded some of his playing and when asked said he had just come out to his family.

We went over and talked to him. His family had rejected him, he was no longer his brother's best man and was told not to come to the wedding. I told him I was proud of him for being his true self. He cried a little and hugged me. Then I asked him if he would mind me being his adoptive dad. He hugged me again and cried. My girlfriend put a hand on his shoulder and said 'it's okay' he turned and hugged her and said 'thank you mom'.

Top Surgery 6 Week Post Op Update!!,mc_stealth,ainbow,"Hey everyone! I just wanted to share my top surgery 6 weeks post op update video here! If any of you would like to subscribe that would be great. I only need 4 more subscribers and we will be at 600 subscribers which is amazing!! I am so proud of how far I have come in the past couple months. 

I got top surgery at the Womens College Hospital with Dr. John Semple on June 29th, 2021 in Toronto, Ontario. They were an amazing group of people and I am very grateful that I was able to get top surgery with them. Their wait list is longer than what people would hope for but their results are really great. McLean was my first choice in Ontario but for health reasons, I had to go to the WCH so if any complications occurred, I would be safe. 

Anyways, I hope you all have an amazing day and enjoy my video!

Starting an LGBT Youth non-profit as a teenager,archangelo17,ainbow,"I'm not exactly sure where to ask this, but I'm looking for any kind of advice from anyone who thinks they can help: I'm 15 and a (closeted) trans boy, and I want to start a non-profit organization for LGBT youth focusing on support and education. Except, I don't have any of the knowledge on how to really do this. My Catholic school doesn't have a GSA, but just a Diversity club that entirely ignores the LGBTQ+ community, but the neighboring Catholic school does. Also, my age really limits what I can do, since I can't drive anywhere, sign paperwork, etc. I was thinking of making a website with resources and trying to partner with a bigger foundation (like HRC and GLSEN) so that I could collect donations for them. I would love to hold fundraisers and work with local support groups, but that would require more involvement from my parents (something I wish to mostly avoid), so I can wait until I get my license for that. I am so clueless about how to actually *do* this since I also don't have any friends I can rely on to work with. This is a stressful situation for me because I have no adult/mentor/someone actually experienced to help me, but I also don't want to drop the idea. Should I reach out to a major organization first? Or should I contact local support groups and my neighboring school's GSA? Sorry for the very unorganized word vomit. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm a 15 yo with no experience with organizing things but I want to start an LGBT youth foundation. Any advice?"
"confused, need advice!",_failedabortion,ainbow,"hi so ive been out as bisexual since i was about maybe 14, or even 13. im almost 20 now, almost two years out of highschool and still have the same bf from high school weve been on and off since i was 16, and our official year is coming up again, but even just five months into this i was questioning if im a lesbian, bc ive been realizing all my past experiences w men (sexual or not) have all been catered towards their needs, and ive mistaken my anxiety/feeling of being grossly uncomfy around them for butterflies, and i never want them, i want them to want me their validation is what i want not even so much their attention, and just anytime were intimate i hate it, i hate kissing him, holding his hand, having s*x all of that, i found myself wishing he didnt want sex and we could just chill as friends but hes my bf, so yk.. and i find myself having to convince myself to be intimate w him because its been a while or bc thats how hell know you like himand then after ill feel so gross especially during every feeling im portraying is all fake and i cant help but think how gross i am, and i dont know what to do.. its not like he deserves an explanation hes cheated, lied, put his hands on me. but i just want to be okay w myself, and i dont ugh, when i came out to my mom as bi she freaked and pretends im not to this day cs at least in her head theres a chance of me being w a man, so what if i am and i come out to her and everything is ruined, our relationship just got better it was hell for five years, and i know this would break her and just be an inconvenience to those around me(and by those around me i just mean my bf n mom,my moms a big part in my life, but! i do have supportive friends although none of them are aware of these thoughts but ik they wouldnt judge me) im just so tired, and growing up thinking i wanted to be with men bc i just wanted someone to love and protect me when in reality i just wanted a father"

Its my journey,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hello my wonderful and fabulous family.  Its dad of course checking in making sure life's treating you kind and your doing ok.


So I want to remind everyone tonight first off that you are valid from the L to the + wherever you are in the alphabet mafia you're valid.  O remind you of that because its so easy to think well im not bi enough or trans enough or gay or nb enough etc.  Honey whatever you identify as is enough.  There is no mark that you have to meet to LGBTQ enough.  If you're bi and you have preference it doesn't matter the percentage of each you're bi enough.  If you're gay or lesbian but haven't slept with same sex yet you're still enough.  If you're trans but don't think you pass you're still enough.  While im talking about trans let me say something to my trans family. Its something i tell me trans niece mtf.  When i was losing weight people would tell me all the time i looked thinner but i never saw it right away.  It was because i see me every day.  The change to my eyes was so gradual i couldn't see it but others could.  You may think you don't pass when others say you do.  Its for the same reason your eyes see the change so gradually because you see you every day others don't so to them its a huge change. Don't get discouraged if you don't see it right away.  Trust what others are telling you they see it clearer than you will.  For the rest of us.  STOP comparing your sexuality and gender experience to others they're never going to be the same.  Instead realize this is your journey and its your experience no one can tell you how it should be but you.  You are enough to be whatever it is you feel you are.  Don't try fitting in someone elses mold instead create you're own.  My DM'S are very much open to all who need me.

Love you all so much

Are 'kindergender' people actually children?,PresentLook6070,ainbow,"According to the LGBTA wikia, Kindergender or Impulgender is a xenogender where a person identifies as a young child. Do you think that Kindergendered people are actually children, and do you think they should be allowed to have relationships with people belonging to the age group that they identify as (ie, a Kindergendered person identifies as a 10 year old, and wants to have a relationship with a 10 year old)?"
First Time Dating an Asexual and I am Confusion,Bexkayhn,ainbow,"Okay so I'm a polyamorous pansexual and have a lot of sexual energy. I am very attracted to this person I am dating.  When they first messaged me, they said they had identified as asexual in the past but due to a change in medications were feeling less ace. They messaged me out of the blue on Lex and later said it was because they were feeling really horny and thought I was cute (based on my profile....no pictures). We had sex after the first date and I could tell they were super into me but (without going into too much detail) their body didn't really respond and we ended up with them just going down on me a little bit but I couldn't really tell if they were doing it because they wanted to (they said they did) or because they felt like they needed to give me something after going to all the trouble of getting each other undressed (something I would have totally done in the past before I started going to therapy so maybe I am just projecting). Neither of us orgasmed but that's not super unusual for me and the sex such as it was still felt very intimate and I didn't leave feeling at all unsatisfied. We have had two more dates since, and they still seem attracted to me and like kissing me but they seem uncomfortable with a lot of touching and haven't seemed interested in sex at all. They then revealed that they had switched medications again. I've always been very touchy-feely in romantic relationships and even though I know they are just not like that and am being very careful not to overstep any boundaries or pressure them into anything, I find myself constantly questioning whether they actually like me romantically or just want to be my friend and don't know how to tell me that. I feel insecure every time they choose to sit farther from me or unwind from a cuddle. They said they want to see a psychiatrist again to find a different medication so that they can have sex with me again, and I want that too, but I don't know if they mean it or are just saying it because they think that's what I want. I'm solo poly and we have had that discussion and they are cool with it, so it's not like they think they need to be my only source of romantic or sexual interaction. I know asexuality is a spectrum and sexual desire fluctuates for everyone, myself included, but I'm catching feelings and I don't want to keep going down that road with them if it's going to end in me just forever pining for a friend who can't want me like I want them. I want to ask them straight up what they want from me but there are so many changes going on in their life right now, medications included, so I'm guessing they might not really know either. Anyway, I'm not really sure what I really want from this post... Maybe I need someone to tell me I'm not ready for this relationship? Or that I should wait it out and at worst end up with a good friend that I'm attracted to? Or just that my confusion is understandable or relatable or just a product of my own anxiety and insecurities? IDK I AM A CONFUSED SAPPHIC MESS"

A boy likes me Im AroAce and I dont know what to do (Hes like the sweetest person I know and I dont want to lose what we have),Realistic-Total-7250,ainbow,"
I know for sure Im Ace but Ive always wondered whether or not Im AroAce or not cause I have like severe childhood trauma (like I went through horrible shit like sexual assault,physical abuse and emotional abuse by my family members) so I dont understand it when people are nice to me so I immediately want to sleep with them as a way to show appreciation (I know its fucked up) its not like an attracted to them it just feels like Im compelled to do that
Anyways Ive slept with a lot of people not cause I was attracted to them cause I felt I owed them that for being nice to me
Till I met this guy named Bash hes like super pretty and me and him just hit it off I thought I liked him cause I just wanted to spend all my time with him, I think hes Ace but he hasnt figured it out yet. When I started talking to me he was like he doesnt like sex but he likes kissing and cuddling and stuff, that was new for me since most guys I talk to just want to sleep with me. So we spent more time and talking and we have so much in common, we finally met up in person it was awkward at first but we started talking and stuff then he kissed me it was a great kiss but I felt nothing, Im sad cause in that moment I realized I want to like him but I cant. I obviously didnt tell him cause I feel he wont understand where Im coming from 
I want to spend more time with him so I dont think I bring it up, its not like Im sex repulsed so the kissing doesnt bother me so I guess Ill go with it. The only problem is I think he notices Im not into it cause hes always asking me whether its okay and I keep saying yes
The whole question is I like him as a friend but he likes me more and I dont want to lose our connection"

Raise your voice,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family its dear old dad just checking in on you seeing how your day was.  Remember I love you I support you and together we can do this thing called life. 

I want to talk to you tonight about the power you have.  Now you may be saying or thinking you can't have power you're still in the closet or you're just a kid what can I do etc.  The power you have is your voice.  You can choose to use it or you can choose to remain silent its up to you.  I choose to use my power everyday on social media platforms like this one for example.  Its not much but its one way I fight for the community.  You have that same power.  You may be thinking but im only one voice.  That's where you're wrong.  You're not just one voice your voice is added to the others already fighting makes us even stronger.  You think one person can't make a difference try playing any sport one man short it makes a huge difference.  We have a mission for equality and the more people we have yelling for that cause the better we're heard.  Imagine this walk into an empty arena anywhere by yourself stand at the very top and imagine trying to communicate to someone on the field its tough they cant hardly hear you.  Now gradually keeping adding one person all saying the same thing until the arena is full no trouble hearing now.  We all need to unite in one voice for lgbtqia+ equality until we get it.  A single whisper may not be heard thousands whispering the same thing sounds like a shout.  We all must fight for equality if we all want equality.  So remember silence = the death of a cause action= strengthening of the cause.  My DM'S are open if you need me."

My mom was really mad and said Ive been influenced by social media and my friends (I have in total one gay friend, who is my girlfriend). But it is exactly what I fear myself; fearing Ive been influenced to be gay. Ive prayed so much, cried so much, felt so disgusting. I always want to kiss my girlfriend and Ive spent the night with her, I plan things out just so I have a chance to kiss her. But then I think what if Im just faking it? What if I dont actually like it? Is any of this gay at all? Its so frustrating because who would I play this act for. I could just get a boyfriend if I wanted. But I feel like the entirety of Gen Z is cursed to feel like theyve been influenced instead of allowed to feel their feelings. Why cant I just believe how I feel? Does anyone else relate?"

I don't know everyone's age here or where you are in life.  I like to keep my posts suitable for everyone kids and parents alike.  I want to make them where everybody gets something out of it even if you're not lgbtqia+ you are a supporter or have someone who is lgbtqia+ or you're questioning your sexuality or gender.  Either way I hope my posts help.  This is not the only platform I use so on some of my other apps I see a lot of parents asking things like my son or daughter of varying ages im not gonna list them all just came to me and told they are _______ ( fill in the blank with anything from the alphabet mafia) what do I do?   So I thought I would share what I did when my kids came out maybe it will help.  Kids btw if I miss something you would like your parents to do let me know.  So first and foremost you accept them.  They are still your child regardless of who they love.  Most parents are looking more for how to support.  When my kids came out btw I have one trans one lesbian one bi.  When they came out I hugged them and simply said I love you nothing changes that im bi so I understand what you're going through we don't have to talk but if you want to im here now let's go shopping.  I took them shopping because sometimes when you come out you want a new look or a new hairstyle take them help them.  Kids are looking for validation from you.  Next I periodically maybe couple times a week simply remind them they can come to me anytime.  Next begin to educate yourself on lgbtqia+ their specific sexuality and gender of course but also just in general.  Its good information to have because they may date someone who identifies differently and its good to know something about it.  Allow them within reason to explore but remember the worlds scary I make sure mine are well prepared should things get intimate ( message me if you need to know more).  The main thing is just being there.  There's going to be breakups and heartaches just like hetero relationship so be prepared.  My DM'S are open if you want to talk further or add anything i missed.

Silver Linings Playbook and the Closet,rbrown3316,ainbow,"Tonight, I watched Silver Linings Playbook for about the 5th time. Something about the love story between Pat and Tiffany captures my heart. The idea that two broken souls found each other in the depths of their darkness and overcame their desperation/circumstances together is special. As a gay closeted kid, romance portrayed like this is something that I can only dream of. Although Ive never experienced romance or love myself, my circumstances as a gay kid have left me feeling broken out of the gates. While I havent dealt with a spouse cheating on me like Pat or a spouse dying suddenly like Tiffany - I mean, I havent even had a boyfriend - the loneliness of the closet can feel like a tragedy in and of itself. The shame that Ive experienced because of my feelings, the uncertainties about my future, the sense of doom that I will never find someone to share a life with or that, even if I find that someone, Ill live in constant judgement from those around me all feel like tragedies. While others - like Pat and Tiffany - have to experience real heartbreak to develop these feelings of hopelessness, I feel like just being gay, even in todays more accepting climate, is enough to become jaded, even before the chance for heartbreak arises. I wonder if other gay closed kids whove never experienced love feel the same way - that somehow theyve started out broken. Still, this movie and the love story between the two characters gives me hope that even if we feel broken now, the future for us holds something better and brighter. Maybe, my circumstances - and the circumstances of other gay kids - will make our love or relationships in the future that much sweeter because we had to overcome a shared darkness first."

Advice on where i stand,closetalt1848,ainbow,"Hey guys! I (m15) have recently been engaging a-lot more in this community and have finally found and accepted myself as being gay. Now, its time to start thinking about coming out

Now, i plan on first coming out to my closest friends, as one of my best friends is openly trans and another came out as gay a month ago. It went well, the whole group genders my friend properly and nothing has changed for my other friend.

The issue is where to stand on coming out to my parents. Im sure they would be somewhat ok i think? Im not really sure. I do live in an middle class northern town but my parents arent the most emotional people.

My mom loves me more than anything, and i would be safe coming out, but my dad is a downright asshole for most things and could be a jerk if he is homophobic.

Im just worried that my mom would be disappointed as she expects grandchildren as i am currently the end of her bloodline.

Another thing is that my parents never have really brought up, or at-least had a conversation about gay people, and have not heard them talk about them in a positive or negative light.

One last thing is that i know my parents, or at-least my mom is transphobic (kinda). In preparation, i brought an convo on in the car yesterday about trans people and she said she is completely for equal rights and is fine with trans people, but is mainly worried about trans women in womens sports, and said some transphobic things that obviously makes it clear she does not see trans women as women at all.

Now all this to say she is weirded out by it, and my worry is that she may believe some stereotypes (gay people acting fem/crossdressing) and not accept me for that.

Plus, forgot to mention, that I am interested in that like, being more feminine. so.. fuck. That definitely comes after coming out as gay tho lmao

Idk. Im just stressed out. What do you think? How would she take the news?"

My inspiration,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey I hope everyone is having a great day so far.  I hope its been the start of a great weekend.  I love you all and support you always.


So today I was getting a pedicure and my toenails painted.  Its something I enjoy doing for me.  Now honestly in the past I have been stared at, whispered about and even called weird for doing it.  Today as I was in the chair an older gentleman in his early 60's i guessed was seated next to me.  Now I never flat out assume anyone is going to be rude but when you've been out of the closet as long as I have you learn to at least be prepared for it.  Well I noticed he kept staring as the lady took the old paint off and I could see his wheels turning in his mind.  Then when she started with the new color he was staring again.  Well you know me im going to speak so I said what color are you getting.  He said honestly I don't have the courage you do.  I said what do you mean.  He said I've been gay but never come out and I've always wanted my toes painted but was afraid of what others would think.  Now mind you we're whispering because he's nervous.  I said look around do you see how many people are watching me get my nails painted.  He said yes about half the salon.  I said right here's how  I look at it.  Some are curious some are disgusted and others think its cool.  In my mind I believe they all think its cool and im setting a new trend.  I told him my fear of what others thought held me back for awhile.  Then one day about 25 years ago I realized it.  I then decided the only opinion on things like this that matter are mine.  From that day on I dressed how I wanted and painted my nails.  He then shocked me by asking what color he should try.  I picked a neutral beige kinda color didn't want to overwhelm him lol.  He then paid for my pedicure and hugged me.  I know some of you have parents that aren't supportive so don't use this next piece of information on them without preparing for the consequences.  We cannot let the fear of what people think of us hold us back.  Who gives a shit if everyone doesn't like me or makes fun of me.  Their opinion is just that their opinion.  Once you really take hold of that notion you can do like I did laugh when they make fun of you it absolutely drives them crazy.  Family you never know what is going through peoples mind.  I thought he was probably going to be a homophobe turns out he was in awe seeing someone do what he had always wanted to do.  You never know what little thing will inspire someone.  My job has a dress code with very little room for self expression.  My toenails are my queer way of being me.  Yours may inspire someone to.  My DM'S are open lets chat tonight let me know your queer forms of expression.

Love you and your individuality

Scared of being a transtrender.,nachonaco,ainbow,I think I'm a transgender male.  I wouldn't mind being called Shawn instead of Sydney and I am nonbinary.  I bought a binder after finding out I could safely wear them.  What if I'm really a transtrender?  What if I end up taking hormones and it fucks up my body?
"This isn't my ""entire identity"" you know",emipyon,ainbow,"I wanted to share my thoughts about this before when a certain US elected official (I'm not gonna mention her name because she doesn't deserve any more attention, but Jewish Space Lasers) spew this rhetoric before, but I didn't get around to it then. Anti-LGBTQ+ ""activists"" love to frame it as if LGBTQ+ people are just basing their existence around being queer; ""why do you have to turn it into your entire identity?"" .

I, and I would barter the vast majority of LGBTQ+ people don't make it into ""their entire identity"", you are the ones who do! It's not like I wanted to have to deal with this stuff in the first place, I didn't choose it because I needed a hobby, I'm plenty occupied as it is. But that said, it's an important thing of who I am (as I'm sure it's to most straight cis people as well), and the reason why it's so important is because it affects my life regardless of whether I want to or not, and that's not something I or any other queer person chose. It's only because other people decided some people should be treated as lesser beings because of who they are. Do you really think people would make such a big deal of being queer if it had no impact on how society treated them?

Framing it as if this is all I am is also a really sneaky way of dehumanizing queer people. Once you learn somebody is queer, nothing else about them matters anymore, and they're just a ""degenerate"" pervert. You wouldn't really know if we have a lot of hobbies, interests or beliefs in common. Of course, when you go to a queer space (like a pride event or a queer forum online), people mainly talk about their experience being queer. It's like going going to /r/baseball and being stunned everything they talk about is baseball. But I exist outside of this space as well. On reddit this is mostly what I talk about, but I have other social media accounts where I don't. In fact the reason I don't is that it doesn't always feels safe talking about this or outing yourself, so there's no wonder why you need a safe space. I have no doubt the bigots really understand this, but they need the rhetoric to dehumanize LGBTQ+ people and propagate their misconceptions.

Another way this is harmful is how stigmatized and discriminated minority groups are shamed for talking about how they are mistreated by society. The only ""good queers"" are the ones who never speak up or let anybody know who they are and their experiences. They want a society in which you just sweep these issues under the rug; ""out of sight out of mind"". It's why people like that get upset by things like BLM. They don't get upset over the reasons why these movements are needed, they just hate when people point it out.

So no, my ""entire identity"" isn't based around being queer, but that doesn't mean it's an important part of who I am, if you took it away that wouldn't be me anymore, that would be incomplete and a lie. You want me to be ashamed about who I am and to hide it, that's what I've done most my life. Is it really a wonder why when people are finally coming out all those parts of themselves that have stayed hidden for so long are so much more important not to let anybody take away from you anymore?"

Future generations,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning hope everyone slept well last night.  Dad checking in making sure everyone is ok and reminding you I love you.

So last night I was at a local grocery store and i overheard a couple of friends if mine talking.  Both are in their mid 20's so much younger than I am.  One lady is lesbian the other is bi.  They were talking and saying if they had kids they hope they don't turn out LGBTQ like they are to avoid all the hate and bullying they went through.  While I understand what they mean they don't see how much better its gotten.  30 years ago it was way worse when I came out and it was better then than in the 1960's when it all began.  It breaks my heart to hear our community actually wishing people wouldn't turn out like us.  Im proud of who I am and I know I was born this way I had no control over it just like every other LGBTQ person out there.  Instead of worrying about the next generation facing what we face lets fight to make it better before they get here.  Lets elect leaders who don't worry about reelection but instead worry about the people.  Lets educate people to the differences rather than write the off as hopeless.  Lets fight to change gender norms and gender roles.  Lets get leaders in the community that promote unity not division.  Lets make a better tomorrow for the generations behind us so we no longer have to worry about what they will face.  The truth is politicians or society is not going to do it for us.  We are going to have to work and fight for it ourselves.  My DM's are open to anyone that needs me.

Questioning my gender and could use some help,Toasty647,ainbow,"First some info on me, I am 21, AMAB, and look very masculine (6'1"", no problem growing a beard, massive size 15 feet, broad shoulders, etc). Overall I'd say I'm pretty apathetic towards my masculinity, I've never had any problems with it, but it's also never brought me joy. I've always had the occasional thought of wondering what life would be like if I was born a girl. But within the past few weeks I've started to really question my gender.

I think having a feminine body would give me a happiness I haven't gotten from my masculinity, but I don't think I like the idea of being called a woman or being referred to with feminine pronouns. This could just be that I haven't ever been referred to with feminine pronouns, but I don't know.

If yall could give me any insight or ways to explore my gender identity in private (I live in the deep south and don't feel comfortable talking about this with people I know yet) I'd really appreciate it"

Hey family dad checking in just seeing how everyone's doing hope everyone has had a great day today and just know I love you and I'm here to support you in any way I can.

Family I'm going to go ahead and tell you that what I'm going to talk to you about tonight has just Plum got me mad. Now I have tried to find a date on this I don't know if this happened today or a few weeks ago or whatever but it's something I saw on a news report today. Supposedly there is a store owner in a town in Washington State has issue with a member of that City's Council who happens to be a trans woman his main problem is he does not believe trans people are legitimate he believes they are attention Seekers and nothing more than abominations to God. His hatred has gone so far that he has put a sign up in the window of his store facing the street that says and I quote ""if you have a dick you're not a chick"". Well naturally and rightly so this has offended this woman tremendously and she confronted him about it and there's a video on YouTube of their heated back and forth argument. He tells her that the only reason she's mad is because nobody has bothered to stand up to her before although he refuses to call her her he still calls her him. She tries on many occasions to tell him that trans women are indeed women and for the record let me State my opinion they are women! The store owner of course never sees it her way he continues to deny that trans women are women and that not only is transexuals Abominations to God but so are any member of lgbtqia+. I am fine with people having a difference of opinion if you want to come to me and tell me that you believe bisexuality is wrong that it's your opinion but you're going to let me live my life as I want to that's fine but when you try to control and get it my face and argue with me about it then I have a problem. At that point it is no longer just your opinion you are trying to convince me I'm wrong. I'm old enough and wise enough to know there's never going to be an end completely to hatred such as homophobia racism transphobia Etc. But we need to be doing all we can to get rid of as much of it as possible. If we can just get to the point for people with this hatred are content enough to leave people alone will be better off than we are now.  Although im not even sure that's possible.  Thank you for letting me rant tonight.

Love
Dad"

"why am I so interested in some transgender stories? please help, thanks so much..",Fit_Highlight4790,ainbow,"First thing I'll mention is that I have OCD. But I honestly hate myself right now for being this ""weird."" I'm crying right now as I'm writing this because someone told me in an r/asktransgender thread that I definitely don't sound cis and repeated to write out the reasons. I am basically 100% sure I am cis but their comment still made me worry that I'm in denial. I know I'm not though. 

I love being female. I have never questioned my gender, I see my future as female, etc. Sure I was a tomboy and maybe went through a boy phase when I was 3. But the thought of being male actually makes me uncomfortable. If anything, I can relate to MTF stories more. I love my life as a girl, puberty actually made me feel more feminine and I loved it. I can't relate to guys, like I know I'm a girl for sure.

This is something that I just need to get off my chest. I have like two different feelings about transgender people. A friend transitioned and it made me feel uncomfortable at first. I felt guilty because I was supportive but it was weird watching them become the other gender. Then I sort of forced myself to imagine myself becoming the opposite gender (not to test myself, but to make myself feel uncomfortable). Eventually I got over it and realized ""hey, they're just a different gender."" This was when I was younger. 

Transgender things are everywhere in the media. I have a very empathetic personality. I WANT people to feel included. It makes me feel good to see trans people passing. But lately I realized I might have a slight interest in transgender stories, especially teenagers that socially transitioned when they were younger and pass well. Seeing them fit in makes me fill with pride. And I don't know why I'm slightly obsessed with it. I feel creepy. When I suggested that I seem more ""drawn"" to FTM stories, someone suggested that this was ""evidence that I need to transition to male."" Currently, one of my characters in my novel is a cute FTM teenage boy who NO ONE knows is trans and for some reason I'm obsessed with this plot. I never used to be bothered why I liked creating it until someone suggested that it may be a reflection of who I want to become - BUT IT'S NOT!! I'M NOT FTM. I don't have the desire of wanting to be a boy. I think it's a combination of my attraction to guys and empathy. I don't really know.

Help!"
"Anxiety and dread over potential exposure, what's wrong with me",Alwaysgonnask,ainbow,"Hi everyone, about 13 days ago I hooked up with someone on Grindr. I'm a top, wore a condom and finished in the condom but as I was pulling out the condom came off. I couldn't tell if it came off before I fully pulled out or as I was, so I'm stressing about potential exposure. The condom didn't break nor was there any blood (I know microscopic tears can occur). The bottom said he was negative and didn't have anything (I know clean isn't the right word to use) but Grindr being Grindr I don't know how much of that to believe. I am not on prep. He also said he usually plays safe and only sometimes plays raw (I am taking this with a grain of salt)

I stupidly didn't even think of getting on pep and now I'm stressing hard that I caught something. I've been googling symptoms (Haven't had a fever but had a bout of diarrhea 12 days after the incident) and transmission rates for days and been stressing out. I ended up getting an Sti test 6 days after the hook up (Chlaymidia, gonorrhea and syphilis all negative) as well as an rna HIV test (at roughly 8.5 days after exposure and it came back negative) and I'm beating myself up for not being more careful. I know I'll have to get another done in 3/4 weeks in order to make sure results are valid. I just keep thinking to myself ""you've got every sti now great job idiot"" and I know that's not good for mental health nor my physical health. Is there any advice on how to help with the stress and anxiety of waiting?"
"worried I want to BE a guy (I'm attracted to guys), but I don't think I do. Help?",Fit_Highlight4790,ainbow,"I'm an 18 year old girl and I've dealt with HOCD (fear that I'm a lesbian in denial) and other types of OCD, so that's something that could be impacting this.

I had my first crush on a boy when I was 11. After that, I had several other crushes on guys. I'm very supportive of LGTBQ and have been mostly successful of getting rid of HOCD. There's just always something about boys emotionally or physically that I've been very attracted to, and that makes me never see myself having a crush on a girl or pursuing a relationship with one.

Anyways, my latest obsession seems to be around wondering if I want to BE the boys I'm attracted to, and if I'm really just envious of them, since I'm really ""boy crazy"". Like, he's so hot, what if I want to be him, not kiss him? If I was actually male I'd still be attracted to those guys, but I'd want to be them as well (do both). But if I imagine myself in a relationship with myself AS a guy, it's just not how I feel. I want to be a girl and that feels natural. Being a guy would almost make me feel uncomfortable, yet my thoughts are like: is that really true...??

Something that isn't helping is that up until I was 6, I was a huge tomboy and even went through a phase where I wanted to BE a boy, which I know isn't anything unusual for young children. I would daydream of myself as this male character. However, I've always been happy as a girl, never questioned my gender, and have said: ""gosh I love being a girl"" to myself before. Being female just feels right. And being WITH a guy is something I do desire.

I go through phases as a kid and got really curious about transgender people (I forget who came out and started this).... I have always had a ton of empathy (not saying this to brag, just explains personality) and I'd feel for all these trans people, especially trans kids or teenagers. I'd follow their stories and I guess it made me so happy to see them being who they are. While I can relate to MTF trans peoples stories more (makes sense because I'm a girl I guess), I seemed more interested in FTM stories. I even have had a crush on a FTM guy. Then, I started worrying my ""interest"" was creepy or that it was because I'd want to be FTM if I was better looking, taller, etc.... But I really just think it's because I happen to be genuinely attracted to them.I love cis guys too, so it's not like I'm exclusively attracted to trans guys or anything....

If anyone can offer any insight that would be helpful. Thanks!"

How do I know,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Well good evening family is dad checking in hoping you had a great day. I just can't go a day without checking in on you making sure everyone's doing all right make sure everyone knows that they're loved and make sure everyone knows that I'm here to support you.

I think probably one of the most asked questions I have is how do I know if I'm lesbian, or gay, or bisexual, or trans, or intersexed, or asexual, or any other gender or sexuality you can think of. I get asked that in some form or fashion pretty much on a daily basis and I honestly don't mind at all I don't want you to think that's where this is going. I am hoping to answer that question in a post to help everyone out at one time. There are a lot of people who have been told that in order to figure out their sexuality or who they're attracted to that they've got a sleep with somebody of the same sex or same gender or whatever as they are. That is not true. All you need in this humble man's opinion to know whether or not you're bisexual or gay or lesbian or whatever is not to have sex with someone of the same gender or same sexuality or whatever you want to say, the way to know is just to have an attraction to that person. Lets say you're wanting to know if you're bisexual sexually attracted to at least two or more genders it does not have to be male and female it can be female and nb it can be male and androgenous it can be whatever. The question is are you sexually attracted to at least two or more genders if so you could be bisexual at the very least biromantic. Same for if you want to know if you're lesbian or gay the question here is am I attracted to the same sex and gender that I am. You don't have to have sex with them first to know for sure you just have to be attracted physically and sexually to that person. Let's go a little deeper and different what about being transgender. I will have to admit now I'm no expert here I do have a nephew who is beginning the process so if I give any information that incorrect please let me know. But from what I see in order to be transgender you have to believe you were born the wrong gender to begin with so whatever your gender was at Birth or assigned at Birth as you will if you feel like it's wrong then you're probably transgender. So if you were assigned male at Birth but you believe you should have been female then you are trans female the opposite is true if you were assigned female at Birth but believe you should have been male then your trans male. You don't necessarily have to have dysmorphia although a lot of trans people do you don't have to fully transition some people are satisfied with just dressing and presenting as the sex opposite they were born whatever is comfortable for you that's what you go for. Niw I'm not going to give examples of all the different genders and all the different sexualities here it would be an entirely too long post. What I will say is if you have specific questions about your gender or sexuality please feel free to message me I will answer as best as possible.  Just remember Don't try to compare yourself to other people who are going through what you're going through your journey and your experience is different than theirs  don't let them influence or sway how you feel. My DM's are open feel free to message me if you want.

Love you
Dad"

I've been coming across a fair few lgbtq+ people who really dislike other lgbtq+ people and the community in general. How do you deal with such people?,StephensInfiniteLoop,ainbow,"Has anyone else experienced this? How do you deal with it? This has happened too many times to count, but some examples: I recently matched with a gay person who said they don't like gay people, because they are too dramatic. When I (calmly) called them out on this, they accused me of being dramatic, and proving their point(!) And I know a transgender woman who says she doesn't like gay men because the majority of them are transphobic (very silly sweeping generalisation, I know). And, in fact this same transgender woman is now also complaining about the trans community, because they complain about their problems too much.

Can we use the label homophobic in such cases? Or is it not really possible for a lgbtq+ person to be homophobic? Or perhaps lgbtq+ people have a right to complain about lgbtq+ people? I find it really upsetting and frustrating, and I just wanted to vent, and share, and hopefully see that I am not alone."

All I did was blow him and he ejaculated on my face and a little in my mouth. I havent had anything since to feel like Im off. I havent had a sexual partner since so would I have noticed something by now?

I never thought of it till now and Im starting to freak out a bit. I see the risks are low for oral HIV transmission so would it be worth it to get tested? Would I have known by now something is wrong with me? And are the home tests accurate if I do get one

My brother loves his videos (including the homophobic ones) and sends them to me sometimes. He recently sent me a video posted a week ago titled When theyre trans-racial.

Together we achieve more,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good evening family dad just checking in on you making sure you had a good day and are still doing okay remind you as always that you are loved and so very special.

You know when I first came out at the age of 14 the lgbtq community was so warm and so welcoming and so supporting I don't know how I would have made it through without them. People that I met along the way family members that were in the community friends that I found out later were in the community all we're just so very supportive. Here lately however I've been noticing that some members of the community are trying to down other members of the community. They feel certain groups shouldn't be included in or are not as valid as other groups and it just breaks my heart. You know this life we live is hard enough on its own without adding any more turmoil to it. Then to think when we come out that people within the community that we think should be supporting us are actually putting us down. We are at a critical point in lgbtqia community one wrong move could set us back years and that wrong move could come in the form of not supporting each other. We need to all band together and support each other whether you particularly agree with somebody or not, my sexuality your sexuality my gender your gender they're all personal to us and they're not going to be exactly the same so if my version of bisexuality doesn't line up with yours there's no need to hate on me we can all be different and still get along. The kids that are coming along nowadays are confused and hurt enough dealing with homophobic parents and community. They should be able to rely on us for love support and Outreach when they need it how can we properly do that if we're fighting with one another over who should and shouldn't belong in the community. Now I want to make one simple statement I don't care who is in the community as long as they're not child molesters short of that everybody can join I don't care where you're at in lgbtqia as far as I'm concerned you're valid and you have my support. Yes most of what I post on here is about trying to be a dad and support those whose parents don't support them but we need to support each other child and adult alike this community can grow and grow and grow beyond anything we ever thought could be but not if we keep fighting each other. I want everyone reading this tonight to know you have my support and my love 100% regardless if you're bisexual lesbian gay asexual whatever it doesn't matter to me you have my love and you have my support. How many other members in the lgbtqia community are willing to say that. Are you willing to put your differences aside and realize that we all need to stand together if we're ever going to be accepted. My DM'S are open for anyone who needs to talk who needs support who needs to know that they are loved and who needs to know that they are accepted.

Love you always Dad"

Check out my wife's new book on gender for toddlers,Waste_Location_3538,ainbow, 
"Had to out myself at Walmart, but it went well",halfhalfling,ainbow,"So apparently starting this month Walmart (at least in my area) is checking a photo ID for everyone who picks up a prescription from the pharmacy. Ive been picking up my partners prescriptions for years, since I work in an office in town and she travels all over. I went in to pick up her latest prescription and the cashier asks for my ID after I gave her my partners name and birthdate. I explained I wasnt her, and the cashier said that was fine she just needed to know my relationship to her for their files. I had a moment of internal panic. I know I could have lied, said we are roommates, etc, but I wanted to be truthful so I blurted out that we were together and owned a house together but werent legally married. She probably didnt need all that detail, but I didnt know if I had said the wrong thing if I wouldnt have been able to pick up her prescriptions anymore. Thankfully, she just smiled at my nervous word vomit and processed my ID without blinking an eye. 

If I had been in a different town, or gotten a different cashier, I cant help but think that could have gone differently. As it is, Im so grateful. I know public opinion about queer issues is changing for the better, especially among the younger generation, but moments like that still catch me off guard. Im hoping everyone in the future can have people around them react the same way as that cashier when a queer person is accidentally put in a situation where they out themself."
Is it only in brazil or are gays nowadays just wanting sex?,mysteriousboy69,ainbow,"I still dream of love, rough right?"
Thank you,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Well good morning it is dear old dad just checking in to see how everyone is doing. I want to tell you how appreciative I am of all the support I received yesterday on my post it really made me feel good to see how many people's lives are being touched by just my simple words. My goal when I started this has not changed. My intention then and my intention now is still to help those who no longer have parents who are supportive. I said yesterday and I meant it that if my post only stopped one person from ending their life or doing something drastic then it was worth it all. Being lgbtqia Plus is not an easy Life to Live especially as children. All kids rely on their parents for love support and an occasional kick in the butt when needed. I cannot explain or offer a reason why when kids come out parents all of a sudden become non supportive but it's more frequent than we want to know. That is why I started making these post and some of you responded Yesterday by saying the post did just exactly what I want them to do. I know being an online parent is not the same thing as being the real parent but it does at least provide you with some support and we all know in this life we need support. So if you need to contact me and get some fatherly advice or just need to talk or you have questions about your sexuality or gender I can't promise I'll have all the answers but I can promise I'll listen and I will be supported. As a community lgbtqia should surround each other and love each other and support each other never tearing anyone down. I want you to know if you message me this is a safe place anything you talk about anything you're concerned about is kept right here never to be shared. Again I want to thank you for all the love that was shown yesterday it was not the reason that I made the post but it was good to know that you all care.

Love always

I think the new guy I'm dating is bi sexual?,Proper_Ad_1771,ainbow,"I am a straight woman who started dating this guy about s month ago, 12 years older (in his mid 30's) I don't want to sound ignorant so I thought this forum would help broaden my mind. Let's call this man Jon

There's been a few things that have lead me to believe he's bi. On our second date he sent a photo of me to his family saying we were dating, which was very fast for me. Now its starting to feel like he told his family so they see he was with a woman.

He made a new friend from work, they work out of town and Share a room, this co-worker (lets call him Chris) is openly gay. Jon was telling me that others sexual preference is not his business but that he doesn't think its right to be gay, as a ""straight"" man. But then Chris showed him a a picture of him in drag and Jon told me he tought Chris actually looked good in drag.

Chris had invited Jon to a gay club, and Jon was going to go, even invited me to go with them. In the end he didn't go.

Jon likes to send me selfies, they other day he told me that he had taken some selfies on Chris' phone that he wanted to send me.

Chris has a accent that Jon thinks is funny and now its starting to talk like him.

This may sound ignorant, Jon has had a few piercings, now I know piercing aren't a indication of being gay but... he use to have a eyebrow and bottom lip piercing, now he only has a tongue peircing, and he mentioned to me he wanted nipple peircing and considered getting penis piercing. He also likes his but squeezed and slapped during sex.

He's also his only sibling to not be married or have children. At one point he mentioned to me marrige and children but when I told him I was not interested in those things, he quickly changed his opinion, saying marriage and children we not necessary.

NOW before I can come up with any conclusions I would have to see how him and Chris behave together and I would have to ask him about past relationships, interest, and experiences. But my intuition tells me somethings up, just don't know what."

Discussion about sexual fluidity and its issues,Panda23000,ainbow,"Hello! A few days ago I wrote a similar post on other subreddit, but much shorter, where I have received interesting answers and now I am curious how the international community will react. 

As the title says the subject will be sexual fluidity. Before vote, comment, or downvote, please read the entire post. 

I consider that this is an inappropriate name for a phenomenon that happens anyway. I mean it is unrealistic to expect that 100% of LGBT+ members and cisgender heterosexuals do not discover during their lifetime that they have a different sexual orientation. This is completely normal because the whole phase with sexual orientation is a process of self-discovery. 
People who consider themselves comfortable over time using other label that suits them are totally valid, along with those who have managed to find themselves from the first. I think it's stupid that instead of normalizing this process, people over-label it to actually get nothing or maybe do more harm with this concept. 

My main problem with that concept is that it is expressed in a way that is too general. Not everyone's sexuality is fluid, it's just a few people's. This generally applies to bisexuals who at certain moments they may feel especially attracted to a certain gender, and then their attraction may oscillate towards another. I find it very sad that an entire concept had to appear to justify the totally valid experience of these people, given that they owe no one any explanation for such an intimate part of their identity. Biphobia sucks! 

Furthermore, I have noticed that the change in labeling is associated with sexual fluidity, which in some cases it's wrong and in other cases it's true. 

Firstly, we have gay people who were in heterosexual marriages and relationships and in some point of their life they come out as gay and they admit that they have never been attracted to their former partners and it was just heteronormativity. How could you go to those people who have wasted years of their lives and tell them: ""Sexuality is fluid. Try it again!"" 

Secondly, we have gay/heterosexual people who discovered that they are actually bisexuals. This fact proves that sexual fluidity applies to bisexuals. Like those who first identified themselves as bisexual; those who initially thought they were heterosexual or homosexual felt such an attraction that it seemed exclusive to a certain gender. I mean, it was not sexuality itself that changed, it was just their perception and what they knew about it. 

Thirdly, we have abrosexuals that I forgot to mention at first and to which the concept of sexual fluidity is fully applied and gay people who because of heteronormativity they thought they were bisexuals. 

On the other hand, I hate that sexual fluidity is used for to invalidate the experiences of homosexual, asexual and heterosexual people. It is very painful for me to see how these ""fixed"" sexualities are indirectly spoken of as concepts promoted by closed-minded people who do not want to experiment or who force themselves to be part of them, repressing their real feelings. 
Thank you for imposing on me how I feel, after years of struggling to accept myself as I am! 

Many people have complained on the internet about how they were judged because they do not accept their (non-existent) bisexuality, only because some even believe that sexuality is fluid for everyone. The case that disgusted me the most was when the man who raped a woman after her coming out as a lesbian, ""apologized"" saying that sexuality is fluid. 

After decades of studies and fighting for LGBT+ rights in which the ""born this way"" argument has been shown to be conclusive and correct, suddenly it's not like that anymore, only because of a study in which only a certain percentage of people reported a change in labeling, which, as I have shown before, does not always have to do with sexuality itself, but with its perception. In my opinion, ""born this way"" does not implies that being part of LGBT+ is wrong, in addition, it is a very good argument for those who still think that being in LGBT+ is a sin or a trend. 
A better way of putting it is that for those ( homophobes ) who deliberately want to discredit us, the whole phase of sexual fluidity can make it seem like a choice or indecision. 

Last but not least, I would like to clarify that I have nothing against those who are or consider that they are sexual fluidity. 
They know best how they feel, and no one can judge their personal experience, and if I have previously written something that would do that, I apologize in advance for my possible ignorance.
I am bothered by the erroneous way in which this concept spreads and its negative effects. 

Additions:
1. English is my second language, so I'm sorry if there are grammatical mistakes or if some expressions are strange.
2. By bisexuals I meant the whole spectrum and all their specific subcategorie. 
3. The idea of this post is that I understand that sexual fluidity defines the experience of many of you, but the fact that this has happened to you does not mean that it is for everyone. Sexual fluidity can only define a part of this community, and the fact that it is so widespread excludes others, which is very wrong for such a diverse community."

Resources for someone who feels alienated from many LGBT Spaces?,candyfloose,ainbow,"A little background on what I mean by this: Im a bisexual cis man (he/him) and Ive been out of the closet since I was 18. By all means Im proud to be queer. The problem is that I just dont feel at home with a lot of mainstream queer spaces and Im not sure how to deal with that. I dont ever want to come off as self-righteous or superior to spaces just because theyre not for me but I dunno.

Let me explain a bit more: I dont really identify as ultramasc or femme, but Im also not really androgynous either. Just sort of middle-of-the-road masculinity. I dont dress or look queer enough for people to immediately code me as queer (save for the times Ive dyed my hair pink). I respect drag scenes a lot but that couldnt be me. I dont identify with virtually all of mainstream Queer culture or at least the kinds that people always tokenize AS gay culture. I dont like things like Queer Eye or Love Simon that just read as assimilationist to me, and I ESPECIALLY fucking hate getting treated like a straight guy because I dont like Mamma Mia! or Dua Lipa or whatever the flavor-of-the-month obsession is. Everyone seems to be having fun with pride month and while Im glad that space exists, Im sick of seeing queer people suck up to commercial nonsense both online and at actual pride events.

My queer awakening wasnt solely based in edgy content (I love disco, *Moonlight*, *The Birdcage*, and David Bowie) but it was certainly a huge part of it. Industrial bands like COIL and Throbbing Gristle (and more recently, Black Dresses and Backxwash) had a really transgressive queer energy that I was drawn to. I cant stand fluffy queer writing (just not for me), all of the books I was/am drawn to are from people like Leslie Feinberg, James Baldwin, Marlon James, or Burroughs (who I know is a bad person, dont ask) who had really rough shit in their writing. I want to make it seem like I hunger for queer suffering but those kinds of things are just what Im drawn to. The problem is that I just dont really feel like that kind of stuff is represented at large by modern queer culture. Leather culture maybe, but I'm a little ways away from being able to fully get into that yet.

Im sorry if anyone feels offended by this or feels like Im talking down to them as basic. I just feel kind of alienated. Part of that might be the feeling I already get as a bi person where Im nudged just out of range of full queerness or whatever but I think this is bigger than that. Does anyone else feel the same way? If so, would you recommend any resources? This can be anything from media to subreddits to really anything that could be a good way to express this or at least come to terms with it."
Repost: why I do this,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good evening everyone dad checking in making sure you're ok and had a great day.

So im doing something I've never done and that's a complete repost.  I have posted in similar topics more than once but never a word for word repost.  Literally 30 people so far have asked me to do this for fear that people getting online later wouldn't see it. So here's a repost from this morning.


So last night someone asked me why I keep doing these post they said ""no one likes them or reads them"".  Now I know that's not true.  I have had too many of you tell me you liked them or that they've helped you.  Lets assume though that they were partially correct.  That the majority of people didn't like them.  I'd still post them.  What people don't realize is im not doing these posts to be popular or to recieve any kind of adulation.  If only one person ever got anything out of them and it helped that one person then its enough.  You see the lgbtqia+ community has people especially young people suffering everyday.  If my posts gives one child what they need to hang on and keep moving forward then I accomplished what I needed to.  These posts aren't designed to hype people up or tear people down.  They all are designed to help you learn how to cope.  Im a father IRL and im bi.  So many LGBTQ kids parents turn their backs on them because they think they choose to be this way.  I do these posts from the heart of a father who's own parents did the same.  I know what these kids are going through because I've been there.  So virtual dad is not a gimmick to me its from the heart.  I want to be an online parent to these hurting kids if it helps them.  So for anyone reading this wanting to know why im making these posts.  Its for the one child that decides to live another day because someone understood them and cared dammit.  My DM's are open and it promise I will respond depending on our time differences it may not be for a few hours if im asleep or at work but I will respond.

School,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey good evening its dad just checking in to see how your day was.  Hope it was the best day ever.

So before I get into my post i just have to share I saw the first ultra sound of my first grandchild today I was so happy you could see the head a leg and an arm real clear. I can't wait till march when its born.  Better start saving now so I can spoil them.  

For my kids tomorrow is the first day of school.  Now I know school starts at different times for everyone, but I wanted to go over some of the questions they had because im sure you do to.  As always if you have more questions than I cover feel free to message me and ask.  So first question was since im out to most of my friends and family is ok to let the teachers and other students know? Yes it is it you believe they will be supportive.  You do however need to be prepared.  The more people that know the greater the risk of bullying so be ready.  Next was how do I handle days where in amab but want to present feminine?  That's a tough because if all of your friends know you a male as soon as you come dressed feminine they're going to have questions.  My suggestion if you can talk to your friends before school starts.  Figure out who's supportive and who's not.  Next talk to principal and teachers make sure they're on board.  Then decide if you're going to use your current name or feminine name on those days.  Again the risk of being bullied is high be prepared.  Next I got asked how much lgbtqia stickers or clothes or jewelry etc. should I wear? If you're already out as much as you feel comfortable with.  Now the last question I was asked is what about dating?  First make sure the one you're interested in or that's interested in you is out, because lets face it if they aren't they will be then.  Second decide how public you want to be about it and make sure you both agree.  Third remember this has the potential to draw bullying as well.  Starting back to school is tough but its tougher being lgbtqia.  Have all your resources in place and good luck im proud of you all.  My DM's are open if you need me.

Couldnt get hard . What does this mean?,throwawayTS4444,ainbow,"I consider myself a straight male (39m) but I've always had an interest in hooking up with a MtF pre-op. I've always enjoyed watching TS porn and find many of the women to be absolutely beautiful. 

I got the opportunity to hook up with a TS Escort last night and it didn't go as expected. I actually knew her about 8 years ago so I felt somewhat comfortable working with her. I was attracted to her from the years before but not as much when I saw her last night. I was still ready and into it though. 

She came over after the agreed upon price and I poured her a drink. I don't drink myself so I just had a soda water. After some talking we started to make out. She takes out her cock and she is already hard. I begin to suck it. This is the fist cock I've sucked and she corrected me on the form. I didn't really enjoy the experience - it felt really strange in my mouth and although I liked giving her pleasure I wasn't that into it. 

We moved to the bedroom where I sucked her off some more. She brought out some lube and asked me if I wanted to get fucked and I said yes. She grabbed a pillow and put it under me as she slowly entered. This is the first time I've been penetrated but I do use a prostate toy on myself which I use while jerking off sometimes. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. She fucked me doggy for a bit which seemed to work a bit better. Somewhat painful. Wasn't a huge turn on but was OK.

I couldn't get hard the entire time. She tried sucking me off and it didn't work. I wasn't hard while she was fucking me either. 

I sucked her off until she came in my mouth. I tasted her semen a bit but didn't like it so spit it on my chest.

I guess I'm just wondering if I'm not actually attracted to TS because I couldn't get hard? Was it maybe the person? Does this happen a lot for first-timers? Is it because I'm not gay or bisexual that I didn't get hard? 

I'm glad I tried it. I don't feel disgusted or shamed about my experience."

The Inhumane and Brutal Death of Stephen Smith,SleuthBee,ainbow,"Stephen Smith was a handsome, vibrant and intelligent young man seeking a career in medicine.  Always upfront about his sexuality, it was rumored that he began a relationship with the son of a wealthy and powerful family.  The case was tainted then mysteriously swept under the rug.

While a death equally as brutal as Matthew Shepards', Stephen's mother Sandy, didn't have the means or support necessary to bring his case the attention it deserved.  Now, finally after 6 years, and the death of one of the suspects, his case gained enough attention to finally open an investigation.  But is it enough to make them see it through?  Will you please take a few moments to learn about [Stephen's murder?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurdaughFamilyMurders/comments/owdrom/the_inhuman_and_brutal_death_of_stephen_smith/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Am I actually masturbating?,throwwayacc000032,ainbow,"So when I was 7 or so I was on a couch in a prone position and discovered that slipping my left hand between the couch and my penis and squeezing it rhythmically felt really good. 

I usually did this when viewing pictures of attractive muscular men (always clothed or at least with pants on), though sometimes I'd just use my imagination. 

The thing is, I'm 20 now and I still get off exactly the same way. I've known about the pump version of masturbation for a couple years but have only tried it for a short time a couple times with no success.

I don't really watch naked men on porn videos to get erections and masturbate (if that's what I'm doing), instead I look up pics of big muscular men doing normal stuff.

While doing the prone hand thing, I've never ejaculated in my life. I sometimes get an oily transparent liquid (I assume it's precum) and I did see a few drops of a white substance a few months ago, though there was barely any.

Is what I do to get off actually considered masturbation? Does it have anything to do with not ejaculating and is the fact that I don't watch actual porn relevant to any of this?"

Validation,bi_dad48,ainbow,"They good morning everyone its dad checking in just making sure you're doing ok.

I just want to remind you today you are valid.  Everything about you is valid.  Your gender your sexuality your style your feelings etc. Everything is valid.

They don't know the pain the dysphoria the mental anguish you have gone through to get where you are, therefore they are in no position to be able to invalidate you.

"I was talking to a friend about Rowling and just realised that in her books, almost all Slytherins are queer-coded",Its_Sasha,ainbow,"Slytherins are a stand-in for the LGBT community in the books, and them being evil represents JKRs view of them. Rita Skeeter, the trans-coded reporter was Slytherin. Albus, who she retconned as gay was Slytherin. 

It makes a lot of sense and makes me hate the series that was my escape as a child even more."
Can the LGBT make a senate?,Ipluggucci,ainbow,"You ever feel that the LGBT is TOO INCLUSIVE to anything to the point that any crazy person can come in and make up new terminology that everyone has to accept. 

I was on youtube and saw this guy was a gender less alien with created random ass pronouns and all. I feel that there has to be some type of barrier to limit the attention seeking trolls and trojan horses. 

I feel that what makes it hard for LGBT acceptance to get where it needs to be, is literally any crazy person can come inside and make up shit and its law. So trojan horse trolls can come inside the mix and be a portrayal of the whole community. This is how propaganda spreads Fox News finds the worst and paints it as all there has to be a point where we say nah we do not claim this idea or terminology. 

Like the trans community should draw some type of line to prevent predators from taking advantage of the freedoms they fought for. No dude can wake up one day and be Nick and go inside a womens locker room and be Nancy for 5 minutes these creepy ass dudes are fucking shit up for everybody. 

Its to the point where most people that do try to understand the shit look in and theres a whole expanded Marvel Universe with 292939 Characters they have to learn where they say ok nvm"

Acceptance,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey family a very tired worn out dad checking in seeing how everyone is.  I hope its not hot where you are like it is here in Georgia whew.

So i was talking to the kids last night and my niece who's 14 asked me how she can accept herself more as lesbian.  Honestly it get me to thinking and I've seen lots of post about ""how can I accept myself as bisexual, gay, lesbian, trans, asexual etc.  A lot of you have grown up in homes or areas where being lgbtqia+ is frowned upon.  Now you find yourself part of that group and you don't know how to accept it.  Others if you have always thought you were heterosexuals only to find out you're not and don't know how to accept it.  First you have to realize what you're feeling is natural its how you were born.  Nothing turned you this way it cannot be changed.  Next you have to accept that at some point you want to be comfortable enough to come out and tell others.  Next accept that its not a bad thing its ok to be different.  Now I know there's countries where you can't be open about but for those who can this is how you accept it.  Now accepting doesn't mean everything will go ok for everyone.  Just being honest here.  Some will have no problems others will have to wait until they're adults on their own to come out.  I do believe you have to accept yourself before you can come out.  However just because you've accepted yourself doesn't mean you have to do it right away.  Acceptance just means youre ready when the time is right.  Its going to take time for some of you that's ok there's no need to rush it go at your own pace.  My DM's are open if anyone needs to talk

Questioning and Struggling,magicalmic_mimi,ainbow,"Im a 30 y/o cis female married to an amazing straight cis male that I'm very happy and in love with. I recently started questioning whether I may be Bi or Pan, which he's been very supportive of. I don't even know what triggered the lucidity on the subject and it's really thrown me for a loop. I've always had a horrible guilt complex (most likely related to my very religious upbringing - Catholic AND Lutheran) and the guilt and anxiety have come out full force while trying to process this. I recently started having sexual fantasies about woman which has occurred a few times in the past, but only while drinking. I've also made out with several of my female friends over the years, but was never one to initiate or seek it out, just agreeable to kissing and generally enjoyed it. Lately, I've found myself noticing woman more and more and it makes me really nervous/embarrassed. I honestly feel like a teenage boy during puberty because I'm like constantly distracted by woman or aroused and totally trying to hide it or push the thoughts out of my mind. I'm frustrated with myself for being so unkind to myself and allowing my anxiety to make me believe any part of this is wrong. Ever since leaving my conservative home town to go to college after high school, I have always been drawn to and felt like I belonged with the LGBTQ+ community and met even more friends in the community after joining a rugby team. My husband has told me so many times he trusts me and wants me to explore, but I still find myself feeling like it would be cheating, even though we have talked through clear boundaries and are on the same page. I'm also EXTREMELY sexually frustrated, but equally terrified about how to even begin this exploration journey or how to meet women. I feel like I have so many questions and Google can only tell you so much about the human experience. I've only ever kissed a woman and nothing past that. Until recently, I pretty much refused to watch anything with female nudity because it made me so uncomfortable, which seems to make a lot more sense now, along with some other repressive behaviors I'm starting to notice in myself. Anyway, looking for advice on how to work through this, tips for getting out there/meeting people, being upfront with my situation with potential dates/partners, etc. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to read this novel of a post!

Slowly becoming me. But who or what am I?,PaxV,ainbow,"Hi, I'm 46, I'm not really working toward the nomenclature, as I find it complicated. 

I recently posted a story in r/LGBT, but removed it pretty fast... It was more personal then this one, and this one could vanish as well, which is not a sign of mistrust, but more a problem with me trying to cope with coming out online. I had significant bad experiences with acceptance as I wrote in my deleted piece. I'll skip that for now. 

I am male, as far as biology goes.
I've always questioned my gender, but always refused to either embrace it or change. I have had a wish for a different body, but after a lot of soulsearching I do not think a female one would be me either. 

I'm married with my wife, but had boy- and girlfriends before. Many of my relations were non sexual, romantic only, and if sexual most often, if not always, initiated by my partners at the time. This sometimes works out and sometimes doesn't often reflecting my feelings how involved I am in a relation, and thus partner at a certain time. The sex of my partners really doesn't matter, though male partners tend to have more problems if you are not sexually into a relationship. One night stands if happening at all with sex is mostly masturbation, not penetrating sex. 

I have been years alone as well and not looking for friends, relationships or sexual contact, feeling comfortable not seeking any relation. This was the better part of my highschool and university years

I do not like sex and even though I can be aroused and occasionally have my urges, I still find intercourse unpleasant. I love hugs, cuddles, kisses, being with my/a partner, I do not like penetration, being penetrated, French kisses, or other licking and sucking. As witten before in my now deleted post it tends to be quite disgusting to me. 

I love my wife and try (and have tried) to be as forthcoming (sexually) as I can, past my own limits. I have tried to perform as well as possible in bed if she wants to, but this can be very limited and sometimes frustrating to both. She knows this is not her fault, and I do not consider me being myself to be at fault or faulty in any way. 

Like I said I'm not very sexually active, but I do have 2 kids, both conceived 'normally', 1st one was relatively easy, as my wife and I really wanted a child, and when we committed to conceiving, my wife was pregnant within a month, but the 2nd one came very close to IVF due to me not 'performing well', mostly because I was very hesitant to get another kid, not because I was against a second kid, but I feared the strain of raising a second kid. This mental thing posed an incredible complicated problem. My wife felt my daughter needed a brother or sister. I communicated my problems and we discussed it, we talked about my feelings and the backlash on my already hopeless sexual performance, it made me very uncomfortable trying. In the end the whole series of attempts became a lengthy ordeal. It took in excess of 14 months, and for me way to many tries, we were well into an IVF traject at the time, with planned times for the hormone shots and seed and egg harvest..., it also showed there is nothing physically wrong with my reproductive system. 

In the end the wish for a second kid ended up an awful experience and it left me completely avoiding romantic and sexual interaction with my wife for quite sometime (years) after the birth of my 2nd daughter. I became really frigid. 
It was weird sometimes, it felt like we lived 2 unrelated lives at times in the same household sometimes. I still cared for my wife and she for me, but there was a lot of emotional distance. We slept in the same bed, but I felt disconnected. We did raise both kids with me as a househusband and my wife working fulltime.

We are now 7 years since my second was born, and I'm slowly noticing the wish to be romantic with my wife return... I'm still happy to be with her and I am happy once more to live by her side. The fact she didn't want to acknowledge my feelings towards getting a second child is mostly forgotten, and I love my 2nd daughter as much as my 1st.

My wife knows she forced pushing for our second kid. I do not like how this came to be but I'm happy with my daughter, and yes, it is often too much too cope with. I still love being with my wife.

I am now really exploring information on what I am or not am and where to place my feelings and emotions. In my teens and 20s I was active in the LGBT scene, but when I moved from my university city it faded, but a lot of questions remained. A lot has changed in the last 15 to 20 years. 

My wife knows I had male and female loves and partners. So does my mother. I never opened up about my gender in the city I live in now. I have few friends. If asked I'll answer I'm bi. But I cannot explain further.  

I have a lot trouble opening up to someone in most cases and am pretty shy and evasive so getting to opening up is a problem as well.

 The search regarding my gender identity, my romantic affiliation or sexuality feels like it's out of the ordinary. I know some gay people but they are acquaintances, not friends... And I feel hesitant coming out to them. I have had a variety of negative experiences being honest  before... 

I'm facing a new thing now, 

 My eldest daughter has expressed feelings on more then one occasion stating she doesn't feel girl nor boy, but favors being seen as girl. 
 
I feel I should look into my gender more and get to grasp my place in the world more, also to answer my daughters questions in the coming years, as I expect them to surface in a couple of years. Not fully understanding who I am myself will not be very helpful. 

So... What to do now? Who should I talk to? Where should I start? I have no clue. 

A lot of questions remain vague, but I'm going to go on.

I'm not gay at all, but I wanted to try it because I feel like a bitch like I deserve it, becauze all the bullying I had received in recent years. I didn't like it at all, it was disgusting, I have taste of his penis in my mouth forever. I wanted to improve my life, now I cant because I'm bitch, I don't deserve it. Whenever I improve in some area, I will remember that I was a bitch, sucking an older man. That act was so degrading, he was a little bit agressive. I'm the best and the named act ruins my image of being the best, now I want to be ordinary dude. I'm not the greatest living human anymore(I say human figuratively Im superior to humans that how I feel).

Be bold,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good evening my family hope you've had a great day. I want to remind you that even though you may not always think so you are very loved.


Have you ever had a bad break up or divorce you know the kind where you were really in love but they broke your heart and that was it im done dating.  Did you ever present yourself as your true gender only to be told you don't pass good enough.  Have you ever came out to someone only to be invalidated and vow never to tell anyone else.  I could go on but I think you got the picture.  Whether your lgbtqia+ or not we've all had heartbreak of some kind and it makes you never want to put yourself out there again.   Well im telling you to put yourself out there.  You have to be bold.  Ok so they broke up with me and it hurts like hell but im gonna dust myself off and keep trying until I find love.  Ok so they say I didn't pass well im gonna work on my look until they don't realize im trans.  Ok so i can out but your opinion doesn't invalidate me I know who I am and im proud and you can't take that away.  We need to be bold and confident in who we are.  We are valid dammit.  We are free to love whom we want.  And we are free to present as our gender despite your opinion.  We need to be bold and claim our rights.  We need to be bold even if were bullied even if were laughed at even if no  one cares.  We need to be bold because our leaders in the past got us the rights we have now and we need to be bold to keep them and go for more.  I don't know why people think we're all meek and mild and wont cause a fuss because we're bold and ready to stand up for what we deserve.  We're valid and we will be heard.  We're not going away.

Confronting my sexuality.,These_Cucumber_1348,ainbow,"Hey yall, 15 year old dude here. For most of my life Ive thought I was straight but now Im starting to question it. For about the past year (and a few times before that) Ive been finding myself attracted to men, trans women, trans men, and non-binary people. Ive been putting it off as a phase that will pass in time but, I dont know anymore. I recently had a experience with a trans dude and its made me really question myself because I really enjoyed it.

Be the change,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey its dad hope you're doing great today.  You are so special and so loved never forget it.

So after my post yesterday I had people asking what they could do to show courage.  Just be willing to be yourself.  Be the change people want to make.  Wear your make up the way you like not then way society has always done it.  Create your own clothing style.  Mix and match what makes you happy.  Cut or color your hair the way you want.  Break gender rules with clothing be unique be you.  Especially if you're out already don't be afraid to tell others your sexuality or gender.  There's no wrong way to be you.  Reveloutions start by people being willing to no longer follow the norms.  People who are willing to set new trends and styles.  People willing to be unique despite society.  We have to be willing to fight to make lgbtqia more normal than it is today.  We have to assume no one else is going to do it but ourselves.  Become the individual that makes the change and break barriers.  Become the individual who demands equality.  Become the change people need.  My DM's are open lets talk if you need to.

Love you

Doubts about orientation,000002thrwaway20000_,ainbow,"Hello,

I've been thinking about this for a long time, hopefully you guys can help me out.

For as long as I can remember, I've been interested in men. Back in grade school, I recall thinking a lot about a classmate of mine without knowing why. I would often find myself making excuses to talk to him, you know how it goes.

After a few months, the same thing happened with another boy. We didn't really click, though, and thinking back I did come off a bit weird (nothing inappropriate in that sense, I just didn't know how to go about these things back then).

This pattern basically repeated itself during middle and high school, with all the ""crushes"" except for one being male. I'm still very much an introvert, but I'm actually on good terms with most of them now, not that I know them super well, but still.

While all this was happening, I discovered that looking at pictures online of good looking men gave me a hard on. I've always masturbated (maybe I should have made another post for this) by laying prone and putting pressure on my dick with my thumb and body weight. The thing is, none of the pics actually involved nudity. I would often look at bearish body types (arm wrestlers, strongmen), but not bodybuilders, for example. I've never had this happen with women.

I guess I should mention that I've never actually ejaculated with this method (I hit puberty a few years ago). Ive tried the traditional way recently and I stopped too early. When I masturbate (not sure I can call it that), I just do the pressure thing until I get tired of looking at the pics and stop. I do have orgasms occasionally.

I discovered porn at a very late age compared to most people these days, and since then I've only watched it a couple times, both gay and straight. While I do get turned on by the men, I don't know if it's because of the actual sex or how good their bodies look. 

I haven't actually done anything with a guy or a girl, I'm behind in that aspect. While I think there's a good chance I'm gay, I suppose the whole falling for dudes thing could be simply wanting to be friends with them and my brain is misinterpreting it as sexual attraction? Maybe I like looking at the pics because I want that kind of physique for myself?

I'm in a very accepting environment, so I'm not really worried about this. I'm just curious. Pointers?"

Announcement: Subreddit Updates!,Nightwielder_,ainbow,"Hello Everyone,

You may have notices some small changes to r/ainbow recently, such as the addition of a server banner. We will make a mobile version of the banner as the current one does not scale well to smaller screens. In addition, we've updated our server icon to match our more modern discord icon. 

We've also made updates to the rules. The first is the addition of rule 6, which now prohibits chain post. Examples of chain  posts include &lt;identity&gt; is valid pass it on"" or ""reblog if you  are against hate crimes."" Posts like these add little to our community and often rely on guilt to glean clout.

Second, we've decided to explicitly lay out our reddit crowdfunding policy in rule 7.  Asking for donations or linking to crowdfunding websites is not permitted, as there is no good way to differentiate scammers  and people who genuinely need support on a forum like this.

Finally, we've reworded rules 2, 3, 6, and 7 for clarity."

Sometimes courage comes in doing what's right for you.  This life we lead as lgbtqia+ takes courage.  We are going against the norms of society. We are loving who we love despite what people think.  Even if you're still in the closet your courageous.  You know eventually you will come out but until then it takes courage to hide a live life in front of those who may not accept you.  It takes courage to tell those you work with your sexuality or gender.  It takes courage to tell your friends or people at school.  It takes courage to fly your flag or wear the colors.  It takes courage knowing you could be bullied or beaten up.  It takes courage to be you.  You have that courage inside you don't let anyone tell you different.  You have the courage to be you.  To fight for your rights.  To fight to love who you love. To fight to dress how you want.  To fight to be accepted.  It is through your courage others find their courage.  It spark's the fire in them to come alive and say if they can why can't I.  It only takes a spark to start a fire that consumes everything around it.  It takes on person with courage to start a revolution.  Be that person be the spark that makes change.  My DM's are open to anyone.

Love always

Social media and Activism thoughts.,abneraragont,ainbow,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share some thoughts and experiences. Im an activist in Mxico, i became one by accident when I created an association that defends LGBT+ rights at my university. It has opened my mind so much, and I feel happy for everything Ive learned and everyone Ive met so far, but at the same time I feel like I just wanna quit social media completely.

Before this I was in a depressive state cause I broke up with my boyfriend (who I was with for almost 4 years) at this time I erased all my social media and went to therapy, so it was a surprise how much people supported me and the fight for LGBT+ rights, and I fought a great man who is now my boyfriend, but lately Ive been feeling like social media its too much.

People really expect everyone to be perfect or theres too much going on. Ive been considering erasing my accounts (except Reddit) again.

Its just a thought Ive had about how society lately regarding social media, because it can be helpful and at the same time harmful. 

Ive been feeling a little bit sad of how people just constantly fight (specially on Facebook), how much hate there is and as an activist how much people can demand. So thinking about a simple life with just work, my family and my boyfriend seem enough for me but at the same time Im afraid to let down people by not continuing to fight for LGBT+ rights, while I enjoy sharing my personality and fight, I feel like it may drain my energy.

What do you guys think about all of this?

Thanks and Im sorry about the long text, I felt like sharing this thoughts."

"Can you debunk the claims on mygenes.co and ""my genes made me do it"" please? Has anyone already debunked them?",FunZestyclose4002,ainbow,"I found this website, which at first I thought is gay friendly, but turns out is the complete opposite: [https://www.mygenes.co.nz/myths.html](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/myths.html)

&gt;[Gay relationships are as stable and long-lasting as those of heterosexuals](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/myths.html#collapseOne2)  
&gt;  
&gt;Gay relationships last 4.5 years (+ or -2) for both gays and lesbians, whereas in the divorce-prone US a heterosexual couple has nearly an even chance of reaching their silver wedding anniversary (25y).   
&gt;  
&gt;[Gay orientation cannot be changed](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/myths.html#collapseOne10)  
&gt;  
&gt;Neutral academic surveys show there is substantial change. About half of the gay/bisexual population (in a non-therapeutic environment) moves towards heterosexuality over a lifetime. About 3% of the present heterosexual population once firmly believed themselves to be gay or bisexual. Gay people's sexual orientation is not set in concrete.   
&gt;  
&gt;[Gay psychological problems are a result of society's discrimination and rejection](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/myths.html#collapseOne5)  
&gt;  
&gt;Very little evidence has been found for this. Whether in tolerant and accepting environments or in intolerant ones, the incidence and type of psychological problems remain about the same.   
&gt;  
&gt;[Gay teens need special support in schools](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/myths.html#collapseOne11)  
&gt;  
&gt;In the West today, 98% of todays teens who believe they are gay at 16 will believe they are heterosexual one year later. It is irresponsible to offer gay affirmative counselling to teens on the grounds that their orientation is intrinsic and fixed.   
&gt;  
&gt;[Therapy producing change in sexual orientation is damaging](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/myths.html#collapseOne12)  
&gt;  
&gt;The best longitudinal study (backed up by many others) shows most people change to some extent - from slightly to 100%. Positive and negative effects are typical of outcomes for most other therapies. Re-orientation therapies also decrease depression, and substance abuse.   
&gt;  
&gt;[Private sexual acts do not affect society](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/myths.html#collapseOne13)  
&gt;  
&gt;Gay sex is medically risky. Surveys put the number of practising gay/bisexual men who are married at about 15%, putting wives at risk. Sexual activity (gay or straight) outside long-term, faithful relationships impacts society in numerous costly ways. 

They promote conversion therapy for gay people, and indirectly claim being gay is for losers: [https://www.mygenes.co.nz/rams.html](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/rams.html)

&gt;In this species homosexual expression in rams is for the losers - rather reminiscent of ""situational homosexuality"" among men 

In the ""scientific reviews of the controversies"", they share studies that gay people can not be mentally healthy, even if they are in accepting environments, and can not have long lasting relationships: [https://www.mygenes.co.nz/survival.pdf](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/survival.pdf)

It's really important for these claims to be debunked because they are still out there, and many read them. I've heard the books ""my genes made me do it"" have been translated to russian, and shared with the people of russia and africa. This increases hostility towards gay people. 

These are the anti-gay books I'm referring to: [https://www.mygenes.co.nz/mgmmdi\_pdfs/2020\_MGMMDI\_full.pdf](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/mgmmdi_pdfs/2020_MGMMDI_full.pdf)

Book summary: [https://www.mygenes.co.nz/summary.html](https://www.mygenes.co.nz/summary.html)

Take a look at the reviews: 

&gt;Awesome. A thorough review of scientific research about the causes of gay attraction and the possibility for change!    
&gt;  
&gt;In the world we live today where aberrant sexual orientation is being pushed to be the norm, this book is a brave and much needed attempt in exposing the pseudoscience of gay-related acts in particular.  
&gt;  
&gt;I recommend this book for people who have an open mind, want a different perspective (different then what the MSM often perpetuates) on this issue and are tolerant (ya, I said tolerant) of the views of others. I find it ironic that the same people who constantly preach ""tolerance"" are often so intolerant of people who disagree with them. I felt the book was well written.   
&gt;  
&gt;Probably the best way to understand the opposition to this book is to read the one-star reviews. A cautious reader will note that only one single person (as of this date) actually put any sort of reference to back up their claim. You will also note that they only tried to refute one small piece of the puzzle. The dozens of other foundational evidences remain solid. The remainder of the one-star reviews make claims based upon emotionalism, which is indicative of the quality of the argument.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In short, the authors keep revising and updating things as science advances our understanding of human behavior. The opponenets lob insults. Which side do you think is right? 

They think their anti-gay side is right because the people who are not anti-gay can not debunk their claims, and all they can do is use ""insults"". This isn't good. This is really, really bad. Please help."

Advice for coming out to parents needed,Hyphen1-2,ainbow,"I (17M) want to come out so so bad. I am so exhausted in the closet waiting and wondering when the right time will be. I dont want to regret not coming out when the reaction may not be that bad. I truly have no idea how my parents will react. I know that I probably wont be kicked out or ignored but I do feel like if my parents could chose if I were straight or gay, they would choose for me to be straight. But that doesnt make they still wont accept me for being gay even though they may want me to be straight. Growing up, I felt so alone and my parents never really said anything good nor bad about the lgbtq community. They would watch shows and movies with lgbt representation but sometimes they skip forward if they are having a passionate kiss or something. Giving the benefit of the doubt, maybe they just arent used to it or it makes them a little uncomfortable. I mean, my mom barely even found out what the rainbow flag stood for back in November when a neighbor hung theirs up. I just feel the way they both grew up in Catholic and Hispanic households they never really saw it around them. 

But now that Im growing up, Im realizing that a lot of the people that Ive known are gay. For example, my dads cousin is gay and has a boyfriend. My dad and my grandparents seem to welcome him and treat him normally any time we see him. However, one time my dad was talking about how his cousin and his boyfriend got COVID, the first time he said the story he said that his cousin and his partner got COVID but then when he said the story again he just said his cousin and his friend I dont know if thats a red flag. 

But regardless, growing up no one ever really told me being gay was ok, but I had an older second cousin who I rarely see who when I would see, he would ask me, So hows school? Is there any girl youve got youre eye on? Even a guy, thats completely fine too and he would ask me that everytime just to check in. The thing is, he would only ask me about the guy thing and not my brothers. I feel like maybe he knew and wanted me to be more comfortable. Come to find out, about two years ago, he came out as gay himself. He never exclusively told anyone, but word got around ablando no one treated him differently. However, theres still people that dont know because it never really got talked about and he never came out to them and my parents may be part of that group. 

Recently, one of the most surprising ones that I found out was my granduncle? (If thats what theyre called, my grandmas brother) is gay. But hes not open about it. I dont know if someone outed him, but my aunts friend said she saw him at a gay club many years ago. I was with that aunts kids (my cousins) and they were like did you know uncle John is gay?Part of me is surprised though because he grew up in Mexico and lived there as a kid until they moved to the United States. I assume he grew up Catholic as well and just growing up Catholic, with a very conservative Hispanic mother, and almost half a century ago it mustve been so hard to be gay (if he even knew who he was then.) After I found out this information, all the pieces started coming together, he would always bring this guy to family events and just say they were friends. I really have no idea if my grandmother knows though. If she does, she has him over to her house often and shares her grandchildren with him to make memories with and laughs with him which makes me feel if she loves him, shell love me still too. As for my mom, I dont think she knows but she loves her uncle so so much and if she knows hes gay, that must be good for me? 

Another time my parents were exposed to lgbt people were my sisters friends/coworkers. My sister got really close with these friends and when my sister would come home for dinner, she would talk about her life and her friends and some of her best friends she just made recently were a lesbian couple. They are the sweetest people ever. My dad says that one of the girls is literally so sweet and the nicest girl. My parents always say say hi to Courtney for me or stuff like that. The couple actually just got engaged recently and posted pictures on social media. When I showed my mom the pictures, she said aww thats cute! Its just a little different. She didnt seem upset or anything but maybe she just grew up not used to it. My mom said that they can come over for dinner anytime.

Recently, my older brother became really good friends with this girl and started bringing her to our house. My parents began speculating if there was something between the two as they were giggling together all the time, hanging out all the time, but when they asked my brother said shes into girls. Since then they havent minded her at our house nor said anything about her.

Im just worried and confused because just because they will still love and accept someone else they arent that close to, it doesnt mean that theyll be happy their own son is gay. All my life Ive had only female friends as its easier, a flamboyant and exaggerative facial expressions and hand gestures, the way I talk, my parents have asked (all at different times) why I do that and that its a little awkward. I mean just because I do that stuff doesnt mean Im gay, but they are gay stereotypes and Im know they arent stupid. I feel like my siblings know deep down that I am but I think theyre waiting for me to say it so they can accept me. The other day I had my phone in the open and I was opening my camera roll and there was a saved picture of a guy i thought was cute and my brother asked what It was and I had to make up a lame excuse and I mean it seemed to work because the subject changed. However that exact same day, it was later in the night and I was showing pictures from my cousins graduation and I accidentally scrolled one photo too far and it was a sexually suggestive picture of two guys. There was no nudity or anything, but after a second of not realizing it, I quickly swiped the photo back and tried changing the subject. My mom asked what was that? And smiled at me. Not only had my mom just seen a sexually suggestive picture on my phone, but it was a gay sexually suggestive photo. My heart dropped and I literally thought it was about to be time for me to come out. I just like chuckled it off and said it was nothing and tried changing the subject back to the graduation. I dont know if she really saw what it was or just like something random but I literally almost shit myself if Im being honest. 

But honestly, I just really want to come out and I think everyone else will accept me, friends, aunts, uncles, probably grandparents, Im just scared of losing the people I love the most and not having their acceptance. I think deep down they will accept me, its just whether they will have a hard or long time doing that. I want to come out already. I dont want to get older and come out and everything be okay and regret not coming out sooner. I want to come out before I go to college and Im about to start my senior year of high school. I want to tell my bestfriend, but I know once I say what I am, its set in stone and theres no more saying Im straight. I think whats stopping me is my parents. I already set up dinner with my friend so I can just talk one on one with her and tell her. I know she 100% will accept me. I just chicken out everytime before Im about to tel her and I hope I dont this time. If you have any advice for me about any of this at all, I would love it and be so so thankful for it &lt;3."

I love when karma comes back and bites someone in the ass quickly.  Sometimes you're not around to see it but I was.  So today im eating lunch at a local diner.  This family comes in right behind me and sits near where I am.  The mother tells her son who I would learn is 14 to tell his dad what he had told her.  The boy with tears in his eyes pleaded with her to wait until they got home but no she insisted he tell.  So with tears in his eyes he tells his dad who looks like a professional wrestler that he was gay.  His dad looked him in the eyes and said oh cool is that all it was.  Mom was furious she said is that all are you going to tell me your going to let this f***** live in our home.  Dad never batted an eye but simply yes he can live in my home as long as he needs you on the other hand have till Saturday to find somewhere to go.  Needles to say she left right then.  I love seeing dads step up and be the accepting parent would be nice when both are.  The son assumed because of how rough his dad looked he must be homophobic turned out his mom was.  Guys we can never judge how someone as going to react but we should never put ourselves at risk by coming out before were ready.  I don't know if this son came out to his mom or she figured it out but it was clear he wasn't ready.  Im glad it turned out ok for him in the end.  It took a great amount of courage even though he was scared to do it im proud of this young man.  The mother got what she deserved i have a feeling him and her have argued over issues like this before and this was the last straw.  I hope everything continues to work out for dad and son.

Hello everyone I want to discuss something serious,sunil677,ainbow,"Hello , im new here. Im a 23 years old identified as male by society. In my childhood some time i used my moom makeup just for fun only. But unfortunately I don't know it may put me into trouble in future. When i grew up, i noticed that my adult video preference is not like the straight guy. I found myself more comfortable when i watch transexual adult videos. Please everyone , don't mind if i use any offensive language during my conversation. I have no intention to effect any particular community. So, i will continue with my problems.when i watch adult video, i like to wear female clothes or makeup like them. But it only happen when i got sexually excited. Otherwise i feel totally as a straight. I laso want to add my new activities by which you can identify my main issues. After staying a long time in home in this lockdown, i start act like a gay people but i never want to do it. When i got sexually excited i can't control myself without doing those things. Sometimes i think may be i have a gender dysphoria or im actually a trans person stuck into a nale body. Can anyone please help me by telling that is it a any sign of transgender or i just do those things to give me pleasure. Please don't ignore this message."
"How do I know if I'm gay, I'm feeling really lost atm",itssmeagain,ainbow,"Lately I've been really questioning my sexuality. I'm 26f and I've never had a serious relationship. I've only had sex when drunk (with men) and when I'm sober I feel like I don't want to even touch men. I've dated, but I never really got that into anyone. I was watching a movie with my friends and they all were telling how sexy the guys were and my first thought was that the woman was so beautiful and I just blurted it out. Then I felt like I had to say something about the men in that movie so I did.

I've never really had a crush on any man. I have drunkenly admitted that I had a crush on one girl, but I'm not sure if I did. I'm just so confused. I've had some drunken experiences with women and it always felt way more comfortable than with men. I've always identified very strongly with lesbian characters in movies, books etc.

The problem is I'm afraid of men. So I don't know if I'm just trying to convince myself that I'm a lesbian and not deal with my fear or I feel that uncomfortable around men because I'm forcing myself to be straight. I'm in therapy trying to work this all out. But it feels like a huge step to come out to everyone if I end up not being gay. I feel really lost right now and don't know what to do"

I feel like if I came out to my friends they would treat or view me differently. I dont want them to think I have a crush on them, because I really do have a crush on one of my friends who I am 99% sure is straight. I dont really see or talk to him in real life that much, I only really talk to him through instagram and tiktok. So i feel like admitting that I like him or that Im bi will make him feel weird and make him not want to talk to me anymore. I dont know why but I feel like being gay is gross and weird, like Im attracted to guys and stuff but theres always a voice in the back of my head telling me that its unnatural and shouldnt exist. I dont know. I just feel like I wont be able to come out/accept myself anytime soon."

Never be ashamed,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hi family its dad checking in making sure everyone is ok.  I hope you had a great day and know just how special you are.

You should never apologize for who you are.  Yes you read that right.  You were born this great and wonderful person and your gender or sexuality should not determine your worth.  The world wants us to believe that because we are lgbtqia+  that we should be ashamed of who we are.  That we are less than people who are hetero.  That who we love doesn't matter.  Well the last time I checked the world doesn't pay my bills so they have no say. I am proud to bisexual im proud to be lgbtqia+ im proud of the men I have loved as well as the women and nonbinary etc. You should be proud to.  For so long the world our parents our friends have tried to make us feel ashamed for being lgbtqia.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Being gay or lesbian or bi or trans etc are all natural.  We are no different than hetero people. Therefore there's no shame.  We need to stand up for ourselves and say no more will I feel shame for my gender or sexuality no more will I feel shame for my gender and no more will I feel shame for who I love.  Its your life you get to be with who you love not with who they tell you to love.  Don't let shame keep you from following your heart go get the one you love.  My DM's are open if you need to talk.

How do you know?,strawberry_baby_4evs,ainbow,"This is one of the biggest questions I (26F) face as a pansexual female. How do I know I'm pansexual?

I should add here that I usually identify as bisexual. My reason for bisexuality, though, is a pansexual mindset of ""We're all human beings, men and women aren't different enough for me to feel romantic towards one and not the other.""

The thing is, a friend of mine (23F), who identifies as lesbian - earlier this evening, she texts me about this boy she thinks she has a crush on. And I just talk as a listener - she just wanted to tell someone. And all the time I'm thinking ""A boy?"" Does that mean she's not a lesbian, or that she has romantic feelings towards both sexes but sexual feelings towards just women or girls? I feel odd about asking her myself, because I don't want to make things weird.

It's like, after that, how do you know you're a lesbian, or bi, or straight? I know this is an odd post, and if it gets removed because I unknowingly broke a rule, I'll understand. But I want to hear from you guys - how do you know your sexuality? How did you figure it out as part of your identity? Is there any advice you have on finding your sexual/romantic identity?"

Reach for your dreams,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey good evening my lovely family hope you had a great freaking day.  You are so loved and so special I hope you realize that.

You know I was thinking today.  Gender roles have really warped our society.  A lot of people think we are limited by our gender and sexuality unless your a heterosexual male then you're at the top of the food chain.  There's stereotypes that suggest gay men for instance are to effeminate for sports tell that to Carl Nassib or Tom Daley.  Its thought that same sex couples or LGBTQ couples of any kind can't raise children because you need a mother and a father.  No to have children you sperm and an egg after that anyone with love can raise a child. This doesn't just apply to LGBTQ for years it was taught men work and women stay home raise the kids and cook.  There's a lot about gender and sexuality stereotypes that are wrong.  I work as a funeral director a predominantly male dominant field.  Primarily for 2 reasons 1.  They thought women were too emotional and 2. They aren't physically strong enough all of which is wrong and its slowly changing finally.   Gender roles and a persons sexuality no longer limits them to what they can do.  I played football all the way through high school liking guys didn't make me to weak to play.  Whatever it is you want to do go for it.  Play football or baseball or whatever sport you want.

"Came out, but still confused",WeirdAlienEyes56,ainbow,"Hi everyone! (Sorry this is an absolute mess of a post )
So recently I came out to most people I know as gay. I was certain enough about that to come out - I am attracted to other men.  But I dont think the term gay covers it? 

Initially I thought I was aromantic as well, because I was dating someone but didnt really feel involved in it at all, like I didnt really have an emotional connection to them. So I ended that relationship.

I thought about it some more and realised that Im not aromantic, because I got very attached to another guy after talking to them for a while. I thought (probably aesthetically) that they looked really good, and then it became more of sexual attraction - I think! I really dont know. So maybe Im demi?

I found in lots of gay subreddits that people get really thirsty over shirtless guys - Ive never done that. Ive watched porn before and found that attractive. I cant really remember ever having a crush on someone.

What does this sound like? Is this normal?

Hope this helps,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning family sorry im late checking in had a late night and I just woke up.  Hope you all are ok today.  You're so very special never forget it.

 So I want to see if I can help clear up a question I keep seeing.  I know not everyone will read this but it might help those who do.  So the question is am I bisexual.  Usually followed by the person explaining they aren't really attracted to the same sex.  You DON'T have to be attracted to same sex to bi you just have to be attracted to more than one.  So you can be a guy attracted to females demigirls and enby for example.  So many people assume bisexual means same sex and opposite sex but it just means more than one.  Also your ratio doesn't have to be 50/50 it can be any ratio and work.  Another thing I see usually hand in hand with this is im afraid might be bisexual.  The only reason to be afraid is if your young and worried about coming out otherwise being bisexual or anything else is nothing to fear.  Your sexuality and gender develope as you grow and mature its ok if you always thought you were hetero only to find out you're not.  For some this happens even into adulthood.  Don't let it worry you explore your feelings find out for sure no need to be scared.  I think when people have thought they were one way then start realizing they may be a different way now its startling but sometimes we grow up so deep in conservative values or hatred that its not until you're away from it your true feelings surface.  Its ok embrace it see what happens.  Just remember to be safe and stay safe.  I know this post is about bisexuality but it can apply to others like pansexual polysexual etc... There is no magic definition for most that you must meet except for homosexuality that's strictly same sex but you can still have preference.

does this sound like a crush to you guys? how weird is this? is this a sign that i figured out my orientation?,peppathesheep,ainbow,"for a little while, i've been trying to figure out my sexuality. like am i straight? bi? aromantic? etc. i have come to the conclusion that i'm asexual, but i'm trying to figure out my romantic orientation. i think i may be homoromantic. i thought i was aromantic until i dove a little deeper into my feelings for this girl. i kinda thought i couldn't stop thinking about her because i missed her friendship but i feel like it's deeper than friendship. recently, i've been obsessed with this one girl i used to see a lot. she was a new kid at the school and i introduced myself to her because i found we had something in common. we were school friends for about 4-5 months until lockdown. i miss her so so much and i wish we became much closer. i look at photos of her a lot and i think about her daily--don't get me wrong i love thinking about her. we don't talk anymore but the feelings are still there. i miss her so much but i don't know if i can talk to her anymore. i'm too scared since we aren't even friends anymore. i haven't talked to her since march 2020. i feel like she forgot about me. when i saw her in march 2021(i went to school to take the SAT and she was there), all we said was hi to each other. she never really mentioned her sexuality--i have a feeling she doesn't know--but she said she used to be bi and that she's not gay. i fantasize about her sometimes and i made up a story in my head where her and this other girl are dating. i replay moments in my head of her doing cute things such as hugging me, talking to me about personal things, the little things she does, and our handshake. i've always noticed little details about her and i remember the little things she does. i admire them. for example, she has a really gentle voice and she used to lay her head on my shoulder. i thought that was so cute. she also would play with her hair sometimes and i remember when she would compliment my eyes and hair. i just wanna cuddle with her and take her places. i just wanna watch the sunset and enjoy the cool breeze while having deep convos with her. i just wanna hold her little hand and make her feel loved. i miss her and i'm sad that i couldn't talk to her as much. i regret not making our relationship deeper."

so we got to thinking, is this a thing during pride month?  if not, how's it not a thing?  imagine everyone wearing the same color each day for 1 week to either kick off or close out pride month  how awesome would that be?

if this is already a thing, then i'll shut up and go away.  if it's not a thing, then i think it would be a good thing to make a thing."
Surprised at work,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hello family and good evening, afternoon or morning.  Dad here just checking in hoping you had or are going to have a good day.


So nothing like a surprise at work to become the topic of my next post.  Most of yall know I came out at 14 and was kicked out.  From the till now I had not heard or spoken to my father.  I did see my mother earlier this year when I heard she was in the hospital.  My dad made a point not to be there when I went by.  Today he showed up at my work out of the blue.  I figured something must have happened to mom.  I went out to his car first thing out of his mouth you still queer.  I said if you're asking if im still bisexual yes.  He said I came by hoping you gave that up and we could be family again.  I told him even if I had we'd never be family again the way they treated me.  He drove off after that.  I learned a long time ago toxic people even if they're family have to be cut from your life like a cancer.  Toxic friends and family will only hold you back you don't need them.  Surround yourself with people who will inspire you and lift you up.  People who want to see you achieve your dreams.  If they add nothing to you move on.  I lost a lot of blood family when I came out but they're all toxic anyway.  I have a new family now and we support each other and hold each other up.  Its not how many friends you have its how many of those friends you can truly rely on.  My DM's are open if you need help deciding if people need to be cut from your life.

Remember I love you always

In 2018 the Mayo botched my bottom surgery,Askili,ainbow,"In 2018 they ignored my pain.

They said I was making it up, or that it was in my head.

Their pain management team ignored what I told them about the pain meds.

Their nurses refused to provide me the IV pain meds the surgeons ordered.

They tried to push me out before the full 7 days I was told I could be in the recovery ward.

In 2019 I had to get a revision surgery. It left me sicker and in more pain than before - not necessarily the surgeon's fault, the surgery went fine. I just caught CDiff, and it was right at the start of Covid. But either way, I nearly died. I threw up every day for months. I am still struggling with my health.

In 2021, the Mayo, after moving back in with family due to my failing health and inability to work, is now refusing to provide me the estrogen they initially prescribed. At the dose they prescribed.

I live in a small town in Minnesota, I can't drive, I have no income.

And now I have no estrogen."
How to tell parents about engagement,rsandr,ainbow,"Hi folks! I'm a queer late 20's woman who is getting engaged this weekend (my girlfriend and I are typically bad at surprises and such but it'll still be great) and while i'm excited I also honestly- I have a lot of fear. 

I've been with my partner for 6 years, known her for ten. She has met my parents but we live in Washington state and my parents are back home in Michigan (we are potentially moving there next year to be closer to them). I have been around her family a lot and we are very close to her siblings. While my parents have met her and done a couple vacations they don't know her as well as her parents know me. 

I didn't come out to some of my larger extended family until a bit later in our relationship and my Grandma only found out last year. 

I still feel like my parents, my Dad especially still would have hoped that I had ended up with a man (i'm bi) and to be totally honest I don't know if some of my Dad's side and his friends are even aware i'm in a committed happy relationship. To be clear my Dad has never been outwardly homophobic but he does go to a mega church that I disapprove of. So I'm not sure what information he receives. 

I was going to tell my Mom in advance so maybe she could ease my Dad into it. But I'm also just really scared that my parents, Grandma and other family members won't be as excited as they were for some of my cousins getting engaged etc. 

I'm not sure how much I'm just over thinking because of anxiety but I haven't been as excited about us getting engaged because of this fear. So any advice or just validation would be helpful to me."

Hey good morning,afternoon or evening depending on where you are.  Dad checking in on everyone making sure you're ok.

You know its important for people to check in on us and remind us we're valid and loved.  So many times life punches us in the gut and we get down and discouraged.  We have days where it seems like everything goes wrong and we can't do anything right.   We are filled with worry and anxiety and yes we wonder sometimes if people or the world would be better without us.  Family listen to me.  YOU ARE LOVED YOU ARE VALID!  We all have bad days but we have to pull ourselves up and keep going.  I know its easier said than done.  Ive been there.  Feeling i was worthless contemplating suicide but I didn't.  I decided instead to show my parents and everyone else they were wrong.  You can too.  Its hard im not going to lie, but the feeling you get seeing the surprised look on their faces is worth it.  I can love and support you with everything within me, yet at some point you will have to do it for yourself.  Im always here for you just like a parent should be.  Ive told my oldest daughter all of this since she got pregnant.  Daddy can help but daddy can't do it all for you.  I will always love and support you.  My DM's are open to anyone needing to talk.

Hello, My name is Johnathon.

I am 20 years old and currently living in and around my Greek-Lebanese family's home in the outer suburban greater-Brisbane area, in Queensland Australia.

Ever since my family found out I am gay, living with them has gone from just strict to very difficult, to the point where there's practically more yelling and crying everyday. 

It's really very unpleasant and hard to stand much longer. I believe I will need a total of $2200 to move out and then become entirely self-sufficient and escape this abusive family life.
I have broken down exactly what that would go towards in my GoFundMe page, which I'm pretty sure I can't link on reddit in a post, but, it's pinned on my profile and everything is laid out in full on there.

 Yall I had the greatest experience awhile ago.  In the neighborhood where I live we have several houses that's been for sale one almost directly across the street.  Well it sold the other day and they were moving in this weekend.  About 2 hours ago someone rang my doorbell.  It was our new neighbors.  Mom dad and twin boys.  They wanted to introduce themselves and ask if we would be offended if they put up a rainbow flag.  I told them if course not most of us were LGBTQ of some sort and those who weren't were allies.  We talked a bit and i found out they had moved because the twins were trans male's and were being severely bullied.  The boys are 12 years old so they hoped by moving and not telling a lot of people other kids wouldn't know and bully them.  I told them to hang their flag proudly and not worry about what neighbors thought.  I think they asked everyone anyway.  Its flying proud though looks good.  I takes courage to be yourself in this world not just if your LGBTQ.  People hate anything different.  I applaud those who can break the norms and ignore the haters and be themselves.  I never want anyone to come out or anything if they're not in a safe environment.  But if you think you'll just have to put up with some offhanded comments or something and you want to come out then do it be free.  My DM's are open feel free to run your ideas by me if you want to.

I can't stand being gay anymore,Competitive_Ad816,ainbow,"Trigger warning: This is a very negative venting post. I am somewaht drunk and want to vent my posts anonymously on the internet. So don't read if you don't want something negative.

I live in a country where being gay is not socially acceptable at all (country is Jordan). If I am found out, my life is literally ruined; my career, my friends, my parents, loved ones, everyone will probably cut me off.

Moving away is really hard and expensive, and I can't afford it. I tried this route but it is very difficult. It's difficult to get a tourist visa in most countries where being gay is allowed, let alone move there, and my position in life does not allow me to move.

I am getting old and still a very horny virgin. I have never been with another man. I tried so many things to make myself straight and nothing has ever worked.

All of my friends are straight and they have girlfriends, boyfriends and some are married with children. It makes me burn with envy and jealousy. I can't stand this anymore.

I feel like I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life when my parents pass away.

I tried getting involved with the Jordanian gay community, but it's really underground, really really really hard to get into and even if I did, I don't see any way of having a meaningful relationship with anyone, as it always has to remain strictly secret and no one can ever find out. Plus, I don't have any connection or know how to make any connections to that community.

Self love,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning family hope you slept well.  Dad here checking in to remind you i love you and wish you the best.  

So I want to talk to you today about something I was helping someone with on Reddit.  No worries I never mention names or usernames. Honestly I can't believe I've never thought to talk about it before.  Self love or care.  How can we love others if we can't love or take care of ourselves.  This includes learning how to love ourselves as well as physically taking care of ourselves.  Eating right working out grooming properly etc.  We have to remember we are just as important as the ones we love.  We cannot keep giving into a relationship whether its with a partner or family or friends and get back in return.  Just like a car if were not maintained regularly we break down.  Sometimes we get so focused on everyone else we forget who we are. 

If you're feeling burned out and like your just over it take some time for you.  Take as much time as you need.  Some need a few days some a few months whatever.  During this time focus just on you.  Maybe get in shape or change your clothing style or hairstyle.  Try a new shampoo or body wash or perfume/cologne.  Visit the doctors and dentist and become the best you. Do some reflecting on what you need in a relationship both with a partner and with family keeping in mind you deserve the best as well.  Figure out what you like and don't like in a relationship including sexually if you've reached that point.

Once you figure it out then start giving to others again remembering you need something out of the relationship to.  If you're not getting talk to people tell them what you need.  If that doesn't help cut them loose and move on.  Your mental and personal wellbeing are just as important.  Never settle for less than you deserve.  Young people this applies to you to.  In school, relationship, life whatever you deserve the best.  Its not going to be handed to any of us. We have to work to get it but we deserve it.

Life is going to throw all kind of obstacles in your way.  Family, sickness, unexpected bills, friends trying to tear you down.  Rise above it fight for you because no one else will.  Once you realize you are worth everything you want you will never run out of giving and will never allow yourself to lack in a relationship again.

My DM's are open if you need to talk more about it.

Love always

So I was at a free concert in town earlier today and saw lots of pride merch being worn but what stood out was this boy 14 years old wearing a skirt.  Now it wasn't because he was wearing the skirt that made him stand out.  What made him stand out was he was taking time to explain to boys younger than him why he was wearing a skirt.  He was showing them that clothes have no gender so some boys enjoy wearing them.  He explained he felt more comfortable this way and that its up to them to find what works for them.  After he finished it talked to him told him how cool I thought he was.  He said hes wanted to wear dresses since he was 5 but was afraid to ask.  On his 12th birthday his mom was asking him what presents he wanted.  He finally got the courage to tell her how he felt.  Turned out she would have bought them all along.  Now he's dressing how he wants and is full of confidence.  Kids you know your parents better than I so don't put yourself at risk but if you're just afraid they'll say no and that's all take a risk and talk about what you want you maybe surprised.

So the kids and I were talking last night about feelings specifically in kids and teens. Lets face it puberty is brutal all on its on.  Hormones are kicking in your body is changing and you start really noticing your feelings happy, sad, angry, confused etc. Those are common for everyone in or starting puberty, but if you're also feeling you might be lgbtqia+ it really get messy.  Now your dealing with more feelings and more confusion and you've heard how some parents aren't accepting so now what do I do who do I talk etc.  No wonder kids are full of anxiety.  Its nerve wrecking and you have no way of knowing what do.  Not all schools are accepting so school counselor may not work.  Church its definitely out in most cases.  Friends don't know anymore than you do.  Obviously im here if you want to talk I've been through it with my kids but I know its weird talking to a stranger about your feelings as well.  Just know you're going to make it through it.  Most of the confusion will to away as your hormones level out and your feelings will sort themselves out eventually.

Theory on science of attraction,Ipluggucci,ainbow,"I know I am going to sound crazy but just give me a quick minute. 

Science tells us there is a polarity in all things. 

All living things have a soul which is energy. If you dont believe in the concept of a soul then we will refer to the bio electromagnetic field that surrounds all life which is fact. 

Which animals use magnetoception like birds for example to know where to fly during certain seasons, turtles to know to come to shore, the same magnetic field used by pigeons to relay messages. The electromagnetic field of the earth for example which tells us north on a compass. 

As we know brainwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation. Science has shown that brains undergone cat scans from someone homosexual or transgender can be extremely similar to the opposite gender of their assigned sex instead of the one given at birth. 

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/brains-of-gay-people-resemble-those-of-straight-people-of-opposite-sex

https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14146-gay-brains-structured-like-those-of-the-opposite-sex/

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8

Even though, Gender has become a social construct and a way we have boxed people into being who we want them to be as a society. Instead of understanding everyone is unique with their own likes and dislikes and accepting people for who they individually are. We have have attributed almost anything to acting like a girl, or acting like a guy. Just because some chick plays video games or a guy wears skinny jeans does not mean they are gay. 

But lets be honest Femininity and Masculinity are extremely polar in opposite ends, and opposites love to attract. 

||
Masculinity                                                                                                                          Femininity 

Attraction in reality is more than Physical. 

What if each human is Charged at a certain polarity between the levels of femininity and masculinity? Sometimes that feminine energy that a person has and how its expressed through (speech, actions, mannerisms, etc) is so attractive. Or the same can be said about a women attracted to someone on the other end pulled by their Masculinity. What if this gives people their Gaydar that gave you that sense of extra femininity from that one male friend that came out the closet and you had to act shocked about it. Or maybe somebody trans is charged in polarity to the whole other end.  What if some people are in the damn middle like Prince? What if some are not charged at all? 

What if the polarity of a person was mutable(fluid) for some and not fixed like some others?

What if everyone could be realistically, attracted to different combinations of a polarity of a person. Some people prefer a persons polarity and how its expressed prioritized over elements on a physical level.

Being a straight man that is attracted to femininity and saw Carmen Carrera or another trans women on the street and thought she was attractive isnt gay because he in his masculine is attracted to a person who has extreme feminine energy and expresses it. 

Maybe, as we advance and study the science of attraction, we can come to a point of scientific proof that God made me like this"

Anyone else feel dirty and gross after random fun?,OutrageousAsk1284,ainbow,"Hey so this might not make sense but maybe I (39M) feel this way each time because of anxiety that I have and a worrier.

I have not slept much, been single since 2012, and a few years after decided to have fun every now and again. Not had fun with many guys recently....as in the past year I've seen this local guy....you know one of those ""straight guys"" he does not fancy guys bit likes the sexual part of stuff... We only really meet for oral because I do not like anal anything anymore.

Used to be a bottom years ago went totally off it and tried topping but lost of time didn't work or did nothing for me....I'm not really a top or bottom


Anyway each time we did something he would go...it was always a quickie with him lol, I would feel instant regret but feel gross and dirty get a shower and wash wash wash. 

Well tonight....actually 1 HR ago (I got back 25 mins) I had a meet with another local guy I know...he's well known round here so it's a hush hush meet since he's known to be straight again just kissed and mutual oral no  swallowing as I would worry even more.


Got back and felt gross and dirty again so I gargled with TCP (here in the UK....it's a antiseptic liquid for cuts etc but you can gargle it for ulcers and sore throats...diluted) so I gargled it to clean my mouth etc. And because I felt even more gross I got in the shower and poured it over where were both.... shot (sorry lol had to put that) I had wiped all that with baby wipes. So poured TCP on my stomach and chest and then over my dick and washed everywhere,. It then I did it again with shower gel.

I know this is going overboard but I felt I had too. Anyone else do similar...not the TCP part lol.

I do know also this will be my anxiety as it's been a nightmare of mine to catch anything. Even back to when I was 12 or 13 when I realised I was different...as in maybe gay and I thought it meant I would automatically get aids...this no doubt down to crap on TV when it all used to talk about gay men and hiv and aids.

I think it may be down to that :/

When the ex got herpes by another guy, the guy that I was seeing was there for him and willing to take the risk. He gave him so many chances and the ex never changed. Last week he applied for a new apartment and leave the ex for good. I was with him all the time, supporting and making sure he was okay. Then the ex was able to manipulate him and make him cancel the application that was so close to be approved. This week he had enough because the guy starting talking sh*t about me and breaking more stuff. He applied again and got approved. The ex started to cry, text &amp; call from different numbers and telling him that if he didnt grab the phone he was going to tell everyone and ruin his future. He was planning to go to his job and make a scene and tell his family and friends too. He was so hurt and sad and I was there for him the whole time and I was so hurt for all the thing he was experiencing. I felt a really strong connection with him and we would even talk for hours about the future. A few hours passed and he got approved to the new apartment and I told him there was no going back and he agreed. He signed everything and the ex kept calling and crying and was able to change he mind once again. He called my crying asking for advice. He wanted both of us because the other guy is his first relationship for 5 years and I was able to make him feel loved and supported. I was very hurt but didnt want to tell him what to do so I told him that he was old enough to know whats best for him. He then spoke with his ex and the ex told him to cut me off from everything which he did.. Im very hurt and dont know what to do. I tried to move on but it hurt so much because I really opened myself to him. We even cried together once and Ive never done that with any guy.

TW: Transphobia in the largest Among Us Discord server. I was warned for the message 'Trans women are women'. Multiple instances of transphobia and racism.,InconsistentWithName,ainbow,"This was deleted from the Among Us official subreddit, for some reason. If you have any suggestions on where I could post this to people who would care, please let me know.

I used to be a fan of Among Us and it's such a shame that there are bigots representing the community. This all took place in the largest Among Us server (according to Disboard). I joined a call, played a game (which was completely obnoxious by the way - loud sounds down the microphone and multiple racial slurs). I went into the general chat and sent a couple of messages.

Someone then said something along the lines of 'trans women in women's sports is sexist towards women'. An admin was in the chat and did not care until multiple people argued against it. The admin simply said 'change the topic'. The transphobe went on to say 'trans women are men', to which the admin did NOTHING. I replied to the transphobic moron saying simply 'Trans women are women.' The admin WARNED ME for saying 'Trans women are women.'

I watched the chat for longer to look for more toxicity and found some blatant Nazis and transphobia which was completely ignored. I saw [this blatant transphobia](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779009130634936324/868260356340998194/unknown_5.png) being COMPLETELY IGNORED. I was then curious just how bad it was so I searched for the word 'tr\*nny' yielding 89 RESULTS.

We CANNOT have transphobia rampant in Among Us. I thought we were better than this.

[My last few messages.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779009130634936324/868246932236144720/unknown.png) The admin ignored all of my calls for help related to the transphobe.

[The first messages in which the admin did NOTHING to stop the transphobia.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779009130634936324/868249144114966608/unknown_3.png) There were also other facetious comments like 'gg' which the admin did NOTHING to stop. There were also users using the right-wing dogwhistle 'trains' which I have been insulted with multiple times.

I know I don't post here much, but you can [see I'm a regular](https://www.reddit.com/user/BecomingJess) over at r/MtF; I just wanted to cast a wider net!

If you have any questions about the job or about the listing, please message me!

# Responsibilities

You would be responsible for the following tasks:

* Systems validation and deployment

### Core Requisites

You should have a good amount of experience in the following areas:

* Planning for, deploying, and supporting systems over time
* Strong knowledge of the Linux operating system
* Deep understanding of network protocols and behavior, including typical home network environments
* Experienced with Python and Linux shell (bash) scripting
* Excellent troubleshooting skills
* Skilled with software testing and test automation

# Benefits

I can vouch for these! The health coverage is Aetna, which is kinda meh from a trans standpoint in that it only covers therapy, HRT, bottom surgery, and top surgery (though from what I've gathered you can finagle some other stuff if you push hard enough). There is a plan though that has reasonable copays and **zero** coinsurance or deductible, which is amazing -- and I see two therapists, 4-6 times a month, and Aetna pays for it all (other than $30 copay) without complaint, so that's a thing. The premiums are very reasonable, even for the best tier (the one I've got).

* Inclusive culture and team\*

We also have a #pride slack channel with 10 folks in it. I can personally vouch that homophobic/transphobic techbro BS is absolutely **not** tolerated here!"
Raise them right,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey dad checking in on ya seeing how you are.  You know your all so special I really mean that its a joy for me to be able to share with yall.  

So I ran into the coolest family today.  I was just at the grocery store and i saw this boy 9 years old with a rainbow shirt rainbow converse and rainbow bracelet.  His mom was with him she too was rainbow dressed as well.  Not sure if they were part of the community i simply said yall nice in your rainbows.  The son spoke up before mom had a chance to say anything. He said we're supporting my sister she's a lesbian. To which I replied that's very cool I'm part of the community myself I'm bisexual. He said yeah I think I might be too but I'm not sure yet. I told him he didn't need to be in any hurry there was plenty of time for him to figure it out. I just thought it was so cool how supported the whole family was being with his sister. He said why wouldn't we be she's my sister she's not any different. Folks that's how parents do it right. That boy realized his sister was still the same person regardless of who she loved. If all parents would instill that in their children then we wouldn't have all the homeless and hurting lgbtq youth that we have.  It was so sweet seeing the love in that boys eyes for his sister it really made my day.  My DM's are open to anyone who needs to talk.

I love sharing upbeat and good stories when I have so I hope this one helps you lift your spirits today.  So I was eating at a local restaurant with my kids last night and saw the coolest thing.  There was a large party at a table near us about 15 people kids and adults.  The kids appeared to range in age from 13-16.  The kids had all planned this out so they could all come out together.  They all appeared to be family so my guess is they were cousins.  Anyway as they were eating they decide to make their announcements to their parents.  You could tell they were nervous but we watched to see what would happen.  After the announcement the parents sat there a minute all stood up removed their shirts to reveal t-shirts underneath that were rainbow color and read we already knew we are so proud.  At this point everyone in the restaurant knew what was happening and began to clap.  It was one of the most touching things I'd seen.  It just goes to show there are good accepting parents out there.  I know some of you need that acceptance my DM's are open if you want to talk and receive it from me.  I will accept you and love you unconditionally.

Just wanted to tell someone,Otherwise_Stoned,ainbow," 

&gt;My room mates friend stayed the night with her and left us alone when she went to work the next morning (yesterday) so I got myself ready while we were just hanging around the apartment i waited for him to be walking towards the couch and I walked up behind him and he saw my shadow and turned around and boom we locked eyes and I just kissed him just a peck at first and he grinned after he kissed me back and we started making out standing in the living room. I knew i was going to get laid when i felt his ice-cold hands inside my sweatpants with a grip on my butt. I pulled his dick out of his gym shorts and started giving him head.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't think I'm the most skilled dick sucker, but I like it none the less stroking the shaft as I'm sucking on the head up and down. He's glancing between me and the ceiling with the hottest look on his face. My jaw starts getting sore so iIget up and just say ""I want you"" as i bend over the ottoman and his hand instantly goes up and licks his finger and starts fingering me. omg this is the hottest feeling as he positions himself behind me and i feel the head start pushing. We got it going and it was great. He wasn't afraid to moan which is so hot. I love it. He hit it from the back for a while and i would occasionally lean back and kiss him a few times.  
&gt;  
&gt;I crawled forward and got up and laid on my back and he got on top and kissed me good for a few minutes while stroking my dick before finding himself back inside me. I was holding up my legs and he started stroking me so good while he was trying to time is cum stopping and pulling out and the starting again real slow. I started feeling myself build up and I tried to hold it back until i couldn't anymore. I couldn't help the yelp/moan that echoed through the apartment when i exploded all over my stomach, chest, neck etc... I felt him shake and shutter and moan a little as the warm slickness of his deed got to him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now we got to clean up this mess! ;) lol Him cumming inside me was kind of a party foul but i talked to him about it. We'll definitely be hanging out again : )"

From gay to straight,Just_Perspective_134,ainbow,"Yes, I know..., so hear me out. STORYTIME

I for a very long time had a close gay friend who I in the end fell in love with (shocking, isnt it). And I am like the most awkward shy boy out there so I kept my mouth shut quite some time. He himself was like any normal guy who was interested in feminine guys, although he was closeted in the family, he was not afraid to admit to friends that he indeed was gay. He also was actively looking for a boyfriend. Some years ago all of sudden the whole exchange between us became very cold, almost being super close besties from one day to not knowing you the another. That lasted about few months until I had the guts to ask what had changed. And I am fine when people decide that friendships do not work anymore or they feel down or whatever. At that point I just thought he probably had focus on some guy. So I decided to just ask what was going on. But what came next made my bunghole drop on the floor and run away. He admitted that he had found himself a girl that he has feelings towards. He also admitted for not feeling attracted to men anymore and found uncomfortable being around me because i was a gay guy (noting that this all happened in basically 3 month period). That was about it, I did say in the very end that I had felt love towards him and then said our last goodbye. I accepted it although grinding my teeth to dust and poking the voodoo doll. Shortly after he backed away from our mutual friends as well. That has been it. SO, what you guys think it was about? Maybe he was confused? Never gay in the first place? I guess my question is not even specifically about him, rather than about the community as whole. There are a lot of confused folks out there, but rarely I at least see where its in that direction."

Camp?,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning dad here hoping you have a great day and remember you are loved.


So I want to talk about an article I saw and get yalls opinion on it.  A Lutheran church in Arkansas did an lgbtqia youth camp.  LGBTQIA youth could go and explore who they are and learn about their sexuality and gender.  They did fashion shows where kids could explore different styles.  They had group sessions where you could learn about the different sexualities and all that fall under each umbrella.  Of course they had fun activities like any other camp.  Now I know the ones who could really benefit from it their parents won't let them go.  That aside for the youth who's parents would let them go it would be awesome for them.  I would like to see something nationwide or even worldwide not necessarily sponsored by the church.  Other than fashion shows what would you like to see at a camp like this.  Maybe makeup tutorials or hairstyle session let me know what you'd like to see.  My DM's are open or you can comment on the post

Be educated when your ready to come out so you can tell friends and family exactly how you know.  Parents always assume we don't know what we are we're just confused or being influenced.

is there a more well-known label that could fit me? I am asking because identifying as a lesbian only because I like afab people may come off as transphobic, and I really dont want to be transphobic, as I am non-binary myself.

while id prefer anywhere in the northeast, i could reasonably go anywhere since im not exactly anchored down here (or rather, i wont be once i get my own car soon). if i can help it, i want to avoid Texas, Florida, and California, but if any of those end up being my only options, i wouldnt object"
Loss an ugly word,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger warning: loneliness,loss and homophobia


Hey fam dad checking in to see how you are.  I hope your day was good or if its just starting i hope it will be good.  You are all amazing and wonderful and I'm so proud of all of you.

Lets face life is full of loss.   We lose friends sometimes over arguments.  We lose love ones to death.  We lose pets etc.  Everyone will experience loss sooner or later, but those of us in the LGBTQIA+ community in my opinion experience needless loss.  We lose parents and family and friends all because they disapprove of who we love.  They turn their backs on us for something we can't control.  They get so deep in their religious or personal beliefs that they choose that over us.  Now I know they are free to believe and feel how they want, I just want to understand how you can hold on to beliefs that sepetate you from your kids.  Even if they don't kick you out the relationship is never the same.  Now some of you are fortunate to have accepting and supportive parents hopefully y'all are in the majority and those with unsupportive parents are in the minority.  The question becomes how do you overcome it.  You create a new family one of LGBTQ friends and allies.  People who will love and support you regardless of who you love.  No it won't be as good as parents who are supportive.  Ive been out for 34 years and still wish my parents would accept me but so far it hasn't happened.  My LGBTQ family and allies are great and they help me a lot when im feeling down.  That's how I overcome my loss of family.  I want to be part of your LGBTQ family.  If you need to talk or just need a hug or whatever reach out im glad to help.  My DM's are open to all who need me.

"Can you give me arguments against ""everything is like sexual activity""?",North-Ad1822,ainbow,"I found out about this ... whatever this is:

&gt;""If you view gentitals as connection points, then sexual activity becomes deteritorialized, and therefore allows everything to be viewed as sexual interplay. Someone speaks from their throats, another gets penetrated by the sounds in their ears. Sexual activity is interplay, tonal interplay forms and births new chords, sounds, and from this songs unfold. All of music is a swirling orgy of tonal interplay, and from this interplay our ears are penetrated.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unburdened and untethered by the traditional conception of sexual activity, we can see sexual activity all around us, from the way a bird cries out, to the way a wolf pack howls. Mickey mouse's metaphoric genitalia penetrates our psyche and mind with desire.""

It was a ""quote"" by a blogger. Basically, everything from listening to music, to opening the door is based on sexual activity and is a reminder of sexual activity...? E.g. When one listens to music, their ears get ""penetrated"" by the sounds, when one eats something, their mouth gets ""penetrated"" by the food, when one watches something, their eyes get ""penetrated"" by whatever they watch, and when one opens the door, the door or door handle gets ""penetrated"" by hands ... ?

So on, and so forth.

What do you think? Can you give any arguments against those comparisons?"

Two small gestures by myself and another person paid off today to help an LGBT kid feel more welcome,GregsPlantVlogs,ainbow,"Today a new volunteer, high school age, at a place where I volunteer asked me for my pronouns then gave me theirs, presumably because a) I was friendly b) I had a small trans-inclusive pride flag button pinned to my cloth face mask. 

A couple hours later, I noticed they were being misgendered despite the person doing the misgendering being implicitly corrected by others. I asked the new volunteer if they wanted me to say something on their behalf to management. I offered because I figured them being new, them being a kid, and them potentially getting backlash from the person doing the misgendering could make them wary of saying something themselves. They accepted the offer. I reached out to a senior staff person who I know is an LGBT ally and they said they would get everyone on the same page regarding the new volunteer's pronouns.

I don't think the new volunteer would've told me their pronouns if I hadn't put the pride button on my mask. I wouldn't have identified the staff person I contacted as a trans ally if they hadn't put their pronouns in their email signature. Even if it feels like everyone who knows you well IRL knows you're LGBT+ or an ally, it can still be helpful to visually identify yourself as an ally to people who might not know who to turn to, especially in a workplace environment."

I also had crushes on some guys, but I enjoyed it more when it was a girl. I remember having super strong feelings, I would even go as far as to say love, for some girls in middle school and high school.

1. Explicitly state in meetup description that allies are welcome, and allow them to come.

2. Dont mention anything about allies in meetup description, and if any do come, and they are respectful, then leave them be.

If you like being more feminine do it.  If you want to grow your hair out guys or cut it short girls do it. If you're trans embrace it and own it be the you that's inside waiting to be revealed.  Girls if you like looking more masculine do it.  If you want to enby and androgenous then do it. Be as wild or mild as you want to be.  Lets shake the world up and start a queer revolution.  Don't be afraid to let your light shine.  There's a place in this world for everyone you just have to create it sometimes.  I love each one of you unconditionally you all inspire me as you fight to be the real you.  I know some of you can't fully be yourself at home.  Just know around me you don't have to hide who you really are.  Be proud to be wherever you fall into the LGBTQIA+ community you are valid just like you are don't change for no one.

So my nephew and I were talking last night he was feeling kinda down.  Seems people were talking crap about him cross dressing.  Here's the thing and this is what I told him.  When you're being yourself and pushing the limits of societies norms you're always going to have haters.  People love to hate on different especially unique and different.  They don't understand why you in my nephews case have to wear dresses and makeup.  Why some gay guys go to extreme in their dressing being overly flamboyant.  It irritates them that you're not afraid to be unique and different.  Im glad we are different this world would be so boring.  So dye your hair, wear your outlandish clothes paint your nails whatever it is that makes you unique do it.  That's how you deal with haters by showing them their opinion doesn't matter to you.  As parents we should encourage that uniqueness and embrace it with you.  If you need support im here my DM's are open.  Run your unique ideas by me I will help you live your dream.

My kids and I were talking last night about random things you know how was your day etc.  We like to unwind and just talk about whatever comes to mind sometimes.  Well last night my nephew asked if after he researched a little more if he decides he is indeed trans would I help him become my niece.  Of course I said yes if he's trans female I will gladly help him.  He's going to wait 1year and half until he's 18 so he doesn't need parents permission.  The girls were all excited because they will all be shopping together and helping plan their weddings etc.  I asked if he had thought of a new name yet or if he was going to use the one he uses now when he cross dresses which is Amber Nicole.  He said hes not sure but will be thinking about it.  Hes going to use the time before turning 18 to really be sure and research what all is involved he said.  Then he broke down crying and I asked what's wrong.  He said he was so happy and  thankful I provided a place where he could be free to explore and find out what his feelings really were instead of hiding, then we all cried happy tears.  Its sad to think so many kids suppress their true selves out of fear or guilt instead of being free to explore.  I wish I had a way to help educate parents that were willing to learn but for now im here for those who need understanding parents all you have to do is reach out my DM's are open to all

My oldest daughter the ones that pregnant I found out today her boyfriend the babies daddy is homophobic and racist.  He knows im bi we've been getting along great so I was surprised today to find it out.  We were out shopping with my daughters and as we were getting back into the car a pick up truck drove by with two girls in it.  Its a nice ford f150 he commented how nice the truck was then added except its being driven by a black lesbian.  This old guy here has been out of the closet too long to let it go (sorry Elsa).  I said first off lets get 2 things straight 1 her color has nothing to do with anything she's a woman period.  Second how do you know she's a lesbian.  His response she's dressed like a man.  I went off.  I said clothing has no gender so far as you know its more comfortable to her.  She may or may not be a lesbian until she tells you you will never know.  Now lets make something very clear I will not tolerate racism or homophobia around my grandchild if you wish to continue seeing my daughter you got to get that backwards way of thinking out of you.  I don't know if it did any good and honestly if they stay together and he doesn't change hes not allowed in my house.  Sorry for the rant just had to vent some more.  My DM's are open to anyone who wants to talk or needs advice.

"Is it true or false that homophobia is small to nonexistent in canada, usa, etc?",SnowBananas7488,ainbow,"If there are any gay people in usa, canada, etc here, could you check whether or not these claims are true?: [https://imgur.com/wHwtKOu](https://imgur.com/wHwtKOu)

&gt;I'm in Canada. Homophobia is almost nonexistent, reasons:  
&gt;  
&gt;1- They had a whole news story on the changes in figures as part of Pride month. They showed the majority of republicans were for gay rights. Even in USA, it was a NARROW majority, but most were for gay rights.  
&gt;  
&gt;2- Probably only like 10% of the population in Canada and USA are homophobic. It's the vocal minority that is behind the homophobia, and the majority just 'goes along with it'. Sort of 'bystander effect'.  
&gt;  
&gt;3- Now, the majority doesn't go along with it here, I'm just saying if they do ...  
&gt;  
&gt;So yeah, homophobia is little or nonexistent in USA and Canada. Most of the homophobic things that happen now are more 'personal', less societal if you understand what I mean. There's no reason why gay people in USA and Canada wouldn't want to come out, or would complain about homophobia.

The claims are that in canada, usa, etc, ""homophobia is small to nonexistent"" "", ""homophobia is more personal and less societal"", and ""only a (vocal) minority are homophobic"", therefore ""most gay people do not experience homophobia"", in such countries."

Identity Questioning,yond_deputy84,ainbow,"Details: I am biologically female, and as far as I know heterosexual. However, I am questioning my romantic orientation as well as my gender identity (no plan to transition, just trying to figure who I am).

Been using She/Her and They/Them pronouns my whole life so Im used to it, but I am not sure what to feel about He/Him (could anyone use try it out under the comments for experience?) 

I dont care about my gender expression  or have a label for them. Currently contemplating whether Im epicene or bigender (man &amp; woman). 


Dont have any contact with people except for family members so I couldnt explore my romantic side out. When fantasizing, my attempts are more like trying to relate to peoples feeling, not as what I feel in life. 

TLDR; maybe Im biromantic, and either epicene or bigender? Can someone give advice on how I can figure out who I am? Try using the He/Him pronouns on me as well?"
Older cis-gender straight female trying to understand,LadyofLA,ainbow,"Hi.

I'm 73, politically left and religiously non-believer.  I'm pretty open minded and don't think any part of my life is threatened in any way nor do I have any wish to stomp around in anyone else's.  All that said, I confess to enormous confusion.  

I've had and lost dear friends who are gay.  That's been present in my life for at least 50 years.  I was aware of cross dressing.  But with respect for the rest of the spectrum, for all my 70 years there was Christine Jorgensen when I was in elementary school and too young to appreciate what was going on, and then Rene Richards in the 70s.  And that's it.  I thought they were 2 very unique people and were the entire population of people who were other than straight or gay.  

Today there are so many expressions of gender and sexuality.  It seems to have come on like a sudden tidal wave and, frankly, I just can't wrap my mind around what's happening.  I know, again, no one needs my permission or my consent or my understanding.  Hand to god, I accept that.  But it would help me to deal with people as people if I could grasp some of the complexity of the possibilities.

I find this very difficult to talk about because 1) it's very personal and none of my business on an individual level, 2) I don't want to be an asshole in a general public discussion and 3) I have no *vocabulary* to be appropriate or to make myself clear.  I don't know what pronouns to use.  I don't know what labels are simply accurate and accepted.  I don't know how many places on the spectrum need to be acknowledged.  

Yesterday I ordered a salad in a restaurant from someone who had every  appearance of being male but a very powerful energy of being female.  I'm not talking about voice.  I don't remember the voice.  It was just a very strong sense of dissonance that had my attention.  Anyway, it wasn't abstract theory.  Suddenly it was a profound experience.  That 3 minute everyday exchange over what I was having for lunch and how I would pay for it will stay with me as a unique event for a long time to come.  I'd just like to understand."
(m31) I've been in a relationship for 5 months and still haven't told my partner (m35) I'm trans.,ThrowRA23235545,ainbow,"I know what y'all are thinking and yes, I do feel like a horrible person. I just have a really bad relationship with being trans. I don't feel proud of this part of myself at all. No one in my life knows about it, except my two ex girlfriends. There are even times I completely forget I'm not cis. But when it comes to my relationship with my partner, I think about it every time I'm with him. Because I'm so afraid of him finding out. Not because I think he'd think less of me. He's a very intelligent, open minded and  considerate person. And a doctor. I'm just too humiliated. And I'm very deep in denial of the parts of me that aren't masculine. I have no idea how to deal with that if/when my partner and I get close on a sexual level. And at this point it would be so awkward to tell him. After so many months and after 2 years of knowing each other and being friends. I wanted to tell him sooner but I kept postponing it further and further and now I'm in this very embarrassing situation. I know it's not okay of me. He keeps diving into a relationship with me without knowing a very important thing about me."

How can I be an ally?,hcgator,ainbow,"If this isn't the right sub for this question, please let me know.

I'm pretty sure one of my employees is gay.  It doesn't matter to me if they are or aren't, and they are pretty private so we've never discussed it.

The other day we were all hanging out and the subject of spouses came up.  The group noticed that my employee is married by the ring and was asking gender specific questions about their spouse.  My employee answered all the questions but avoided volunteering any gender specific answers about their spouse.

Thankfully, everyone was more than satisfied with their answers and didn't push for more, but I was terrified that someone would ask ""What's your _____'s name?""

If a more specific question like that does come up, what can I do to help my employee out of an uncomfortable situation?"

Homophobia at its worst,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning virtual dad checking in on my family to see how you're doing.  Always remember I love you and you're awesome.  I don't like posting negative things but I can't ignore this. I saw a tiktok the other day some of you may have seen it.  The tiktokers son wears dresses and I believe specifically Disney princesses but not positive if he does others anyway regardless he's amazing and loves it i don't know his age looks 10 or so.  His mom says his confidence is through the roof and if you see his videos he's freaking awesome.  Now she got a comment the other day from someone who said if my son wanted to wear dresses I'd beat it out of him. Now she may get those more than I know but she addressed that one on tiktok.  I was like  Really really why what's wrong with you.  What kind of homophobic piece of parent trash are you too rather abuse your son than let him be happy.  I can't believe as far as we've come we still have this level of homophobia, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised hell we can't even get rid of racism.  You know what yeah I can believe because there's always going to be hate.  If we eliminate homophobia and racism it'll be something else.  As parents our response to our sons wanting to wear dresses or our daughters wanting to wear suits should be ok lets go shopping.  Never should we stifle our children's desires and creativity.  We need to encourage our children support them let them explore and express themselves the way they want.  Unfortunately most parents panic when their children go against the norm and their homophobia shows through. Now I know some of you have parents that are this homophobic mine were.  That's another reason I do this.  To give you an understanding parental figure to talk to.  My DM's are open to anyone who needs me.

My gay friend is receiving death threats! Is there anyway I can help him get out of the country and get asylum?,q1t0,ainbow,"We're both from a very Islamic country. My friend recently defended a very public figure in my country who came out as trans(He has since fled to Australia).

Even tho he hasn't come out publicly it's very obvious to everyone that he is gay. The fact he very openly defended a trans man didn't help the cause either.  So is there way he can escape our horrid country.

So, I'm currently unlabeled but I have no gender, &amp; like guys and nonbinary people.  


So I was trying to look for something to call myself- And I noticed something I saw no one else was talking about.  
Doesn't the meaning of bisexual and gay kind of overlap now? And more specific multisexual identities just confuse the hell out of me! Let me explain.  


Gay (as in gay men) means non-women attracted to non-women, correct- So, both men and non binary people are included, althought that's literally what bisexual means? Attraction to 2 or more genders? NB people surely aren't male, so would that not make it bisexual-? Or is the defintion of bi different now too...  
It's so confusing to me!!  


Now about the multisexual sexualities thing. I don't reaaally understand how one can like, for example, only exactaly 4 genders. There isn't a set amount of them, its a social construct (as much as i hate saying ""social construct"") so how would that work...? ""I'm only attracted to bigender, genderfluid, men, and catgender"" how would that work considering you obviously can't tell by just looking at someone? Do you lose the attraction when they're another non binary identity??

Unconditional love,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hi virtual family virtual dad checking in on ya seeing how you are and reminding you I love you.  I always tell my kids that there's nothing and I mean nothing they can do or say to make me stop loving them.  I really mean that even if they got arrested or wanted to be an exotic dancer I'd still love them.  It wouldn't be what I would choose for them but it doesn't change my love.  As parents we should be that way with our kids.  Our love cannot have conditions.  I can't say to my daughter I love you as long as you're not a lesbian or I love you as long as you don't fail a test etc.  No our love must be unconditional its the only way it works.  So many people though in the LGBTQ family had there parents love until they came out i know I did.  As soon as we came out though our parents love stopped.  It should never be that way.  That's why im here for you.  My love for you is unconditional.  No matter what you've done or what you've been through i love you.  I want to help you when I can.  Just like any parent all you have to do is ask.  Im not here to judge you Im not here to hate on you im simply here to love you like your parents should.  I really don't see why its hard for some parents.  My DM's are open to anyone who needs me.

Makeup, clothing, books, jewlery, pride flags etc.  Share one thing or more that would help you get through until you can come out.  My thought is between us all we might can help each other.  For instance a trans man might have makeup to give from before transitioning, someone may have feminine clothes to give and so on.  If we can help each other make it through it becomes easier on all of us.  It could be like an lgbtqia trading post.  Maybe it won't work but ya gotta admit its an interesting idea.  My DM's are open if you want to message me there or just comment here.

a fragment from an upcoming work (I write poetry) -- I'm transfem and I thought this would resonate with many of you. (cw: fears about *phobic violence.),dacryonwave,ainbow,"...so what if I were to *refuse* to fight,


to refuse to give up on nonviolence,


to hold on to what my heart knows to be true,


knowing all about me beauty's dire shades,


and no-one ever murders me to death


or tries to hunt or to hurt me down these mean roads


in redstate murica where I was assigned at birth,


and I emerge Chessmaster of the ages?


AND YET how dreadfully costly it were, to err ---


an error borne of faith in other souls,


or in long odds.  but what's the cost of the loss,


how exactly does one count the cost of the loss


of that which one holds most deeply?


the ghost within convicts one gravelier still


with dire edicts, unflinching sentences...."

"What are the arguments against ""men not being into women is misogyny and erasure of women""?",SnowBananas74800,ainbow,"Although ""being gay is misogyny"" is sometimes said as a joke, for amusement and laugher, there are times it is said seriously: https://imgur.com/LtCSC0M 

&gt;As someone who values heterosexual relationships and want to see them held to a higher stand, like ""elevated"" examples of them, gay relationships are the erasure of women to me. I want to see men care about women. It feels weird there are men that are gay and not into women. They ignore the positive relationship they could have with women, and relegate women to the sidelines. Being a gay man = being misogynistic. 

The belief is if a man is not into women, or doesn't want to be in a relationship with women, then he is erasing women from relationships and dating, treating women like they are ""not good enough"" and ""not worth it"", like they are ""inferior"", and that is misogynistic. 

Are there any arguments against that sort of thinking?"

How can I know for sure,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good day virtual dad checking in hoping you had a good night.  Don't forget you're loved and appreciated.  Today I want to address this question. How do you know for sure if you're any part of LGBTQIA+?  I see questions like I think im bi or how do I know if Im gay or whatever sexuality or gender you're' questioning.  Basically how can I tell for sure.  Its not uncommon for anyone especially kids and teens to question if they're sure they're gay or bi or lesbian etc. I say this because hormones and emotions run high especially during puberty so its understandable to feel confused, but adults go through it to sometimes.  Its not uncommon to see people coming out much later in life for various reasons.  Honestly there's no simple answer.  For some people they never doubt it they know right away from a young age in most cases they just knew no real explanation just knew.  For others they may start out for example bisexual then later think maybe im lesbian then later realize all along they were asexual.  Truth is there is no hard and fast formula to know for sure.  Here's some simple things you can do to help.  1. Do you have any attraction to people of same gender as yours romantic or sexual.  2. Could you see yourself in a relationship with someone of the same sexuality or gender as yours.  3. Are you attracted to people of all genders or at least more than 1 gender.  4. If you think you might be trans do you feel more comfortable being associated with the gender opposite your AGAB and do you have any dysphoria with your current gender.  These are very basic and again not 100% guarantee that if any of this applies your somewhere in LGBTQIA+.  Now if someone has anything they0p can add to this great please do I am in no way an expert this is simply a bi man's and fatherly perspective.  One thing I want to stress you DO NOT have to have sex with someone to know if your gay, bi, lesbian etc.  If you need to talk or have more questions please DM me my DM's are always open.

Finding out one of my favorite youtubers most likely wishes I didn't exist is kinda soul crushing =(,cerebrix,ainbow,"This one is hitting me so hard this morning.  Woke up, got some coffee, noticed one of my top 3 favorite you tubers, Quinn from Snazzylabs uploaded a new video.  I was thinking ""what a great way to start my day, I love his videos!"".

Video was on his 20 favorite Mac apps.  I found myself thinking ""this is really going to help me get my new MacBook Pro setup!"".

&amp;#x200B;

So I start watching, and then I get to the part where he's talking about one password and I notice, he's got a [login for the church of jesus christ (LDS)](https://youtu.be/h2xoRkzjQoc?t=1566).  As my head sinks down I can't help but look down to notice my queer, transgender body while thinking to myself ""wow, this whole time, this guy I really liked, wishes I didn't exist as a person"".

&amp;#x200B;

So I make a comment, and within minutes, it's deleted, as is every other comment anyone else made about the visibility of his LDS login.

&amp;#x200B;

I've loved this guys videos for years.  This hurts because, I mean I can't watch any more going forward obviously.  I mean, the mormon church spends probably more money than any other organization that im personally aware of (please, if there's worse, keep it to yourself this morning, I really don't want to get overwhelmed before lunch with my therapist) on efforts to remove my ability to marry someone, take away my rights in public, and do everything to take away as many tools as I might need to feel like a whole person in society via name changes, gender recognition on public documents.

Sticks and stones,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger warning: talking about bullying and hate speech


Hey its virtual dad just reminding you I love you and im proud of you.  Do you remember or have you ever heard the phrase, ""sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never harm me"".  I'd like to punch the idiot that said that in the damn mouth.  They evidently were never called; f** or q*** or any other slurs.  Words hurt and cut deep.  My nephew asked me tonight why he was a freak.  I was caught a little off guard but asked him why he thought he was a freak.  He said when he was at the mall today he overheard some guys making fun of a trans female calling her a freak.  Now my nephew is not trans but dresses feminine sometimes so he figures that means he's a freak.  I assured him he's not a freak no one is in my opinion.  Just because you are different doesn't make you not normal or a freak.  Most everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community has experienced something similar.  If you're gay you're too flashy or flamboyant.  No we just choose not to be dull.  If you're lesbian you're too butch or manly.  No they just know not all girls wear dresses.  If you're bisexual people think you ought to pick one.  Really have you been to baskin Robbins they have 36 flavors you gonna tell me you'd be satisfied with just one.  If you're trans you get things like freak or weirdo.  Really have you ever been so uncomfortable in your body you were suicidal try it sometime, and the list goes on.  My personal favorite though that we all get is sinner.  Now that's hurtful if you're a believer if your not it probably doesn't bother you.  For those who used to go to church its painful to hear.  For the record you're not sinner's but that's a different lesson.  Point is we are not freaks, we may not conform to your definition of normal but we are normal.  I truly believe if the heterosexuals knew the agony we went through deciding to come out they'd be more compassionate.  Yall I know words hurt and get you down hell I've been there, but you have to realize just because someone says it doesn't mean its true.  I know its going to take practice to get to that point but you can.  Just know I love you and here there is no judgements just love and understanding.  My DM's are open to you if you need anything.

Love always

Lean on me I'll support you,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger warning: depression and suicide


Hi virtual dad checking in on this rainy Sunday here in Georgia.  As always know I love you unconditionally and support you always.  Speaking of support who do you most wish you had support from.  Im not talking about financially but emotionally and encouragingly.  Who do you wish most was really in your corner fighting with you and helping you.  For most of us its our parents.  The ones who brought us into this world.  The ones who nurture and love us should be the ones who have our backs before anyone else.  Sadly however for a lot of LGBTQ people its not so.  Now I know there's non LGBTQ people like that to but generally LGBTQ kids lose it when they come out. You want to talk about destroying a kids self esteem imagine your parents supporting everything you do so you figure if I came out they'll support that to, only to do it and find out their support has limits.  It crushes a child and scar's them deeply.    Parents who don't support their kids don't see the psychological damage it causes.  It leads to severe depression, self harm and even suicide because they child  feels I will never be good enough.  Let me assure you that you are good enough.  If you live your life as best you know how and put forth the best efforts you can then your good enough.  I always tell my kids if you did your absolute best on a test and still get an F its ok im proud of you cause you did your best.  As a parent I have to know every kid is different which means their best is different.  We as parents have to also realize we support our kids not only in their successes but also their unsuccessful moments to, but we should never not support our kids when they come out.  Its terrifying to come out even with supportive parents.  Imagine being a kid and thinking about having to go tell your parents your gay for example.  You run a thousand different scenario's in your head about how it could go.  You stay awake at night agonizing over if you should and when you finally get the courage to do it (and yes it takes courage) your parents won't support you.  Can you imagine putting a child through that, yet I bet a lot of kids here have experienced exactly what im talking about.  I cannot let you go without being supported its why im here.  I lived my entire childhood and teen years without it and I vowed my children never would. I also want to make sure you never go without support again.  My DM's are always open to everyone who needs me.

Love always

"I made a comment on r/Cringetopia defending the idea that the movie Luca could be seen as as an LGBT allegory and now the entire comments section is flooded with ""NoT eVeRyThInG iS a MeTaPhOr FoR LgBt CrAp"" and I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now. :(",PeppyPiplup,ainbow,"Sorry if this isn't allowed. This is the first time I've ever posted here and I know this sub is a safe space and there's a rule against bringing anything negative into the sub and this post is pretty negative, but it just upset me so much that I need to get it out of my system and I don't know if it breaks the rule or not.

The post on r/Cringetopia was a screenshot of a an article with the title ""Is Luca a Gay Story?"" with a picture of the two main characters smiling and holding an ice cream cone. The title of the post itself was ""No no no no no no.""

The first comments on the post were shit like 

* ""Of course since everyone knows its impossible for two boys to be best friends they gotta be gay.""

* ""Hug equal gay now for some reason""

* ""Oh my god guys, I think I'm gay, I have a childhood friend since I was 2 years old ""

* ""It'll come the time where hugging someone will be considered sexual harrasment"" 

and another one that includes the word ""degenerates"" that I'm not going to repeat.

So that made go ""Uh, hang on. That's definitely not what the article is referring to."" 

So I decided to leave a comment saying:

* ""It's not gay because it's about two boys befriending each other, it's gay because it's like how Zootopia was an allegory for racism and prejudice. The movie's literally about two boys who have to hide the fact they're sea monsters to avoid being killed by close minded townsfolk who want to kill them because they are sea monsters.

Replace the word ""sea monster"" with ""gay"" it its a pretty fucking obvious metaphor for LGBT individuals living in conservative communities having to stay in the closet to avoid getting attacked on the streets.

Not cringe. Not even close."" 

Some guy had my back. They left a comment directly under mine saying:

* FFS theres two elderly single female roommates that COME OUT when the boys are accepted by society for who they really are."" 

And after that, various things happened.

Shortly after I made that comment, I received a message in my inbox that someone mentioned my username. And my username only. They literally left a comment saying ""u/PeppyPiplup"" under someone else's comment that said ""Pixar has stated specifically that it is not about gay people"", so basically the second commenter summoned me under a comment because it made them think of me and they wanted to bring me there as part of some ""See? You're wrong!"" type of thing. 

The biggest argument happened in one comment chain.

Person A commented that I was wrong for comparing Luca's metaphor to Zootopia.

* ""Yeah but zootopia was consistent with races being sepparated by carnivore and herbivore, it feels like this doesn't really work with luca in context because you would be saying two gay boys came from an all gay community and his two gay parents of the opposite sex come to get them by testing which kids were gay""

Person B responded with ""But the parallel with LGBTQ isn't the sexuality part but the oppression. The Folkstone want to kill seamonster because they look different and are afraid of them. The same can be said about the sea people who call the land people ""land monster."" Basically both side hate the other simply because they look different from one another. Gay people are/were harassed (even killed) because they are different.

To which Person A scoffed and said

* ""Right but what i'm saying is if you simplify the story that way you can stretch it to fit anything, it could just as easily be about jewish people in nazi germany. Taking the whole context of sea monsters being an entire race just breaks the connection of the theory for me""

Person B says:

* Its almost as if you can do that with everything and thats kind of the point of mass media. What doesnt make sense is people trying to invalidate the way that others experience a form of entertainment in relation to their own lives.

A third person chips in with

* ""Any metaphor will have flaws if you look for them. The gay part is that theyre not living life they way that society says theyre supposed to.""

To Which Person A responds:

* ""Right...because they aren't human, they are sea monsters. Ffs"" 

And then Person D joins the fray

* ""Sounds like you're desperately trying to shoehorn something into it that isn't there no matter how much you want it to be true.""

Person C again

* ""Sounds like youre desperately trying to pretend that something isnt there because it shatters your fragile heteronormative view on the world.""

And finally, Person D:

* ""Thats adorable sweetheart, tell me why do you think I'm straight? The world is full of things gay and straight, and that's what makes it fun and magical. What isn't is when it's forced or obsessed about, then it just becomes toxic. When the creator says it's not gay, then it's not, why do you even care so much about this, I don't. Seems to me like you're the fragile one that can't handle this film being anything but what you want, why else have you responded to near every single person that challenges your personal belief, you need this to be true."" 

Just a whole mess. Again, let me reiterate, I didn't say it WAS, I said IT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS.

Unrelated to that comment chain, Person B directly responded to my comment with ""So all the sea monsters are gay then? Right? Jfc enough with the everything is a metaphor for LGBT crap""

There's also another argument going on that basically boils down to ""They are literally 10 year olds."" ""Gay 10 year olds exist, also Gay does not equal sexualisation."" ""It literally means sexual attraction to the same gender. Stop romanticising 10 year olds.""

I don't know. I'm sorry you had to read that, I'm just tired and have a migraine and I really needed somewhere to vent. I used to browse Cringetopia purely for fandom content, but there's been a lot more posts attacking real people for things which aren't actually that cringey, yet they treat it as the worst thing ever because it's not the norm, if that makes sense. It's pretty alarming. I'm starting to think that perhaps I accidentally entered one of those subs that's become increasingly conservative and basically lit a fuse and invited trouble on myself and others.

 I was the first to say ""No, this is not cringey."" and others might have felt encouraged to back me up, but we all got swept up in a wave of backlash. I feel like it's my own fault, I probably should've just left that post alone and not commented on it, then I wouldn't have had to sift through so much junk replies in my inbox and upset myself, and then other people wouldn't have felt frustrated at the shit flowing into their own inboxes. Actually, now that I've said that, I really should be speaking out more against homophobia. Unfortunately, I'm just terrified of confrontation because I always get flustered and stumble over my own words and I just end of looking like an idiot.

 I'm just generally bad at getting a point across, so maybe people aren't misinterpreting my comment, maybe I am wrong because I couldn't explain it correctly or well enough. Heck, maybe I explained THIS post poorly and I've accidentally said or done something awful that I haven't picked up on.

 I just care a lot about Luca, and I've previously dealt with other people saying I was wrong for seeing Voyd as a lesbian in a previous Pixar movie. Representation is important and if you see yourself in a movie, you shouldn't have to deal with people mocking you and saying that you're wrong."

Never be ashamed,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey hope you're having a great weekend.  Virtual dad just checking on you letting you know you are so loved and appreciated. Do you remember when you had that aha moment where you realized you were gay or bi or trans etc. When you knew hey im different than my friends in who I like or how I feel about my gender.  For me I was 10 and I realized that when my friends were talking about cute girls I was like yea she's definitely cute and in my mind im looking at my guy friends thinking and so are you.  By the time I was 11 I was convinced it was so cool.  I could date boys or girls.  At that time I didn't know LGBTQ+ was so frowned on in the 1980's.  Despite that I remember feeling so excited and by the time I turned 14 I realized it was called being bisexual.  I thought if it has a name it must be ok.  My parents on the other hand didn't think so and kicked me out.  I remember though even when they told me if I said I was straight I could come back home i just couldn't.  I knew who I was and I couldn't change it.  It was a part of me its a part of you to.  Yes for some, gender and sexuality are fluid and change from time to time.  For others you know right off and it never changes.  Being LGBTQIA+ is not wrong its who you are. For me it was influenced by anything.  Friends or other social media etc.  The desire was deep and undeniable.  Never be ashamed of who you are.  Never let others belittle how you feel.  Be genuine to yourself and live life on your terms.  I DO NOT ADVOCATE COMING OUT IF ITS NOT SAFE!!!!!  For me personally getting kicked out of my house was the best thing that ever happened to me.  It humbled me and showed me how to love those who have no one to love them.  Don't get me wrong its a hard life I don't recommend it to anyone Im just saying I see the good that came from it. Its what allows me to be here for you.  Some of you have no one to love you well now you do.  Im here for you with arms wide open.  You don't have to be afraid to be who you are around me cause I love you just the way you are.  My DM's are open to anyone who needs me.

"What are the arguments against ""gay sex is heteronormative, because it emulates straight sex""?",MachineSecure9642,ainbow,"I often hear things along the lines of ""men evolved to penetrate women and their vaginas, and women evolved to be penetrated by men and their penises, therefore when gay people have e.g. oral sex, the penis penetrating the mouth (a hole) emulates straight sex which is penis penetrating the vagina (a hole), and is heteronormative"".

In other words, ""penis didn't evolve to penetrate anything other than the vagina, and the vagina didn't evolve to be penetrated by anything other than a penis. When gay men have penetrative sex of any kind, e.g. oral sex, the penis penetrates something (e.g. mouth) that did not evolve to be penetrated. The penetration of a hole such as the mouth emulates the penetration of the vagina, which is the only thing that evolved to be penetrated by the penis, and so gay sex, more specifically penetrative gay sex, emulates straight sex, and is heteronormative and bad"".

Same for when women finger each other, or use toys in lesbian sex, ""stimulating the vagina with fingers, mouth, toys, etc, emulates the stimulating of the vagina with a penis, therefore lesbian sex emulates straights sex, and is heteronormative and bad"".

Does anyone here have any arguments against that?"
How Do I Have a Relationship With My Catholic Fundamentalist Parents?,MentalGymnist23,ainbow,"TW: mentions of suicide, abuse, mentally unwell parents, neglect, self harm.

So I'm at a cross roads right now with my parents. (I'm also going to post this in multiple threads because I need as much advice as I can get), and am having a very difficult time trying to navigate a new relationship with them after everything that has happened.

Currently I am a 23 bi/pan non-binary Metis person. I haven't come out to my parents as non-binary yet and I'm not sure I ever will. My home life was incredibly abusive as my dad was constantly away for work and my mom was a non-existent parent. I basically raised my siblings and myself until I moved away for University at 18. They are also super Catholic and have bombarded me and my siblings with incredibly homophobic/islamaphobic/purity culture ideology under the guise of love and concern. My brother was in a depressive state for about 2 years because he thought he was gay and my parents just basically patted him on the back and said ""That's OK, you just will never be able to get married"".  I was constantly hating myself because I knew something was different about me, but the internalized homophobia (and probably the other abuse going on) drove me to harming myself multiple times. I only really started to accept myself when I went to high school. I came out to everyone, and then my parents last with the promise that I would never act on my homosexual desires. Which is an unhealthy thing to promise at 16, and unfair for my parents to hold me to as a child.

I met my wife in high-school and we've been inseparable ever since. My parents had never let her spend the night and have had every sort of issue with her spending time with them, or would be unwilling to compromise about something. I wanted them to know her and to see what an amazing person she was but it seemed they could never get over the initial hump of homosexual desire between us. The most confusing part about this is they know how corrupt and awful the institutional church is and actively discuss it. However when questioning some of the churches teaching, they refuse to see different. The churches teachings are absolute even though they were written by people who are nowhere near perfection.

I am trying my best to repair my relationship with my 3 other siblings who still live at home, but I'm so worried they're being poisoned against me when I'm not there. However in that regard there is only so much I can do until they move out. 

I love my parents very much, and around the time of my wife's and I's secular wedding, a lot of hurt and trauma happened. They had said they would attend out ceremony, then took it back after discussing it with their priest (This was a night a was pretty close to just driving my car off the pier and not dealing with any of this anymore). Now that my wife and I are starting to heal form our own individual trauma in childhood, I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm thinking about writing a letter and mailing it to them about my feelings on the matter as talking to them (as a group or individual) makes it easier to minimize how terrible they treated me as a queer person growing up. 

I also want to talk to my dad as watching the drama with Trisha and Ethan from frenemies was incredibly triggering to me as it was exactly how my mom treated my dad growing up. Which was hard to watch then and even more so now. 

Just recently I called them and they're having a birthday/graduation BBQ for my two younger siblings who graduated High-school this year. We live far away so my wife and I said we'd be happy to rent a car to come see them and celebrate. The first excuse to saying 'no' was to say they had no room. Then when I later suggest my wife and I sleep on the couch because we really wanted to see them, they said they wouldn't allow that because they're still not comfortable with my wife and I sleeping in the same bed. This hurt because 1, we're back to square one in terms of being accepted. 2, they fully lied about the reason for not wanting us to come over and celebrate. 3, they are still refusing to compromise about anything even a year later. I'm really hurting right now as it feels like I'll never be accepted and it is so damaging to my mental health. 

Any advice on what I should do is appreciated. 

TLDR: my parents are super homophobic and uncompromising and I don't know how to have a healthy relationship with them married to a woman."

Can I vent?,danithinks,ainbow,"TW: anger/vengeful thoughts.

I resent my cousins and their discrete homophobia. They were so nice to me before I came out. Once I came out, theyve started avoiding eye contact with me, they dont talk to me anymore, they basically act like I dont exist. And they only save face because were at family gatherings.

When I vent to my mom about this, she just tells me, Maybe they didnt see you. Maybe youre overreacting? Maybe they were busy talking to someone. Its soooo frustrating because I KNOW theyre being jerks on purpose, yet Im the only on experiencing it. I have no allies in my family. 

I just hate that my family is so oblivious to the disrespect. Im fueled with anger. I really dont want these feelings to consume me. Sometimes I wish I could get revenge. I wish I could be as rude to them as they are to me. I wish I could hurt them to their core like theyve hurt me. I never wanna see them or talk to them again, but I know Ill probably see them at more family gatherings. I want to ignore them like they ignore me. 

Im hardly an angry person, but this gets me so riled up. Their ignorance and disrespect angers me enough to bring me out of my compassionate character. I dont want this rage to stay with me. I hope it will go away soon, and that Ill stop thinking about how rude my cousins are to me."

12 year old sister came out to me!!!!,GummiiBearKing,ainbow,So my little sister and I spent the week together at my grandma's because she didn't wanna get on a plane by herself and my dad and his wife couldn't take time off and anyway she told me while shaking that she's been dating a girl for three years  they're adorable. I'm so glad she trusted me to tell me. My dad and stepmom are conservatives so I told my sister she can ask me for anything if she needs anything. are there any kid friendly LGBT meetups or something?
I had been sad for so long after ending my last relationship now Im seeing this super cute guy and I decided to write about our last date.,Juneonredd,ainbow,"I knew that he was gonna go on vacation but I couldnt stop thinking about him and I couldnt wait for him to come back so we could spend some time together again. 

He didnt really say when he was going to be back so I was a little bit nervous about texting him and asking if he wanted to see me. But after talking to and old friend about stuff he told me that life is too short to keep waiting around instead of shooting you shot and pursue someone that you like. I grew up confident and just texted Him. Do you know that sensation when you send a text and just want to throw your phone away? Well, thats what happened to me. He didnt take that long to reply and that was good because i was really worried about bothering him and really nervous about saying the wrong thing. 

He told me about his vacation and I was glad that he had fun and after that I asked if he wanted to do something together, like watching a movie or going for a walk. Oh gosh, I got so excited when he said yes. I have been showing him the kind of music I like and mostly what I listen to. He even gave me a little compliment on my taste in music, how sweet! But I wanted him to show me something that he likes too, so I asked him to find a movie for us, and he got a horror movie. I dont really watch movies because Im more into tv shows but I would  watch land do literally anything with him, hes just so nice and makes me feel very comfy being myself all the time. 

I invited him to come over to my place so we could have a nice time and enjoy the movie. Im used to doing this alone, I enjoy my own company the most, I always take a night for myself and watch my favorite tv show and take care of myself like nobody else could and the idea of doing this with someone who i really like it was just something I always wanted to do, Just being there, existing, next to someone that also feels comfy being with you, it feels good. 

He got here and I was so ready for it. Made sure that everything in my room was in the right place. Im not a messy person but yeah I put a little more effort that night lol and I should mention the snacks, food makes people happy right? I got some snacks, my favorite one was the ice cream and I was somehow conflicted when buying the ice cream because I didnt know if should get two small cups or a bigger one so we could share, I ended up getting the bigger one and I could see us with two little spoons enjoying the ice cream. 

I know I know, my imagination takes me so high sometimes or even to imaginary (happy) places that Im quite sure dont exist. We started with the ice cream, it was delicious. We were sitting next to each other in bed and for a moment he stopped eating and was just holding his spoon like thinking about something. Turns out he wanted to feed me some ice cream, it was the cutest thing ever. Im not going to lie, I really tried to seduce him when he was putting that spoon inside my mouth. I hope that doesnt sound bad because it was nice on my opinion. Then I got some popcorn and I couldnt even open the stupid bag lmao then he looked at me like hey do you need any help little buddy and I gave him the bag and he tried to open it and he couldnt open it either, it was hilarious but I was done so I just got a pair of scissors and cut the bag open. 

He also fed me some popcorn, I think that his hands are so gentle and pretty so I didnt mind him putting some fingers in there hehe. I did the same with him too and I had an idea, knowing that he enjoys getting kissed on the neck I put some popcorn on his collarbone and I just ate that like a little b*tch, I knew it was a good chance to give him little kisses on the neck, because you know I really enjoy some teasing and I could say that it worked, we ate a whole bowl of popcorn together yayy. 

The movie lasts for about 2 hours and if Im being honest I was thinking about how long he could resist to my teasing, we watched the movie for one hour and after that he was asking if we should pause the movie and only took that long because we were busy eating some snacks lol 
I agreed to pausing the movie and just get into it. 

He enjoys making out so much and I like it too cause that gets him hard as a rock hehe and that gives me some kind of power that I cannot explain, Im just like wow hes really into this! And it makes me happy.
He has such a nice body, Im literally daydreaming about him taking his clothes off and just waiting for me to please him, I know what he likes and what he needs to get the highest amount of pleasure possible, I see him as deserving of me so Im always down to give him some pleasure. I dont know if I should be talking about this like worshiping but yeah in that moment, inside my head hes the most deserving creature on the planet and pleasing him becomes the purpose of my whole existence. Damn that really sounds intense but I cant help it! 

He always enjoyed face f*cking me but he had never seen me on my knees while pleasing him so I wanted him to see me that way too, hopefully that created a nice memory for him because it definitely did for me. 
After that we got in bed again and we cuddled, Im such a simp that I even got a playlist with relaxing music for us, I think he enjoys the music as much as I do. We read the song lyrics together and thats just the kind of music I like, something with meaningful lyrics and a good sound. I also wanted to show him something that I had written about Tim(e) - his name is Tim lol- and how much I enjoy the little things or moments in life, and after reading that he asked so you wish you could freeze time right now? And my mind went hell yeah baby I could live in this moment forever 

Ugh hes always asking the right questions and I love that so fucking much. 

He had to go home, it was kinda late and I wished he could have stayed longer but you know it doesnt matter because I always lose track of time when Im with him and a moment with him can become an eternity inside my head if I want to, I mean every time I think about it I am
reliving that moment, I love how powerful our minds can be and I will definitely be thinking about him. And I dont mind telling him that because its nice to have a place inside someones mind and some people make a connection between the mind and the heart like when people say just follow your heart they dont mean to say follow your heartbeat lol so I guess thinking about him and our moments really gives him a place inside my heart. 

I am happy once again and Im ready to share that with someone else so Ill try my best to make him happy because we deserve it."

Despite all of that I still have to let you know I love you I know I wouldn't be able to sleep if I didn't.  I have been putting off talking about my topic tonight because honestly I needed to do some research and I really wasn't sure I would talk about it.  Several of you though have asked me to do a post on how to convince your parents about your sexuality or gender. Let me say my research turned up jack shit really.  There is not a lot of information out there on this.  Honestly you shouldn't have to convince them they're your parents they should love and accept you without question.  I will never understand parents over reacting to their kids coming out.  Unfortunately they do which leaves you wondering how to fix it.  The best option I found is Education it is the best way to help them understand.  They need all the honest facts you can find. Facts are the only way to get through the wall of hate or ignorance they've put up.   They have to get to the point to where they begin to question if they're right or not.  Once they do that you have a chance of convincing them.  A lot of parents however never get to that point they remain close minded and unwilling to change.  I hope your parents are one of the ones who love and accept you no explanation needed.  If they aren't and they're like my parents closeminded unwilling to listen and would rather throw you out or make your life unbearable, im here.  I will accept you and love you unconditionally.

[TW] How do I come out to my family? Should I even consider coming out? (TW: homophobia and some other topics that might cause trigger),AkiliosTheWolf,ainbow,"I'm going to be honest with you, from here now on, the story only goes downhill.

So I come from a very religious catholic apostolic romanian family, my grandmother (my mother's mother) is homophobic and goes to the church frequently (like 2-3 days a week), my mom was raised to also be religious, she doesn't go to church as much (like 10 times an year), but she prays the rosary everyday before sleeping, I'm not religious and I don't pray (like my father, but he is also very conservative and has made homophobic remarks). 

Idk any of my father views other than the comments he has made, but one day he said he would accept me regardless of any choices I made, he said he'd accept me even if I became a liberal and a communist and I'm pretty sure he wasn't joking, my mother on the other hand is a whole other issue, I feel like she doesn't even like me even while thinking I'm straight and I think that would worsen if I come out, she already favorites my brother and she has no issue showing it (I won't go through everything that she has done or said to me because it's way too much stuff, but I'll cover the most important parts) ever since I was a little kid she wanted to control my life, she'd cry if I didn't wear the clothes she wanted (she already made me attend friend's parties in ridiculous attires by guilt tripping me), she blames me for things I didn't do (something about this that stands out was when she said I had changed her phone password one time that she forgot it and made me cry in the middle of the mall (I was 9) and the most recent was when she blamed me for a pen not working (ridiculous, right?)), she used to pick on me with my brother all the time (they said I was found in the middle of the woods and she said only my brother was from the family and that she liked him more (messed up thing to say to your under 10 years old child and I also hate my brother, but he isn't the issue being discussed here)), now to the part where she is homophobic (really hypocrite since her best friend is a lesbian) one day she was talking about a family and she goes ""Wow, must be really hard for them, one of their sons is suicidal and the other one is a (f-word (well, an equivalent to the f-word in our language)"" on many occasions when she gets mad at people making mistakes (specially when people make mistakes while driving) she will call people the f-word, I'm pretty sure she thinks it's a sin and that we're all going to hell and only tries to hide it in front of her friends to look good (by ""supporting"" LGBTQIA+ people and posting stuff like ""love is love"").

I'm pretty sure that if I came out her reaction would be terrible and I'm ready for her to call me a disappointment, despite telling myself that she has already treated me terribly and that I shouldn't care and be hurt if she did, I know I will be hurt, everyone seeks approvals from their parents and as much as I hate to admit it I seek hers too, nobody likes being called a disappointment, much less by their parents, regardless of what they've done to them before and I it's not like we only have bad times, we have good times too (she treats me way better than she did when I was younger and I'd love to have a good relationship with her, but I feel like our relationship has already been damaged beyond repair). How do you think I should come out? Should I even come out?"

&gt;  
&gt;If we push queer representation too much, those people in the GMA audience will never come to the ballet, he speculated.  
&gt;  
&gt;... When he presented a work that featured a clearly romantic duet between two women, including a kiss, some board members opposed the production and then insisted he put a sign in the lobby that the performance was recommended for mature audiences only.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sklute said hed like to have more opportunities for non-heteronormative representation, but he has to balance that against selling tickets.  
&gt;  
&gt;If Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker are our biggest sellers and we need to stay alive, how can we produce them with swapping gender roles? he said.

The lack of gay representation comes down to money. And society revolves around money. Money is necessary for ""survival"". And if someone doesn't have money, then they can not ""survive"". 

Since most people don't want to see gay representation, producers, writers, singers, etc, can not represent anything that is gay, otherwise they'd make no money, their jobs would crash and they'd not be able to ""survive"" in society ... 

Does that make gay representation a ""bad"" thing? Does that mean it's not ""necessary"", because it leads to someone's job crashing and not being able to ""survive"" in society as a result?"

Hey everyone!

I just finished writing my first script!It was strongly inspired bymy own life, so the opinion and reception of the community is very important to me.

It's about a girl dealing with her feelings for her roommate and acknowledging her sexuality; needless to say there are LGBTQ+ themes, along with women of color and minor mentions of religion. The main character identifies as asexualbut gets confused once she starts experiencing sexual desire. There's a non-binary character and a bisexual character as well. It's 20 pages, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback. Particularly about the representation and story.

Thank you so much for your time!

Do I need to have a specific label to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?,QueerBatty,ainbow,"I'm a 24 year old cis man and I've always struggled with severe self-doubt and identity issues because of my trauma and OCD, even with therapy. However, I've always known that I was primarily attracted to men even before the trauma and I now have a boyfriend who I love and care about very much.

I'm not sure if I'm attracted to other genders too, but trying to find and commit to a more specific label for my sexuality has always been an issue because of my trauma and OCD. After trying to chase the ""perfect"" label for years and never finding one that fit me, I eventually gave up on obsessing over my sexuality and settled on queer or unlabeled.

Only problem is that I worry people will take me calling myself queer or unlabeled as an open invitation for people to push labels onto me, which has actually happened before. I've also been told that I shouldn't reclaim queer because of its history as a slur.

So, my question for you all is this: do I need a more specific label to be part of the LGBTQ+ community, even if trying to label myself makes me feel uncomfortable and distressed? Or can I just remain unlabeled and still be part of the community? Thanks in advance for the advice."

All we need is love,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger warning: homophobia and verbal negativity


Hey virtual dad here checking in.  Has anyone told you lately they love you or are proud of you or hey you're doing a great job.  Its a simple act to let people know you care but it has a tremendous impact on our mental wellbeing.  Letting someone know you love them or care about them can brighten their day.  It can lift their spirits and their mood.  When we know someone cares for us it makes us more energetic and caring ourselves.  When someone tells us we're doing a good job or their proud of us the quality of our work improves.  See letting someone know they're loved and important to us makes a big impact yet sadly most of us take it for granted.  We just assume people know how we feel so we don't tell them as often.   We must tell people they are important to us and they are loved.  So many LGBTQ+ kids rarely hear that from their family anymore.  Instead the last thing they hear from them were things like...  I don't know why you let us down like that. You weren't raised to be gay.  You've shamed this family and the list goes on.  Its funny we're the ones being bullied.  We're the ones facing discrimination daily.  We're the ones who struggle yet somehow it becomes about them.  They forget the child they love is still there.  Their sexuality doesn't change that.  They still need your love and pride yet its usually denied.  Just know I love you all.  There's nothing that brings me joy like being here for you.  Yall are awesome just keep being you.  My DM's are open for everyone who needs me."

How to come out,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hi bi dad checking in with all my love and hugs I can give.  Before I tell you what I've got on my mind for tonight I want to share some news.  Im going to be a grandpa im so excited.  I found out today my oldest daughter is pregnant yayyyyy. So I've decided to talk tonight about something I've covered before but I keep getting messages and questions about it so it bears repeating. People are still asking and wanting to know how to come out. Let me say this I do not recommend coming out unless you are sure it is safe to do so. That being said I do have people who insist despite how safe it is they have to come out. So for those of you that it is safe to do so and for those of you who have to come out regardless I'm going to tell you how I recommend doing. For those of you that it is safe to come out you're just not sure what to say or how to say it here's what I recommend. Sit your parents down and have a simple conversation with them. There's no need to try to find a creative way or tip on how to do it.  No need to drop subtle hints the best thing to do is sit them down and be honest with them. If you have supportive understanding parents there's a good chance they already know.  Now have your information prepared because they may have questions so be able to answer why you're coming out why you feel what your sexuality is or gender is and be able to talk knowledgeably to them.  Don't be in a rush give them time to express their thoughts don't interrupt just have a simple conversation about it. To those of you who are not sure if it's safe to do so or you're pretty sure it's not safe to do so but you just have to do it here's what I recommend. First go somewhere public it can be a restaurant it could be coffee shop anywhere just somewhere public that you can talk. The reason for this is it minimizes the chance of them causing a scene in public it also buys you time if you're afraid they're going to throw you out.  This allows you time to get home and regroup. Chances are if you're in public they're not going to overreact and hit you however everybody's different they may. If you believe you may end up homeless after telling them you need to have a plan in place somewhere to go a bag pre-packed some money saved up things like that. If you need to talk to somebody run ideas by them or whatever I am available. My DM are always open to anyone who needs me.

Special delivery! Find a Person?,Wonderful-Welcome-73,ainbow,"I was working on Monday, and as a delivery driver, I have a LOT of time just me and my thoughts...
     I delivered to a house that I am fairly confident the person that answered the door was on some sort of journey, 
(Details withheld due to privacy) It caught me off guard, as I do not see many people, and the ones I do are usually not visibly part of the LGBTQIA+ community...

To that person:
I will not post the address, or any information that identifies location too much! But I wish I had talked a bit to you, you had a rainbow tie-dye top (sports bra?) (I want one) you looked good! I wish I had not been in work mode! This is Wednesday and I am still thinking and wishing I had talked a bit more... At the very least complimented the look and asked about the top, I do not usually get that route, or work Mondays... a one in a million chance...
you have an uphill driveway, I am shorter, I parked down at the bottom of your driveway... I know I technically am not supposed to... and cannot give any details, but if you see this and remember getting a package from a kind of quiet delivery person July 6 2021... You made my day! I hope I delivered a smile as well!
So frustrating to think that I didnt say anything, and have no way to contact you other than a shot in dark on the internet!"

Are the only letters people care about in LGBT really the L and the G?,ArchDukeNemesis,ainbow,"Cause that's what it feels like. Despite a message of inclusiveness and equality, gays and lesbians take the majority of focus. They are at the forefront for the media. They are what the average person thinks of first. The support is for lesbians and gays. Everyone else just gets the support indirectly. Despite being one group, one movement, it doesn't feel very equal. LGBTQ is synonymous with Gay and Lesbian community to most.

I've read more than one story about the lack of acceptance. On how transfolk are not valid, even in the eyes of some LGBT members. On how bisexuals are harassed from both sides, being seen as just 'straight but quirky' or 'looking for a third for a threesome' by the community and being seen as promiscuous by straight folks.  One foot in each world, belonging to neither. Doesn't feel like Asexuality is acknowledged at all. 

At the root of it all, was it right to lump everyone who isn't cis or straight under one banner? Does the one size fits all mentality work? Doesn't it just overgeneralize and trivialize each sub-groups own merits and issues? Is the mutual support and solidarity worth it if each individual community doesn't get the distinct care, focus and recognition they need?  Does giving them all the same treatment really mean treating them all as equals? Would the best thing for all in the long run to be for the LGBTQ movement to be disbanded, and for each variety of gender, sexuality and romance to be treated on it's own and not as part of a spectrum? 

Because lumping everything into the same group because it's not cis or straight sounds rather archaic. 

You're unique. Just like everyone else."

Living in fear,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger Warning: homophobia and hate

Good morning family virtual dad checking in with big hugs and love for everyone.  So I saw a post the other day and I want to spread the message it was talking about. The poster mentioned how they were on a city bus coming home from a pride celebration and they were watching as people took off their stickers and pride makeup because of the area they live in and it reminded them how much work still needs to be done.  That's so very true we have come a long ways but we have far to go still.  I wonder how many were taking off there stuff not just because of the area they live in but because of who they live with.  So many kids live in fear at home of being who they really are.  Fear of being kicked out or treated badly if they come out.  We have to get rid of homophobia in the home if we ever want to get rid of it in the world.  Its sad when kids have to sneak to pride then remove all of their stuff before getting home so their parents don't know they're LGBTQ+. When we still have to hide from our family we haven't come far enough in our fight.  Just know I support you and you can be yourself with me.  My DM's are open if you need to chat im available.

What is happiness,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey good evening virtual dad checking in tonight with big hugs and love. What does happiness look like to you.  For me it was first accepting im bisexual.  Then having a family. Its having a close group of friends and family who love and support me.  Now its hoping to find a partner to spend the rest of my life with cuddling together.  Happiness is different for everyone but one things common for us in LGBTQ+ that is to accept our sexuality and gender ourselves and to be accepted by others.  We can never truly be happy being ourselves if we can't be accepted.  In order to be happy we need to surround ourselves with people who accept us and cut loose those who don't.  We as people tend to hang on to toxic friends and family because its hard to let go and make new friends.  We must however cut toxic people out regardless of how close they were if they cannot contribute to your happiness and support our sexuality and gender.  You deserve to be happy it costs a price but its worth it in the end.  I know this hurts to hear but there are those of you tonight who needed to hear it.  My DM's are open.  I love and support you and hopefully contribute to your happiness.

Love always

Remember,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning hope you're having a good day virtual dad checking in on you reminding you in love you and support you.  So today I want to remind you of 2 things.  

1.  You're sexuality and gender are normal.  Just because we're not hetero does not mean we're abnormal. The fact that LGBTQ used to be considered a mental illness was absurd.  Its funny to parents never tell their kids they're to young to know they're straight because that's seen as normal.  Your only to young to know if you're LGBTQ+ because that's not normal.  You are not to young to know how you feel.  Love is love regardless of who its with.  Its normal to not feel like your agab.  Just because not everyone goes through it doesn't mean its not normal.  There's no normal for everyone.  No one on this planet is exactly like everyone else.  We're all unique.  So yes you're normal.  Society will tell us different and makes us out to be freaks but we're normal there's nothing wrong with us.

2.  What you're feeling is natural.  There's nothing wrong for having feelings for people of different sexes or genders.  The fact the we box love into between male and female is what's not natural.  There's cases in the animal kingdom of homosexuality so if it goes against nature why are they doing it.  Love is a natural feeling and it doesn't know gender and sexuality it only knows intense deep connection.  So society may think we're unnatural and sinful but we're not.  We're just not so close-minded to think love is limited.  Parents need to learn that its a good thing you found someone to love not worry about their sexuality or gender.  

My DM's as always are open to all who need to talk.

I finished a bunch of jewelry. What do you think?,Firefoxcreation,ainbow, 
Can you give me arguments against these homophobic claims?,Loud-Ad4422,ainbow,"There are a few homophobic claims in this post and its comments that I wanted to know if there are any counter-arguments to: https://imgur.com/uS9pmJy 

Claim 1: 

&gt;Gay people are aids, STDs carriers. They are infected with STDs more than any other group. 60% of people infected with aids in usa are gay men, they are 60 times more likely to catch STDs, so it's fine to be disgusted by them. Patient 0 for Aids was a gay man who went bare back with hundreds of partners:  
&gt;  
&gt;Dugas was stated to be a charming, handsome athlete who was very sexual according to his own estimation, averaging hundereds of sex partners a year. He had claimed to have over 2,500 sexual partners across North America since becoming active in 1972.

Claim 2: 

&gt;Gay people have sex the wrong way. Mouth and asshole are not built to have foreign ding-dongs go into them, the mouth is meant for food to go in and the asshole is meant for shit to go out. 

Claim 3: 

&gt;A third of all pedos are gay. ""A significant percentage of pedophile victims are boys (25-33%)."" So when you support gays, you could be accidentally encouraging a pedo.  

Claim 4: 

&gt;Gay Lobby legalizing gay marriage destroyed the institution of marriage. Gay people push their gay agenda and lifestyle down on kids and others. We have really degenerate gay pride parades in every town, every year, with every civic organization marching along in lockstep.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have explicit, pro-gay lessons in schools at the kindergarten level, and drag queen story hour in the local libraries. We have bakeries being put through legal hell if they refuse to bake a gay wedding cake. So much for live and let live.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gay people don't want equality. They want to short-circuit normal people's disgust at their gay practices and make people not find them disgusting.   
&gt;  
&gt;The same techniques are now being used for polygamy, pedophilia, bestiality and incest campaigns waiting in the wings. 

Claim 5: 

&gt;Gay people act upon their so called 'nature' which is not good for them. Just because someone likes kids doesn't mean they can touch kids, same for gay people. There is a difference between having urges and acting upon them. Sometimes women have the nature to monkey branch, but they don't because it is not the right thing to do. 

Claim 6: 

&gt;Before pornstars film a gay scene they don't eat 24hrs before filming and then enema themselves over and over again so there is no shit involved. Can two gay people even have spontaneous sex or do they have to plan their sex days in advance? Or do they not care about shit all over and the smell? 

This one claims gay people can not have ""spontaneous sex"", otherwise ""there'd always be shit involved"". 

Claim 7: 

&gt;Being gay is a mental disorder. In terms of evolutionary beliefs it really would be. Only a man and a woman can be together, anything other than that is a defect or disorder that goes against evolution. It was only removed from the DSM as a political move, not a scientific one. Yet they struggle to explain the obscenely high suicide rate and all of the reported regrets among gay people. They have high suicide rates even in the west, eventhough they are not discriminated against as much. 

This one claims even in places where gay people are not discriminated against as much as the other places, they have higher suicide rates, so ""it must be a mental illness""

Claim 8: 

&gt;Gay people are sick: [https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/satanic-drag-queen-long-beach-library-full-600.png](https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/satanic-drag-queen-long-beach-library-full-600.png)

You see I had an interesting thing happen today its the first time since doing my dad posts I've had it happen and it was just awesome to me.  So I had someone I was talking to ask me if their parent could email me.  They were doing their best to support their child but this was all new and wasn't sure how to proceed.  I absolutely gave them my email.  This is what I've been wanting to see happen.  This child showed their parent some of my posts and it got them to thinking how to better support their kids.  I've had a lot of yall tell me im already more supportive than your parents and you barely know me and that's great its what I want.  My messages have and will always be about helping the LGBTQ+ community and our allies especially our LGBTQ+ youth.  My goal is to be a parent to you if yours absolutely will not accept you but I also want to help your parents do better if they will.  Now Its finally starting to reach past the apps and into people's lives its amazing.  This is all it takes to be a supportive parent reaching out and asking for help.

I recently just had top surgery and I just uploaded a video on my Youtube channel of my recovery from the past week. 

I thought I would share this video here so more trans people have information about the Womens College Hospital and Dr. John Semple. That is where I went for top surgery and the surgeon that did my procedure. 

After I am fully recovered from top surgery, I will be making videos about climate change, educating people on trans topics, LGBT topics and the basics of various mental illnesses. I will also be making gaming videos, videos about my personal life and many more. My dream for years has been to be a Youtuber or a content creator. I am finally taking this seriously and I am trying to get to 1,000 subscribers by the end of the summer! I am so grateful for everyone who has subscribed so far and I cant wait to upload all of these videos I have ideas for

Can't stand this one person in my group.,Rotten_Tobacco_Eater,ainbow,"Before I begin, I should note that I am a gay trans-man who's been out for 12 years and has been active in my LGBT+ group for that long.  Plus I'm already on testosterone. I knew since I was five that I was a boy, and had to deal with haters my whole life.

&amp;#x200B;

This woman in my group is an ugly fat girl with no friends decided to come out as nonbinary. She said she only discovered her identity within the last month. I called bullshit on her, and got a few others to join in with me. She never returned to the meetings, which is good because the LGBT+ doesn't need attention seekers like her. This woman infuriates me because she undermines people who actually feel uncomfortable in their own skin, and I feel proud that I put a stupid cisgender person in their place.

Could you sign a petition to help Australian transgender and gender diverse students?,BMurphy160,ainbow,"The Queensland government is not allowing students to use their preferred names at school. They will only use legal names unless they have permission from both parents. 

Not everyone will have parents that will allow permission for this. When thats the case for transgender students or gender diverse students, teachers will have to either deadname the student or potentially lose their job. 

This also violates the Trans @ School section of the Queensland Human Rights Commission. [PDF can be found here](https://www.qhrc.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/24535/QHRC_TransAtSchool_forschools.pdf)

In summary, for some students, school is their only safe place where they can use their preferred name and pronouns. By signing this petition, you will allow transgender or gender diverse students to use the name they want to.

"Fell in love but not interested in sex, need serious advice, please respond",iamyourdancer,ainbow," I'm too nervous about sex. I'm not comfortable with sex with another when I'm a man,I am NOT interested in sex at all even with straight women, I'm no virgin either, it's just not important to me. I'm bisexual, I've had sex with tons of women, never with men, and right now I'm almost exclusively dating men for years.

My man, we basically kissed, hugged, slept for over 12 hours. But that's it. There was groping and I was fine with that. I'm just not comfortable at all with anything anal. I'd be fine with mutual masturbation but that's it for me, nothing more than there. It was so beautiful, I don't have words to describe it. Like some shit pulled out straight from Disney.

I had to constantly apologize for my ""lack of libido"" and at some point admitted I've never had sex with men before. Dude told me ""dude don't worry I don't want to fuck, if I wanted to fuck you wouldn't even in my place"". This person is 10 years older than me and way more mature and ""veteran gay"" basically while I'm just having my baby steps.

I need help here on how to proceed. Apparently we're going to keep dating and I feel like a teen fanboy girl and I'm almost a 30 grown ass man. **Totally unrelated**, but no other woman has givenme the amount of love and affection another man has given me, all these years, all my life. I'm deeply in love. And it pissess me off people have been killed over things like this."

Speak,WonderFrog25,ainbow,So I got this from u/bi_dad48 most recent post I'm just thanking him. Speaking can be hard and harder it is when talking about your self. I can talk all day about history to any one on this planet I like to learn more to. But when it comes to speaking about ourselves that's when it becomes hard maybe if you talk to some random people they will forget you but than family. Coming out to family or just talking to people you look up to to ask them treat you the way you want to treated be called by any of that now thats hard. So I will say some people won't be accepting some will but be who you are and have no regrets. Do what I do talk to people but don't hide your self from your family be who you are be called by your preferred name by your pronouns. Don't let people stop you from that be yourself. An remember if you need someone to talk to you can talk to me.
Never be ashamed,bi_dad48,ainbow,Hey virtual dad checking in for the night here seeing how yall are doing.  I love each and everyone of you from the bottom of my heart.  So for the 4th of July today the kids and I went to the lake and man it was packed.  Of course everyone else is setting up their patriotic themed umbrella and stuff.  Im putting up our rainbow umbrella and towels.  My bi flag colored bathing suit and painted toes hell we LGBTQ+ the place up.  Well you know me I seem to draw people to me.  I had a family come up to me mom dad teen son and daughter.  The parents wanted to know how i could be so bold as to display all of my stuff.  Its easy I said I fought to hard to get out of the closet to hide who I am for anyone.  They asked if I was afraid since we live in the south of being bullied. I said sure its a possibility but you'd be surprised right here how many LGBTQ+ families there are.  I pointed out a few and they were surprised.  Now they were visiting for the 4th so not from our town but son was gay and daughter was lesbian both were afraid to be themselves until they saw my umbrella.  I assured them they were free to be themselves in our little slice of heaven.  The parents were amazed at how accepting everyone was. I assured them its not always like that in town but here we're ok.  We talked while the kids swam and played their kids both came out this year and they're still learning.  I commended them both for loving and supporting their kids.  Guys understand it took me years to get to the point of being as comfortable and outspoken as I am.  Move at your own pace but never be ashamed of who you are.  My DM's are open to you all feel free to message me.
How do I explain to my date (16 M)'s family that I am Kindergender?,CatboyRuyan,ainbow,"For those who don't know what that is

My date is fine with it, I have yet to meet his family and I am unsure where they sit on LGBT+ (specifically transgender) issues, so I am wondering what is the best way to explain to them that I am Kindergender. Thank you!"

An early study of these risks included one hundred patients seeking SRS, sixty-six of whom had surgery and 34 of whom did not (Meyer and Reter 1979). The operated-upon groups were followed

from the time of surgery, the unoperated-upon group from the time of initial interview at the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins. Of those operated on, twenty-one had a trial period

(taking hormones and working in the opposite-gender role) while the other thirteen had been well-established in the cross-gender role at the time of surgery but did not have a formal

trial period. Follow-up was successful in fifty-two patients, of whom fifty consented to have their data published. Follow-up interviews covered three main areas: adaptation; family

relationships and adaptational patterns at major life intervals; and fantasy, dreams, and sexual activity. 7380 percent of the patients were male. Average follow-up for operated-upon

patients were sixty-two months and twenty-five months for the unoperated-upon group.

In a 2015, Boston study of 180 transsexual youth who had undergone SRS (106 female-to-male; 74 male-to-female), these youth had a twofold to threefold increased risk of psychiatric disorders,  

including depression, anxiety disorder, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, self-harm without lethal intent, and both inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment compared to a 

control group of youth.

The largest study to date of the long-term psychological state of post-SRS persons was an analysis of over three hundred people who had undergone SRS in Sweden over the past thirty years. 

This 2011 study demonstrated that persons after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behavior, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population

In 2014, Dr. Paul McHugh wrote in The Wall Street Journal about this research, Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable non-transgender population.

This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly

challenges the surgery prescription

Mortality rates were 9.6%, with an average age at death of 53.5 years. No significant differences in somatic morbidity or mortality were found between MtF and FtM individuals

""Transgender people have an average life expectancy of about 30 to 32 years,"" Balestra says. ""They don't live any longer; I think that statistic alone says so much.

Weve seen some of the evidence that sex reassignment doesnt produce good outcomes psychosocially. And as McHugh suggested above, part of the reason why is because sex change is impossible 

and it proves not easy nor wise to live in a counterfeit sexual garb.

A US study showed that from 2000 to 2011, the rate of surgical sex reassignment measures among trans persons rose from 72% to 83.9% (7). These data move the question of the effectiveness of 

such operations increasingly into the focus of clinical attention and awareness (8 11).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender)

&amp;#x200B;

either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones. The term is also used more broadly

 to denote a range of identities that do not correspond to established ideas of male and female.

&amp;#x200B;

""a condition that affects people of both genders""

&amp;#x200B;

GRAMMAR

&amp;#x200B;

(in languages such as Latin, French, and German) each of the classes (typically masculine, feminine, common, neuter) of nouns and pronouns distinguished by the different inflections which they have and which they require in words syntactically associated with them. Grammatical gender is only very loosely associated with natural distinctions of sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Gender is the state of being male or female in relation to the social and cultural roles that are considered appropriate for men and women. It is illegal to discriminate on the 

grounds of race, gender, or sexual orientation.

&amp;#x200B;

so it is the same thing according to the dictionary

How do I feel more proud about being gay?,lillezzie,ainbow,"I live with my parents rn and its been 2 years since coming out to them. My family never talks about it and over time it has made me really uncomfortable. Im not the best ambassador for being gay, and still feel a lot of shame from growing up catholic. Recently I visited my grandparents who are both very religious, and they said some borderline homophobic things in conversation with me. I couldnt get myself to come out to them or stick up for the gay community because I dont want to cause trouble. They are both sick and we were visiting for a short time. How do I feel more proud about being gay? It still somehow feels like there will be bad consequences for being myself."

people are beginning to radicalise me and I do not like it at all,dacryonwave,ainbow,"(content warning: feelings of violence, visceral responses to transphobia.)

the more transphobia I encounter in our society -- which is like saying the more saltwater I encounter in the Pacific Ocean -- the more I realise how intractable people are and how unwilling they are even to recognize the humanity of people whose condition they apparently have no power or even desire to understand.  it's also turning me into a person who hates men, which is always been a thing with me giving my past history as a person and my difficult adolescence, but now I'm actually beginning to become uncritically prejudiced against them, particularly cis men, like not even giving them a chance.  and my intellect understands that that isn't an ethical Weltanschauung.

I'm a pretty non-violent person and I don't typically like things like guns but these days I'm really thinking about arming up and I'm getting really fucking furious about how comfortable people are in their hatred.  my contact with their selfishness and evil and solipsism is making me something I don't want to become, and I don't really know what to do about it because even though I cherish peace, I demand justice for myself. the only answer to these people is force; the only response they will ever understand is compulsion.  if anybody ever attacks me, I want to be so savage and brutal that it makes the news and gives these fucks a little bit of pause the next time they think about going out and ""murdering a queer for Christ"".

whenever I see a comment that reveals the deep transphobia that awaits me in our society every day, it just makes me want to go to the range with obvious trans pride gear on with and spend heaps of money getting really really good again at nailing targets from 50, 75, 100m. I used to serve in the military and so sadly I do actually know how to use a weapon, which is weird given my personality of wanting to be peaceful and wanting to foster good relations among people who hail from different kinds of experience.

I also had a big brother figure cruelly butchered outside of the gay club we all used to go to. that was 30 days ago today. he was the only man I trusted when I was 15 years old, and he was an adult gay male attorney who kind of took me under his wing. when he died it shattered my adolescent heart so horribly that my parents had to move us all to Europe because it was basically clocking out of school.  there's even a Wikipedia article about it, one I work hard not to look at each year on July 4th. he was a cisgender gay male.  I miss him terribly and I still struggled with the feelings with which that experience has left me, apparently indelibly.

yeah.

This little 6 year old girl walks up to where me and one of my female coworkers were standing and said my names Mandy I have a ding a ling but one day I'll have a kitty.  Her mom heard the conversation but not in time to stop her.  She apologized telling us her son was trans mtf.  I assured her it was fine because I was LGBTQ+ and had a trans nephew.  She was still adjusting to the idea because it was fairly new only about a year.  She's lost family and friends who think she's cruel letting her be a girl.  I told her its tough cause society just hasn't caught up yet.  Shes a single mom whos husband left before the baby was born.  I gave her my number to have an understanding friend to talk to.  I told her she was a great parent letting her socially transition now so kids at school would never really know.  The girl was just as happy as she could be running and playing.

Im not talking about just your gender and sexuality but the you inside.  Do they know your personality? Do they know your hopes and dreams? Do they know your fears and pain?  Has anyone taken the time to know the real you?  Truth is most of us can count on one hand the people who know the real us.  There's few people we trust enough to let  in that deep.  I think a lot of times its what adds to the fear of coming out.  If we can't trust our parents family and friends enough to show them the real person inside feelings and all, then how can we come out to them.  Truth is most parents don't take the time to earn that level of trust with their kids.  We should be the ones that know the real you.  We should sense when you're hurting or in need.  Yet we brush it off and think they'll come to me if they need me.  No they won't because you haven't earned it.  Parents wonder why they never realized their child was depressed or whatever its because they couldn't trust you enough to let you in.  I love everyone of you and want to help and support you.

&gt;Gary Colwell has summed it up nicely in the abstract to his article on the subject:  
&gt;  
&gt;The charge of homophobia, indiscriminately made in a large part of our Western culture today, is ill conceived, illogical and false. This sweeping charge may be pictured as a triangle of informal logical fallacies. The more prominent side, the one which the general public encounters first, is what I shall call the fallacy of turning the tables: the rhetorical device of making the source of criticism the object of criticism. The other side of the charge is the fallacy of equivocation.  
&gt;  
&gt;The boundary of the term 'homophobia' is made so elastic that it can stretch around, not just phobias, but every kind of rational fear as well; and not just around every kind of fear, but also around every critical posture or idea that anyone may have about the practice of homosexuality. At the base of the charge, and undergirding the other two fallacies, is the fallacy of begging the question. A commitment to the complete acceptability of the practice of homosexuality enables its proponents to 'know' beforehand that all criticisms against it must originate in the defective psychology of the critic.\[5\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The charge that anyone who raises concerns regarding SsSA is homophobic is ad hominem, an attack on the person rather than their argument or concern. It can be likened to a kea-gun\[6\] attack on a person at short range. It shifts the focus from the stated concern to the person raising the concern. Colwell signifies the homophobic argument thus:  
&gt;  
&gt;1- All critics of homosexual practice are homophobic.  
&gt;  
&gt;2 - Being homophobic is bad.  
&gt;  
&gt;3 - All critics of homosexual practice are bad, or 3' What the critics are is bad, or 3"" What the critics have (a phobia) is bad.\[7\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The basis of the argument hinges on Premise 1 being true, which begs the conclusion, and in Premise 2, on how 'homophobic' is defined (sans extensive equivocation). Finally, it is irrational to assert that people who have concerns regarding SsSA or the bio-medical statistics demonstrating significant health risks have a phobia (i.e., an unwarranted fear that paralyses them).\[8\] This fallacy has also been argued against in New Zealand by Robert Mann (1997\[9\]) and Mark Rowley (2001).\[10\]

Don't be boxed in,bi_dad48,ainbow,Good morning everyone virtual dad checking in with lots of hugs and love coming your way.  My kids and I were talking last night and my youngest daughter said a friend of hers told her she's not really bisexual but lesbian.  She said she was told because she likes girls way more than guys she's not truly bisexual.  Here's the thing there is no magic definition you have to fall under to qualify for being any gender or sexuality.  I'm not a big labels kind of guy they're not that important to me.  I know however there are people who need them.  They bring order to them it helps them.  For those who don't care about labels so much here's what I say.  In this example if you're bisexual and that's how you identify that's enough.  Its nobody else's business if its evenly split or offset.  So if someone asks you say im bisexual or say nothing its none of their business.  For those who labels are important you find the label that works for you even if someone tells you you don't completely fit it.  This is your sexuality and gender and if you want to be a bisexual asexual heteroromantic demiboy then you are if that feels right.  Don't let people box in how you feel.  This is your life to live on your terms and no one else's.  As always my DM's remain open for anyone needing to talk.

# Marsha P. Johnson (1945-1992)

Johnson was a gay transvestite, drag queen, sex worker, and gay liberation activist. Her personal mantra was ""Pay It No Mind"". She expressed herself freely without reliance on binary gender stereotypes. Johnson was co-founder of the transgender rights organization, Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries. She also co-hosted STAR House in 1972, the first homeless shelter for transgender and gender nonconforming youth. She also worked as an organizer and marshal with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in the 1980s.

Johnson was an active member of the Gay Liberation Front, which formed on the heels of the Stonewall rebellion. She regularly took part in the Christopher Street Liberation Day marches with friend and colleague Sylvia Rivera, until being barred by organizers in 1973 for crossdressing. In response Johnson and Rivera, led the procession in direct defiance of the orders. She became known as the ""Mayor of Christopher Street"", for her generosity and kindness. Fellow queens would often refer to her as their Drag Mother.

# Leslie Feinberg (1949-2014)

Feinberg was a butch lesbian, transgender rights activist, author, and speaker. Ze published the manifesto ""Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come"" in 1992 and proposed the adoption of the GLBT initialism, to improve visibility of the bisexual and transgender communities. Feinberg is credited with advancing the ""transgender umbrella"", inclusive of all people that defy the ""man-made boundaries of gender"" by invoking ""freedom of gender-self-expression"", thereby celebrating gender diversity beyond the limited framework of assigned biological sex.

In Feinberg's view, there was no singular transgender narrative since any perceived incongruity from the established gender norms and ideals of society placed one at elevated risk of harassment or discrimination, even moreso in combination with homosexuality or bisexuality.

Attractions,WonderFrog25,ainbow,So I was going to do some research on different types of attractions but na I'm going to do something else. So this what I got to say. Being attracted to is not the same for all people some feel it in a sexual way. I'm not part of that group sorry but I'm not. Some people feel it in romantic. I do feel romanticly attracted to all people. An some don't feel either. Some people feel more than those 2. Everyone is different for the type of attractions that they have so no two people are the same. Yes theirs people out their that sexualty and romantic attractions are the same. Theirs people like me who their sexualty and romantic attractions are different so respect everyone for who they are. An remember if you need someone to talk to you can talk to me.

I've Posted this elsewhere but...,Obvious-Button5687,ainbow,"This needs to be said

 

I, am the daughter of two asian parents. I identify as a woman and I am straight, but before you click away... I'm not here to rant about being straight. I'm here to call to attention a story that many of us need to hear. My younger brother is 8 years old. He loves watching shows such as Carmen Sandiego and listens to Olivia Rodrigo with me. He is awesome, sweet, kind, and the best brother I could ask for. However, my parents typically have toxic conversations with me...one of which occurred last night. My mother said ""What show are y'all watching?"" I responded and she goes ""Are there men in that show"" and I say yes but the lead is a female. She then tells my brother to go upstairs and says to me ""You are not allowed to watch that show with him ever again. It's a girls show"". This wasn't the first time I was told this, but I fought back a little. It wasn't my best, but it got me in trouble and my dad yelled at me. When I turn 18, I want to take him with me... but until then I don't know what to do.

This story isn't a way for me to get sympathy. I just want the world to know that it's not okay. Being anti- lqbtq+ is wrong. And I want my brother to grow up in a world where, no matter what he does, he is loved."
Am I genderfluid?,jackieeuwu,ainbow,"Hi besties jackie here. And im here to adress my confusion. 
When i was little, I never was really interested in indian women traditional wear as of i remember. I usually just wore it cuz i was told to; and the mini me was just too innocent etc. And i also vividly remember asking my mum about why i sounded like a boy(?) Because i felt and i still do feel like my voice sounds like that sometimes, But its just how im built yk its not like ion like it or anything. And its not all th time that it sounds like that yk. 

Fast forward to 8th grade, I changed my appearance whilst trauma from a ~bad~ Family and surrounding. I never let my hair down, wore make up, nailpolish, girly clothes etc. I didn't find it too weird or anything, i just went on with it. 
I wore all blacks, hair in a messy bun, hoods, baseball caps etc. Ppl surrounding me just thought im lazy n dumn to dress like a girl (i live in a very stereotypical environment but it got a little better nowadays). 
My mom always used to question me n all cuz she hated the way i dressed, sat at home, talked, behaved n all.. ""Why are you acting like a dude? Act girly! You're a girl"" She would say. But i din know whr i was going wrong cuz i felt normal and neutral. 

Fast forward to 2021, Im bouta finish school, and very much confused about my gender. 
I never gave too much thought about it cuz half my life has been a disaster and ive gone thru so much that i never came to think bou it. My bestfriend told me that they're a demigirl and now THAT finally made me think ""What am i?"".
Its not just a trend. No ion wanna ""copy"" anyone cuz of the ""aesthetic"". I genuinely wanna know now. Ion act all masculine, but also not all feminine. I mostly wear eyeliner n nailpolish with a blue hoodie,septum and lip ring, shorts and men's shoes. And my mum has gotten used to it now so its okay(kinda). 
But pertaining to my personality, Its all elastic and easy flowing to me on the basis of bein masculine and feminine; More likely to be neutral. 

So today i spent a whole day taking gender tests etc etc, Askin my friends about how i act n all.. 
"" You give off both goth girl that could choke you to death with chains at anytime plus catboy uwu vibes"" said my bestie when i asked him ""How do i act normally""
And tbh, HE'S RIGHT TF?!. 
My mom still asks me why i act masculine at times n all that n tbh im just fine with it.
(oh im an afab btw) 

So now that y'all have read it all, What do y'all think my gender is?. Help me out im confused T_T ."

Stop thinking about it so much,TheClosetIsDark333,ainbow,"As someone who has struggled with my sexuality my whole life, one of the worst things I did was trying to justify myself...to myself.
You can think about it and come up with reason and logic and fit it into nice little boxes and categories but, you are still just trying to cover it as if you are committing crime. I understand why we do this of course. In fact some places it is a crime but I'm talking about in your mind.
Stop with the justification because in a way it's an internal admission of guilt. I don't justify why I drink water every day, I don't justify breathing air, why justify sexuality? 
If you are past the point of understanding why its not wrong then stop constantly trying to remind yourself. Those very thoughts in turn keep the negativity or even oppression alive inside you on a subconscious level and it pops up every time you are just being you in the present moment.
If there are people in your life constantly reminding you, then that is an external issue that dosen't concern you. Your mind is the only thing that is yours alone, don't let others control it. 
Be who ever it is you feel in the moment without judgment because that's part of the human experience.
If you want a new perspective then realize that you are in a unique point of view where you can experience love and affection in ways not everyone has the privilege of experiencing.
Yes it's harder in many ways but the struggle doesn't define you, it's the richness of the experience and you should live it, not judge it."

How do I convince my friend that Chick-Fil-A's ceo is actually supporting anti LGBT causes and how thats harmful,Reasonable_Hall_2148,ainbow,"Hey, I'm working on convincing my friend that the Chick-Fil-A's ceo is actually supporting anti LGBT causes.

Let's start with the the recent daily beast article, [https://www.thedailybeast.com/christian-billionaires-are-funding-a-push-to-kill-the-equality-act](https://www.thedailybeast.com/christian-billionaires-are-funding-a-push-to-kill-the-equality-act) , which says Dan Cathy is listed as a high level donor to Nation Christian Fund that in-turn supports the Alliance Defending Freedom which has a legal history of defending anti-lgbt causes/lawsuits/people.

According to 990 tax filings, the Dan and Rhonda Cathy Foundation donated $5,750 to the NCF in 2018, 2017, and 2016, the most recent years the filings are available.

My friends main points are that The Daily Beast needs to prove that Dan Cathy is STILL donating and even though tax history from 2018-2016 is there, there are only anonymous sources that say Dan Cathy is currently a high level donor to the NCF.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; To get me to not eat at Chick Fil A:  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; 1.) CEO is actually donating to some orgs  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; 2.) Orgs are actually causing harm to people  
&gt;

Family,WonderFrog25,ainbow," So first I have to switch todays and tomorrow's posts so that does nothing but hey just like to inform. So family, family is something that all of us want. We want to feel loved and respected by people we look eye to eye with or even look up to. Some people would be like same sex couples should not have kids well some same sex couples want kids and youcan have kids. But to those people that dont want kids I'm with you on that. It's not because I hate kids, it's that I don't feel like I would be the best person to take care of them. But to all of us that just want a family partner, are parents happy to see us happy, are grandparents respecting who we are, and even those friends that respect us you can be part of someone's family. Family isn't just about biology, it's about who you trust. Who is it that you know and look up to. Who do you consider to be part of your family. Someone you can go to for protection from those that harm you. From the elements. And if you need someone to talk to, I'm here to talk."

Not societies standard,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good day virtual dad checking in seeing how my family is doing.  I received flack from posting same post on multiple subs.  I do that to reach everyone.  Not everybody uses same subs so I maximize my outreach.  Now my nephew and I were talking last night he was a little down.  He said he felt like he didn't pass as a girl(btw I think he's MTF but hasn't come out yet so per his request he's still my nephew) when he dresses feminine.  Now this advice is great for my trans family but works for everyone.  Society has a standard of feminine look and masculine look and hell a standard for everything, and if your trans you bust your ass trying to obtain it.  I will let you in on a secret very few people cis or trans ever achieve it.  So don't focus on unrealistic standards.  I told him his goal was to see a female when he looks in the mirror for others of you see a man etc. Enby not leaving you out your goal look in the mirror and make everyone have to ask.  He wants to be able to go out and everyone think he's a girl.  I told him it takes time and practice be patient.  Society wants us to think of your trans men or women you should be model perfect.  If your trans I know dysphoria already runs wild and you want to minimize it now society wants you a certain size and height etc.    Each day try to be the person you want just a little more if you're a trans woman and your 6ft or taller you're still feminine don't get boxed into false standards.  Now I said this applies to everyone if you're not trans look at in terms of your sexuality.  There is no level of bi or pan or lesbian or gay or trans or ace or etc.  Truth be told im probably more pan because im not attracted to gender but i use bi because its what im more comfortable with.  You can like whatever percentage you want to and still be bi.  Point is if you try to meet societies standard on anything you will fall short.  Find your place that's comfortable to you and then own it."

Though their main focus may be ""fictional lesbians"" being ""converted"", they say in the server that ""real life stories are welcome"", and so they have a channel specifically for ""real life lesbians getting converted/d\*cked"" as you can see in the screenshots.

Even if I hadn't i'd have guessed it was him because anyone with eyes can tell he likes my brother with how he looks at him. Ultimately my brother end up thinking it was this guy he recently had met, a total complete tool. When he talked to the tool guy about this he actually went with it and took the credit for it so proof he's a tool. I talked to my best friend about it cause he was super down and he said he isn't going to tell him it was him, that if my brother wants this guy and is happy with him thats what counts. Except my brother only likes this guy cause he thinks he's super sweet for all the letters, poems, gifts that he left for him when he didn't in fact do any of those things. I've talked to my brother and he's literally mentioned wishing the tool was more openly sensitive like his letters were.

My best friend even put together a prom themed birthday for my brother cause he knows how sad he was about not getting to have his. My friend plans on taking zero credit for the party and even wants to tell him it was my idea when it was not. I know I shouldn't meddle but seriously it's getting hard not telling my brother the truth about this. Is it ok to meddle given the situation and by meddle I mean tell my brother the truth?"

You're not too young,bi_dad48,ainbow,Good morning virtual dad checking and reminding you how special you are and you are loved.  My kids and I were talking yesterday and my niece shes 14 was asking why her parents when she came out kept telling her shes too young to know.  She said its odd but i knew when I was 8 how can I be too young.  I told her its confusing to me why parents do that.  If you had went to them and was telling about a boy you were interested in they would have been like oh who is he is he cute etc.  The minute though you came out as lesbian and interested in a girl you're too young.  I've never understood how you're too young to know you're LGBTQ+ but not to young to be straight.  People especially parents say they want is to keep LGBTQ+ away from kids until they're older.  Kids are coming out on they're own.  They aren't influenced by the community anymore than they are by Calvin Klein underwear and perfume commercial.  They need to be educated so they proceed safely just like hetero kids.  Kids listen your parents will tell you anything to try and keep you from coming out but being too young its the most common followed closely by its a phase.  Look you know your feelings yes sexuality and gender are fluid and could change as you grow.  As parents though we should be guiding you through it not criticizing your choice.  We should be providing you with a space to be free to grow and discover yourself not discourage you.  I know more of you live in situations where you're discouraged and afraid to come out.  That's why im here to be the parent you can talk to about this.  My DM'S are open please talk to me if you need anything.

A lot of people in the LGBTQ+ community have felt confusion or doubt especially younger members.  Its hard to deal with these feelings because for years we've told they're not normal. So now here you are part of the community and its ok to wonder what if im wrong or what if actually gay instead of bi or whatever.  Its ok to wonder what if my parents were right maybe this is a phase or maybe im not valid my sexuality has changed 3 times whatever.  All of your feelings from who you're attracted to all the way to the doubt you feel sometimes is valid. For Decades we hid our feelings trying to be "" normal"" when in reality we were normal.  My nephew tonight was thinking if he just said he wasn't bi any more he could go home.  That's true but he really is bi and trying to hide something like that just eats at you until you can't deny it.  So don't worry everything you're going through is normal.  Its ok to question things and its ok to ask for help to those questions.  That's where I come in.  I am here to help you anyway I can understand what's going on.  You don't have to do it alone.  My DM'S are open for anyone."

Names and Pronouns,WonderFrog25,ainbow,So frist I disliked that one I was going to do. So I reworte everything to sound better. Okay so her we go. Names and Pronouns are very important to most people. So please respect all names and Pronouns. But sometimes they can be hard to get into are mind. So what I'm going to say is the way I train my brain to get the right pronouns. So frist you need to learn the persons pronouns. Next use their pronouns when talking with them and talking with others. If someone messes up on their pronouns tell them it will help you remember their pronouns. If you make a mistake when talking with them say sorry and repeat what you where saying with their right pronouns. If you do this it will help stop making mistakes about the persons pronouns. This could not work for all people but it helps me and for names do the same thing. An remember if you need someone to talk to you can talk to me.
Pride ain't over,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Good morning virtual dad checking in on this lazy Sunday funday.  June is almost over and everyone seems sad because pride month will be over.  Listen don't be sad pride isn't over just because June is ending.  Pride is every day its who we are.  Pride is discovering your gender or sexuality and everything making sense.  Pride is getting equality we so deserve because we have fought for so long.  Pride is being called your proper pronouns.  Pride is being properly gendered in public.  Pride is breaking down gender norms and expressing yourself how you feel most comfortable.  Pride is being able to love who you love.  Just because the parades and celebrations are over doesn't mean pride ends.  Pride is inside all of us to keep celebrating ourselves.  Our individual accomplishments our coming out when we're ready our first date and first love as our true selves.  Pride isn't over its just beginning.  My DM'S are open if you need me

Remember I love each and every one of you

I came out to my girlfriend a week before we got together and also to my two best friends but don't know how to tell my family. I am almost sure that they would be fine and accepting but I am quite an introverted person so I am very nervous. **Does anyone have any advice on how to come out?**
Love,WonderFrog25,ainbow,"Love is something that we all feel in different ways. The way I feel love is being with someone having fun, cuddling, and changing each other for the better. That's what I need but what do you need. So people are like me and not looking for sexual relationship. Some are. Nobody can control who you should be because we are all different we all have different needs. So don't let people tell you who can or can't love. Love the way you can love. Love who you want to love. An remember if you just need someone to talk to talk with me."
Evening check in,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hey virtual dad checking in for the evening letting you know as always you are valid and you are loved.  Well we are back from the lake earlier than expected(damn thunderstorms) but it was a good day.  The family we ran into at the park met us at the lake.  I introduced them to a few LGBTQ+ people I knew there so they knew some more friends in the community.  We swam talked and lounged around their daughters and the other kids had a ball.  The trans girl wore her a bikini for the first time.  Mom and dad were nervous afraid people might could tell but she insisted on wearing it.  Im glad she did you should have seen the joy on her face swimming and playing with the other girls and not one person questioned if she was a girl or not.  Now we have our share of redneck people there but they stayed to themselves and didn't bother us.  This child was so happy all because her parents gave her a safe place to be herself.  I wish all parents could have seen her joy that's what its all about her realizing yes she is a girl.  Sadly not all parents will be like that for those of you who's parents fail im here.  My DM'S are open you can message me about anything.

I acknowledge that you may see this crossposted in other semi-relevant groups. I hope this will help me increase visibility &amp; engagement because I know I should have dropped my project here on Reddit a while ago. I know I've been inactive-ish in general, but I wanted to jump back here for two important reasons:

1. I started a grassroots group earlier this month! Currently, we demand change from political leaders to hold businesses accountable for failing at their corporate social responsibility, especially regarding enabling abuse to the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. As a trans woman, I have continually been on the receiving end of online abuse &amp; cybercrime since last September, at least by what I've visibly shared because it's something that I've experienced my whole life. This experience starts from a local radio station failing at their public commitment to allyship. I invite you to add your voice to make it known that you agree that responsibility for safer &amp; stronger communities starts from up top! [https://act.newmode.net/action/hirewheller/csr](https://act.newmode.net/action/hirewheller/csr)
2. I was on Instagram Live last night to discuss my lived experience as a trans woman &amp; it went great! There are still many questions to answer, so we're going to make it a regular occurrence! The plan is to do it Sundays at 6 pm (CT) starting July 4th, and maybe one sometime during this week so there not so long of a wait! Follow my group's IG so you can stay updated on upcoming episodes &amp; ask your questions for me to answer too! [https://www.instagram.com/hirewheller/](https://www.instagram.com/hirewheller/)"
Good energy today,bi_dad48,ainbow,Ok feel good story Im so full of good energy right now.  So we're at a local park today just having a picnic with the kids before going to the lake.  I have a sticker on my car that's rainbow hang 10 sign.  This family comes up to us with 2 kids 12 and 10 mom and dad.  Mom apologizes for interrupting us but the 12 year old saw my sticker and wanted to talk.  She was trans mtf and bi and wanted to know if that sticker meant I was part of LGBTQ+ community.  I said it did and told her where I got it.  Turns out they're new to the area and hadn't met anyone else LGBTQ yet.  I told her we were all in here in my group part of community and she loved it.  I talked to the parents awhile and asked if they had plans rest of they day they did not.  We're all on our way to the lake now im gonna introduce them to some more folks in the community.  Yes my sticker is subtle because of my job but it gets the job done.  Virtual dad is on cloud nine right now but DM'S are still open for all who need me.

I need to vent cause this is really messing with me and I guess I just am hoping for support 

So yesterday I had some very negative interactions. I had people telling me my gender identity (non-binary) is not valid because theres only two kinds of genitalia. I pointed out that theres science to back up that gender is a spectrum. So anyways I gave up trying to educate them and proceeded to vent on my personal page. My friend commented the following

 Not to be a stick in the mud and Im not trying to start no arguments but at this point in time nobody cares they are gonna do what they want and are gonna say what they want as someone apart of of the lgbt. Just let them f***ing talk cause with all of us posting its not gonna do anything. But seriously if yall
Simply just show these people yall dont care about what they think that will simply Eliminate all the hate it not that hard it is very simple and I mean this in most respectful way but yall complaining and posting isnt gonna do nothing but create more drama for the youth that are trying to come out 

and then followed up with 

cause they know they will get reactions so now with that being said imma just head out and let yall handle this the more yall give reaction the more people are gonna do it we have pro-lgbt president let him handle it he has so much in hand for us if yall will just be patient and let ignorance be ignorance by itself and show people that it dont bother you I kid you not it will end cause the las thing we need rn is more hate and more youth not being able to express themselves in the near future 

she then made a post on her own page saying 

Since I see this subject pop up a lot on Facebook The lgbt community is getting out of hand. Like dont get me wrong Im bisexual in all but yall sitting complaining and posting well I guess theres no such thing as intersex people or I guess there is no such thing as transgenders and whatever else yall be saying. Imma say this and leave the subject alone altogether. But yes Im Bi I date males and females but what yall are doing way to much like people were raised a certain way so certain things there were never introduce to certain things. The same way yall dont like people forcing religion on you is the same way people feel when you push your sexuality on to them. Like yall are gonna make it super hard for the next generation of youth to come out because yall are so arrogant and selfish like yes pride month is to help some people come out of there dark closet and actually show who they are but right now yall are created so much hate for yourselves and its sad like Im not homophobic or anything but yall need to stop letting things get to yall and then want to go and post about and try to make a movement out of it we are not no more important then the next. But now I shall leave this topic alone 

so basically saying Im being an arrogant selfish for venting on my personal page about hate I got for my gender identity..."

"Government, it's time for a new trans law! ( Petition in Sweden)",____0w0____,ainbow, 
AITA for not telling dad about long-term gay relationship,No_Lawfulness_8766,ainbow,"Hi. So I grew up in a tiny, poor mainland Europe town and come from a very homophobic family. Growing up, I always heard my parents and relatives say extremely homophobic things whenever the gay rights top was mentioned. 
I am 27 years of age and I'm in a 6-year long term gay relationship. I'm out to everyone except my dad. My mom took her time but she's totally fine with it now. However, given my mom and dad are still together, my mom told me not to tell my dad as he'll never be ready for it and can result in a divorce and other bad situations.
Keeping this from someone I talk to almost every day has been so taxing on a mental level. On one hand, I want to come clean for my own sake and on the other hand I can't tell him as he would seriously lose it with me and my mom.
Anyone who's been in a similar situation?"
"The word ""identify""",Clay_teapod,ainbow,"Let's take about the word ""identify"", it's a word commonly use when referring to sexuality, most often gender of someone, often oneself.  

Example:  -I was born male, but I **identify** as woman-

Now let's talk about why I hate it.

Let's start by dissecting the example I just gave, -I was born male- for starters, this is incredibly wrong.  All trans women are women, they were born women, they weren't ""born male"" They were born with a cock and balls, which is not ""male genitalia"" as proven by transfems that choose not to undergo bottom surgery. Yeah, some women have penis, get over it. 

""Now that's simple!"", you might be saying, ""Just remove the -I was born male- part!"". Very well, let's see what our sentence looks like now.

:  -I identify as a woman-

Now you might've already notice this, but the sentence is virtually the same as it was before, by using the word ""identify"" you are encouraging the thought that you aren't 'trully' female, you simple 'identify' as such, much like a little kid would identify with the overly charismatic main characters of kid show, while obviously not really being them. 

If you are a trans woman, you do not 'identify' as such, you **are** a woman.

People don't identify as a certain gender, they are that gender.

And why the fuck should their psychical body influence any of that?

Using the word ""identify"" is an instinct reaction from a mentally that we are tied to all the silly rules society attached to our genitalia, while that shouldn't be the case.

Gender has nothing to do with your body, be the gender you trully are and not what the doctors decided when looking in between your legs.

TL;DR: discard all unnecessary meaning attached to your flesh prision"

What I cannot tolerate and will not tolerate is homophobia, racism, and anyone saying slurs to anyone else especially kids.  I stopped at the grocery store in the way to pick up a few things.  I saw this boy maybe 10 running to his dad with flowers in his hands.  When he gets to dad I hear lets get these for mom.  He turns sees the flowers slap's them out of this boys hands and says "" don't you ever grab flowers again ain't no son of mine a queer or ever gonna be one"".  Well you know this daddy can't stand by and not do something so I stopped him and talked to him.  I told him his homophobic attitude was going to cause his son to grow up and hate him.  Then tried to explain unsuccessfully that you're born gay or bi or lesbian etc.  He wouldn't accept it.  I feel sorry for that poor child.  His dads filling him so full of hate.

The race preferences,money11511,ainbow, I like to think of myself as average but I feel like no one wants to even bother talking to me because they can see Im Indian.

Overcoming my own internalized biphobia,codelee,ainbow,"I've recently started to come out publicly as bisexual and polyamorous. It's been quite an intense experience because I was raised very religious growing up, and many people I know are still very Christian. A lot of what was taught to me about bisexuality (and other LGBTQ+ issues) growing up, I've internalized. It's made it really hard for me to feel comfortable dating women. It's taken a lot of work over the last year or so, but I'm finally working on unlearning.

If you want to read more about it, please check out my article: [https://kayleemoser.medium.com/overcoming-internalized-biphobia-39f594fb321f](https://kayleemoser.medium.com/overcoming-internalized-biphobia-39f594fb321f)

Environment to grow,bi_dad48,ainbow,"So my kids and I were talking the other day (shocking I know kids who actually talk to parents amazing what the right environment will do) just about general things going on in their lives.  They come to me about any and everything you can think of.  They know i will give them honest answers even if its I don't know I will research it.  They asked if that's what I provide to the LGBTQ+ community here. That's exactly what im trying to provide.  A safe place where you have people not just me that are virtual parents to help guide you through when your real parents fail.  Do I have all the answers no but i can try to find them.  My advice I give is as a parent not a therapist because im not one.  I told my kids my goal is to show them the love and acceptance a parent should give when a child comes out just like I did for my niece and nephew and y'all that's from the heart that's what I want to do.  My DM'S are open, now I live in the eastern USA so my time zone maybe different than yours but i will respond when I can to each and every message.  You're loved each and every one of you.

I just had my top surgery consultation at the Womens College Hospital with Dr. John Semple! It went really well and I thought I would share my experience here! It was really difficult for me to find information on Dr. John Semple and top surgery results from the Womens College Hospital. I thought I would share my experience here for people in the future who are wanting more information on top surgery at the Womens College Hospital and Dr. John Semple as well. 

In this video, I talk about

1. How I Got My Consultation Date

2. What I Did To Prepare For The Consultation

3. What Happened At The Consultation

4. Going Through What They Gave Me

5. What I Bought For Top Surgery

I will also be making videos about the questions I asked during my consultation and going through the surgery pamphlet and booklet in detail so I can give as much information as possible to other trans individuals needing it. 

I hope you guys like the video and want to subscribe to my YouTube channel! I will be making more trans content in the future and a bunch of other content that I am really excited about!

Am I a gay / bisexual person in denial?,sweet-n-sour_irl,ainbow," Now, I don't know if I'm pulling a Neil Patrick Harris, but all my life I've been attracted to women, tried to get with them, lust, love and all that. But I act...gay. Not in a shallow, surface-level kind of way, but like there's a message deep in my core that expresses itself constantly in my shadow. These changes have been happening since I was maybe 13-14 years old. I am now 18.

1. I know this does not = gay, but I've always talked in a bit of a higher-pitched voice when I started being different in this way. It's not my default voice, I have a deep voice, but my body just naturally kind of shifts it up a few notches in a flamboyant way. I'll listen to my voice back sometimes and I'm like ""is that how I sound?""
2. I'm always complimenting men and it always feels more comfortable to compliment men than women. I have always been subtly or directly pointing out handsomeness or nice features about guys, that I like. I play a lot of video games and watch a lot of TV and I'll see a guy who's handsome come on, and while I don't really get any fantasies coming on, I'll be like ""sheeesh this man's got it"". And it just feels so right and less embarrassing than trying to do the same to a woman I see on TV / video games. I'll always talk about how handsome men in my life are (in a subtle, charming, buddy-buddy way), like ""aahh, you rascal, so handsome, get outta here"". And I'll speak the same about fictional characters on TV or video games, to others.
3. I've been interested in gay porn since the age this started happening. But it's not what I primarily watch, it's usually a backup at this point if I don't feel like watching straight stuff. I've got my types, and every other dude I just kinda get repulsed by or have a disinterest. This may be by a kind of homophobia I have internalized. Maybe that's what's causing me to repress any possible homosexuality / bisexuality. But I guess it can't be completely silenced in that sense.
4. When I fantasize about having a boyfriend or sexual relations with a man, it feels so right, so warm (metaphorically) and peaceful. Like it's what I really want, but I just deny myself that fact internally. It feels like a metaphorical world I deny myself out of some kind of subtle, internalized fear for no reason.
5. I noticed a few months ago, when I started openly accepting within myself that's it's okay to be gay, that my mind was a lot more open to feeling romantic / sexual over men than I was before I tried that. I've since put that on pause, by default, but...idk.

Opposition:

1. I can be homophobic. I know that statement's not going to get love here, and I apologize, as I recognize your ways of life, but I guess I'm just not a loud-supporter, and can sometimes be mean to people who are loud, proud supporters, as I find them annoying.
2. I have denied I'm gay or have any gay attraction whenever anybody has inquired. But at this point, I know that's a flat-out lie in a way.
3. Whenever I see a male celebrity that I did my usual ""ah, so handsome"" type talk about, imagining a sexual relationship with them feels weird. It's like...imagining a family member in a sexual situation in that sense (lol sorry for that image), you just kind of repulse from it. BUT if I imagine pretty much a blank slate type person in my mind, and engage sexually with them, I like it and don't push away at all. For example, I am always complimenting and calling Pedro Pascal so handsome and watching videos of him being cute (I like his ""space song"" cry-acting one), but imaging the thought of seeing images of him nude or having a sexual relationship with him is something I back away from mentally and emotionally. Idk why.

My family sees me as possibly gay / bisexual because of #2 alone, but I deny it. They have no issue with homosexuality, but they see indicators I just let off. I don't blame them for that fact, but even I can't clearly identify it.

Some of you will tell me to try it with a guy and see, but the issue is I'm not in a spot in my life where social interaction is very possible. I'm not a loner weirdo or anything, I just don't get out much, and have some anxiety. Plus, I'm limited in outside transportation atm.

Anyway, with all of that awkwardness pushed aside, what could be my problem?"

I'll listen to my voice back sometimes and I'm like ""is that how I sound?""
2. I'm always complimenting men and it always feels more comfortable to compliment men than women. I have always been subtly or directly pointing out handsomeness or nice features about guys, that I like. I play a lot of video games and watch a lot of TV and I'll see a guy who's handsome come on, and while I don't really get any fantasies coming on, I'll be like ""sheeesh this man's got it"". And it just feels so right and less embarrassing than trying to do the same to a woman I see on TV / video games. I'll always talk about how handsome men in my life are (in a subtle, charming, buddy-buddy way), like ""aahh, you rascal, so handsome, get outta here"". And I'll speak the same about fictional characters on TV or video games, to others.
3. I've been interested in gay porn since the age this started happening. But it's not what I primarily watch, it's usually a backup at this point if I don't feel like watching straight stuff. I've got my types, and every other dude I just kinda get repulsed by or have a disinterest. This may be by a kind of homophobia I have internalized. Maybe that's what's causing me to repress any possible homosexuality / bisexuality. But I guess it can't be completely silenced in that sense.
4. When I fantasize about having a boyfriend or sexual relations with a man, it feels so right, so warm (metaphorically) and peaceful. Like it's what I really want, but I just deny myself that fact internally. It feels like a metaphorical world I deny myself out of some kind of subtle, internalized fear for no reason.
5. I noticed a few months ago, when I started openly accepting within myself that's it's okay to be gay, that my mind was a lot more open to feeling romantic / sexual over men than I was before I tried that. I've since put that on pause, by default, but...idk.

Opposition:

1. I can be homophobic. I know that statement's not going to get love here, and I apologize, as I recognize your ways of life, but I guess I'm just not a loud-supporter, and can sometimes be mean to people who are loud, proud supporters, as I find them annoying.
2. I have denied I'm gay or have any gay attraction whenever anybody has inquired. But at this point, I know that's a flat-out lie in a way.

My family sees me as possibly gay / bisexual because of #2 alone, but I deny it. They have no issue with homosexuality, but they see indicators I just let off. I don't blame them for that fact, but even I can't clearly identify it.

Some of you will tell me to try it with a guy and see, but the issue is I'm not in a spot in my life where social interaction is very possible. I'm not a loner weirdo or anything, I just don't get out much, and have some anxiety. Plus, I'm limited in outside transportation atm.

Anyway, with all of that awkwardness pushed aside, what could be my problem?"

Their car had pride stickers and license plate covers and tags.  In window paint they had written we are proud parents of a gay son and pan daughter.  They had rainbow car flags was it tacky sure but they wanted them world to know they were proud of their kids.  They were talking about it to anyone willing to listen.  Their son is 14 daughter is 16 and both came out last year.  Their parents were already allies helping with GSA at the high school.  I talked to the parents and kids for a bit and really enjoyed their energy and enthusiasm.  Their kids knew when they were ready to come out they could because the proper environment had been provided for them.  These kids were happy well adjusted seemed to have no anxiety or depression and yes I know you can't tell by looking.  Parents kids have enough every day stress with school, bullies, exams, homework, sports, after school activities etc. they don't need the added stress if worrying about coming out.  Provide your kids with the tools they need to succeed then let them grow and do it.  For those of you with parents that don't do that my DM'S are open I am willing to help if I can."

Gender in clothing ?,bi_dad48,ainbow,So I rode by a local pride event today and saw a sign that said your clothes don't know your gender.  That got me thinking how programmed we are too gender label things.  Why is a boys shirt or a girls shirt.  Why is it a boys team or a girls team.  Why because its what we were taught.  I was so used to shopping with my girls going into the Jr girls department without thinking about it.  It took my nephew moving in with us to break that programming.  He likes the more feminine style of what's labeled girls clothing.  He gets told all the time in stores where the men's department is.  People don't think about how That fabric in jeans is same whether male or female is wearing it it doesn't change.  Yes I know they're cut different and sized different and you have to work to get right size etc. but in general there's no difference.  Underwear a different story because they're made with genitals in mind so they fit different but otherwise clothes have no gender.  If your in a store looking at a t shirt the only way to know its female is by the department its in.  So throw gender norms out the window.  Wear and dress how you feel most comfortable if you can.  Guys paint your nails wear makeup and dresses or thigh highs whatever.  Wear your hair long short multicolored whatever.  Girls wear jeans or boots or boys shorts let your body hair grow if you want cut your hair short whatever.  Find your style and rock it regardless of what society thinks.  Its your time to shine.  Parents don't be so close minded let your kids explore who they are or want to be.  Love them help them let them grow their wings.

Hate in the LGBT community,imeffingconfused,ainbow,"Hello everyone.

I know that this is going to be controversial, but I need to get it off my chest. Recently, I noticed how hateful the online LGBT community (Including this subreddit) can be. Today, I saw an article posted on this subreddit about a pastor who put a hidden camera in a church restroom. In the comments I saw a person saying that ""Christians should be banned from Earth"" and a bunch of different, even more hateful comments and replies. I know that what the pastor did was really wrong and I know that there are some terrible and hateful people that are Christian, some of them use their religion as a reason to spread hate, but these people are just a small fraction of Christianity. There are bad people in every demographic group, even in the LGBT community, but It's not a reason to spread hate towards them. It's what TERFs do, It's what the alt-right does. They all use what one person, that just happens to belong to a specific demographic group, did as a reason to spread hate towards the whole group. I'm saddened that some people in the LGBT community can be so hateful. It's not ok to equate Christians to Nazis. It's not ok to say that they have ""dogshit beliefs"", just because you don't agree with them. It's not ok to say that they should be banished. It's not ok to call them stupid because they believe in something you don't, and it's not ok to demonize them. Don't say things about others that you wouldn't want to be said about you. What most of us, LGBT people, experience on a daily basis should show why hate is a bad thing. It's not okay to spread hate towards anyone. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect.

To clarify, I'm not saying that everyone here is hateful, but it really saddens me, how many people here think that hate is ok."

Why come out again,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger warning: homophobia and unwilling parents


I have seen and read a few posts about coming out again.  Mainly saying that parents are acting like they didn't come out won't use pronouns they like or proper name now etc.  In my opinion you don't owe anybody another coming out unless your sexuality or gender has changed otherwise if its just to remind them don't put yourself through the heartache again.  They heard you the first time and sadly nothing's going to change.  They believe if they act like you didn't come out then it never happened.  They believe there's something wrong with being LGBTQ+ therefore there's something wrong with you.  Some parents have this messed up idea that something they did made you this way and they're trying to undo by not acknowledging it. Fathers blame mothers for being over protective moms blame dads for not spending enough time blah blah blah.  Yes parents impart a lot of themselves into their children but there's nothing they can do or say or not do to make you LGBTQ+ no more than its anything they did to make you left or right handed.  Parents our only job is to provide a safe loving environment where our kids can be themselves.  So unless you say came out as bi but you're actually gay or trans etc. you don't need to come out again.  My DM'S as always are open to chat."

Am I a part of lgbt or,Global_Warming_,ainbow,"Hey everyone! I'm a 14-year-old cisgender girl and I recently found a label that probably most have never heard of, but it fits me completely. I used to think I was just your average cishet but I always thought I was different from my friends. I never understood their concept of having a crush, as they seemed to always first focus on their crushes' attractiveness 90% of the time. At first, I thought I've never had a crush, and would never have one in the future, but in quarantine, I relieved an old memory. It was short, but I knew exactly what was happening. I was a fourth-grader (Right now I'm a freshman about to go to high school) walking beside a taller boy and his friends. Our conversation was mostly a blur but I remembered I was telling him I was moving to another school and was deeply saddened by that fact. I think I was about to cry but then he patted my head, smiled at me, and said, ""You'll be fine! I hope you'll be happier,"" and at that moment, I felt my eyes watering, my face and ears heat up so much that I tucked my scarf all the way up to my nose. After looking back through my life, I realized that was my first ever crush, innocent and sweet. I also realized that I've never had a crush from that point forward, probably because no one has ever strung a chord in my heart like that. My friends at that time have also consoled me, but it wasn't the same, I felt the difference. His words were also very sweet, he wanted me to be happier, implying that I wasn't very happy in this school. He was right, I had a strict teacher who criticized me for every little mistake I did. I'm a natural perfectionist, so it hurt to hear her exasperation 10x more than it would for a normal person, so I guess I may have seemed a bit off. I thought I hid it well, my friends were happy, I was happy, at least I thought I was. So looking back at that memory, I figured out that he saw my pain, the pain of not being good enough hiding behind a mask. Sorry that the majority of this post is a sappy story, but it is a crucial part of how this label really made me understand myself. What I've realized I wanted, alongside my parents' happiness, is to have a person who understood me more than myself, like that boy, whom I've nicknamed ""Gentle Giant"". I identify as a Heteromantic Demiheterosexual (A person who is romantically attracted to the opposite sex but never experiences sexual attraction, except towards a person /of the opposite sex/ with whom they have a strong emotional connection with. In this case, this demisexual would never develop a sexual attraction towards someone of the same sex, regardless of how close their connection is. But towards someone of the opposite sex, they will once there is a strong emotional connection. &lt; yes I copypasted this off a site lol) I wanted to ask fellow teens as I feel more comfortable asking people my age and I really want to talk and find out if I belong here. Please ask me any questions that you have, I'll be happy to answer them!"

Its your life,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger Warning:  talk of emotions and going back in closet



I was talking to a boy today who was upset because he's forcing himself back in the closet.  He is gay and a femboy.  He came out to his mother the other day and she basically told him if he did this it would hurt her so badly emotionally.  So because he didn't want to be a disappointment to his family he went back in the closet to make her happy.  It is not my kids job to make me happy it is my job to ensure their happiness.  My happiness is not anymore important than theirs.  This poor kid is consumed with others happiness that he's hiding who he is.  It would hurt me to know my kids felt like they had to do that for my happiness.  So many parents use guilt like that to control their kids.  My job as a parent is not to control my kids lives.  My job is to give them tools they need to succeed in life.  Look im not advocating you come out if your in danger by doing so.  In other words if you could be kicked out or abused if you do.  What I am saying is if the only reason you're not coming out is it wouldn't make your family happy ask yourself this question who's making you happy.  The answer no one because when it comes down to it we're responsible for our own happiness.  Can coming out cost you relationships yes im not gonna lie it can.  It can cost you a relationship with your parents or others.

"What really is the definition of ""sexual act""?",Odd_Voice_4234,ainbow,"I'm not sure where this question is appropriate. I'm posting here because it has to do with definitions, and gay sex has changed the once very poor and flawed definition of ""sexual act"" people thought it was, but please let me know if there are more appropriate subreddits (I'm also not here to see what someone subjectively finds ""gross"", this is supposed to be an educational post, so if there is something in this post you find ""gross"", please do not read any further).

I want to know what it means when someone says they just had ""sex"".

""Sex"" is not just ""an activity in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the genitalia of another"", no (and even if that were one of the definitions, why wouldn't two penises or two vulvas stimulating each other be considered sex when two genitals are involved?). There are different types of ""sex"", such as oral sex in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the mouth of another, and anal sex in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the anus of another.

There's cunnilingus and analingus. Cunnilingus is an activity in which a woman's genitalia is stimulated by someone else's mouth or tongue. It's a type of oral sex. Analingus is an activity in which someone's anus is stimulated by someone else's mouth or tongue.

But that's where I'm confused. So far, everywhere I've looked oral sex has been defined as ""when someone uses their mouth to sexually stimulate the genitals of someone else"". Anus is not a genital, so how can analingus be considered oral sex?

Either the definition of oral sex should change to include analingus, or we should consider analingus another form of sex, different from oral sex.

But then there are many other questions. If analingus is a form of sex, or sexual activity, eventhough there are no genitals involved (it's just mouth and anus), why wouldn't other forms of activity that do not involve a genitalia be considered sex? For example, kissing, which is when someone's mouth stimulates someone else's body parts, such as mouth, hand, etc, etc.

Why wouldn't kissing be considered sex, or a sexual activity, just as analingus is?

And if oral sex is a form of sex eventhough only one genital is present, why wouldn't masturbation be considered a form of sex? There is a genitalia involved in masturbation, which is stimulated by the hands, or other objects such as toys. This is exactly similar to oral sex in which only one genital is present, so why wouldn't masturbation be considered sex, or a sexual activity?

And if masturbation can be considered a sexual activity, why wouldn't that mean anyone who has ever masturbated is not a ""virgin"" anymore as they have already had sex, in the form of masturbation?

Or why wouldn't that mean anyone who has ever had oral and/or anal sex is not a ""virgin"" anymore, as they have already had sex, in the forms of oral and anal sex?

There are some people who still think they are ""virgins"" even if they had oral and anal sex. But if these two are forms of sexes, how can someone still be a ""virgin"" after having them?

What even is the definition of ""virginity""? If it means ""someone who has never had sex"", then the sex should include oral and anal sex, and anyone who has ever had oral and anal sex, is not a ""virgin"" anymore.

That's the case if masturbation and kissing are considered sex or sexual activity too. Anyone who has ever kissed someone somewhere, it doesn't have to be another mouth, or masturbated even once is not a ""virgin"" anymore.

Correct me if I'm wrong please."

Lets Talk About Fictosexuality!,Grey_Witch666,ainbow,"Hello all! I am making this post to try and release some of the stigma and hate towards this microlabel. In several fictosexual communities online, members have received gore, death, and other traumatizing threats by people even in the LGBTQ+ community due to misunderstanding on what fictosexuality really is. Hopefully if you've heard this term before and wondered what the heck it was, this will clear it up.

Fictosexuality is a microlabel of gray asexuality. This is quite simply because real fictosexuals do not experience sexual/romantic attraction to *real life* people. The difference between it being a so called ""fetish"" and sexuality, is that one must ONLY be sexually/romantically attracted to fictional characters. For example, if someone says ""I'm fictosexual"" yet is constantly saying ""oh, I'd totally have sex with 'John' next door"", they are absolutely NOT fictosexual. This is called fictophilia. This example is the same as a gay man saying he'd have sex with a woman.

The most common response I hear towards people saying they are fictosexual is ""that's a mockery of the LGBTQ+ community"", yet though I have done loads of research, I have yet to come across proof of this. It needs to be understood that people who genuinely identify with this microlabel such as myself are certainly **not** trying to make a mockery even remotely.

I am a bifictosexual, that is my microlabel. It essentially means I'm attracted to both male and femal fictional characters. My *sexuality* is aro ace, which as many know is a very fluid hard-to-define sexuality that means something different for each person. Much like demisexuality and aegosexuality are both microlabels for being on the asexual spectrum, fictosexual is as well. I am only attracted to fictional characters, not real people for a variety of reasons including trauma.

This term unfortunately get thrown around a lot by people who want to be cringe lords, do not understand what it even actually means, and people who want to make a mockery of it purposely. I hope this has cleared the air around fictosexuality. If you still have any questions, feel free to comment and I will do my best to answer them!

Here are a couple psychological academic journal articles on fictosexuality if you'd like to see further evidence and research on it's validity:

Applying to Scholarships as an LGBT Person,Royal-House-900,ainbow,"Hey y'all! I'm new to reddit and this forum, so I'll briefly introduce myself. I am a BIPOC, Latine, non-binary, trans, intersex, bisexual, polyamorous, and caedograysexual person who is looking to fund their education. As a survivor of sexual assault, it has been hard to stay financially afloat with the extra costs of the aftermath of the traumatic event, so I've applied to over 30 scholarships. The only scholarship I received was one that was specifically for my school and state and it's not nearly enough to cover my 30,000+ financial need. I don't understand what I am doing wrong and I feel like it's because of my complex queer identity that I am not being considered for any scholarships, even LGBT ones. Despite having gone to Harvard for a research program, having a 4.0 GPA, having over 500+ hours of community service in the realm of LGBT ad environmental work, 200+ hours of research experience, starting a non-profit for queer survivors, owning a business for food accessibility, being a drag artist and lots lots more, I feel like it's STILL not enough. I feel like I have to work 100 times harder than the average person to get even half of the opportunities they receive. I don't know how else to tell people that I need the money and am suffering financially. I don't know what else to do or what to say to these scholarships that will make them realize my worthiness. I feel like I'm giving them so much trauma porn and have exhausted so much emotional labor on this that it's affecting my mental health. Are there any other queers here who have similar experiences with scholarships? And if so, what do you do to meet your financial needs? How do you get the scholarships you do? I'm desperate at this point."

So I'm a bit lost at what I can do for my Etsy shop and what to do for my next art project. I've been wanting to do some pride related pieces for my shop, but I'm at a standstill for what to do. Here are the pride pieces that I have on my shop currently to give you an idea of what I'm able to do.

"Had unprotected oral, need help!",Gene1989,ainbow,"HI,
About 12 days ago I had an encounter with a trans sex worker. I gave her a unprotected blowjob for close to 45 minutes and then she returned the favor (also unprotected). She smoked meth for almost the entire session and I used poppers the entire time (no meth for me). The sex worker did not ejaculate into my mouth though there was a bit of precum. I did ejaculate into her mouth. Regardless of using meth she had very good dental hygiene and so did I. My question is what is the likelihood of me contracting HIV from this situation?
thank you,

So many of you messaged me yesterday really just wanting to know how to make your parents understand.  To get them to see this isn't a phase or a sin or influence of social media or friends.  To get them to see you really were born this way.  You just wanted them to be proud of you and love you for who you are.  Like I told a bunch of you last night its not your job to make them proud of you its their job to already be proud of you.  My pride in my kids doesn't come from their accomplishment or things they do.  Yes I celebrate those things with them but my pride comes from them simply being my child and that goes for my niece and nephew and any of you that need me to be a parent.  When my kids were born I wasn't hoping for a boy or a girl or whatever gender they were.  I was just excited to be a dad regardless.  My pride was already there.  I knew before they were even born there was nothing they would ever do or say to change that.  They could fail every class im still proud because that's my child.  They can get into trouble im still proud that's my child.  I will help them learn from their mistakes but never not be proud of them.  I even reached out to my dad yesterday first time in 34 years.  I wanted to see if we could mend the past.  First thing he said when he realized who I was before this conversation gets started son answer me one thing do you still date guys.  I said yes I do that's never changing and he hung up on me.  Did it hurt a little but its on him to change and learn.  We can give people all the information in the world on LGBTQ+ but if they're not willing to change its on them.  I get we want to please our parents I believe there's something born inside us to want to do that.  I have learned from being a dad my job is to always be proud of my kids and love and support them regardless of what they do.  I know we all need parental guidance from time to time especially our youth the kids and teens in the community.  If you want or need a virtual dad or parent period im here.  I might not know how to do everything but between google and YouTube we can figure it out.  My DM'S are open message me."

The Best LGBT+ Movies on Netflix Right Now,FalenFdo,ainbow, 
About JK Rowling,AmIACow,ainbow,"I really like Harry Potter. I have read the books, seen the movies and I'm currently collecting the Hogwarts Lego sets. However, I strongly disagree with JK Rowling about a lot of things, especially her transphobic comments. I feel guilty for liking Harry Potter because of those, and I'm afraid to claim that I like the series because I don't want people to think that I support the author's claims. Trans people are beautiful and I want to support them. Is it wrong to like something even when its creator has said or done bad things?"
Should I hide being gay forever?,Soggy-Knowledge-6027,ainbow,"I'm gay. I wish I wasn't, but there isn't much I can do about it. I decided a long time ago that I'd just never say anything to anyone about it, pretend that I wasn't, and that it's probably best to be alone forever instead of putting up with hate from family and society. I've liked people before, but I've never said anything and hadn't ever planned to.

I'm participating in a program at my university this summer, and last week I met this guy on campus. If I could order a human being like a cheeseburger, he's literally what would come out of it. I haven't known him for long, but I can't help but love him to bits. We have a lot common interests, he's a ton of fun to talk to, literally one of the smartest people I've ever met, I feel comfortable around him, and he's absolutely adorable .

We were talking the other day, and he brought up how people treat him differently knowing he's gay. I try incredibly hard to hide it, and so I was a little surprised when he said ""I get the feeling you know how it is"". I felt comfortable enough around him that I confessed, and later that night he messaged me to ask if I'd like to date.

I don't know what to do :(. I never considered what I'd say if someone expressed interest in me. I *absolutely* want to, but I'm scared. If my family ever found out, I'd absolutely get kicked out, and possible far worse. They've told me that if I ever ""turned out to be a fag"" they'd ""blow my brains out"". I've been shot at by my drunken father more than once before, and I absolutely believe it. On top of that, I'm worried about how people will look at me if they found out. I don't want to be ""the gay guy"". I was pretty socially isolated as a kid, and I've made a lot of new friends over the last couple of years since getting away from my parents a bit. What if they don't like me anymore?

I'm confused. I really, really want to. He's soooo nice, I don't want to hurt his feelings. But if I allow even the slightest crack, there's no going back. I'll forever be that gay guy, and everything that comes with it :(.

What should I do? I should add that, if things *were* to go anywhere, there would be the extra complicating factor that he'll be transferring to a new college next year, which is a 4 or 5 hour drive away.

Thanks guys :)"
How do I deal with people who are homophobic at work without being outed?,crystal_platinum,ainbow,"Okay idk if this is the right sub because I dont use Reddit too often but I need help. For some context, I live in a pretty conservative town and am a racial minority, am bisexual and non binary. I still go by he/him and present mostly as male but thats besides the point. At work people are constantly using racial and homophobic slurs and Im outnumbered and dont know what to do.  Today one of my coworkers who uses homophobic slurs a lot asked if I thought he was sexy which made me really uncomfortable because not only is he homophobic/racist, but I am in no way attracted to him. One of my other coworkers commented on how I turned red but I only turned red because of how embarrassing and violating it felt. Im from out of state and moved here a year ago and my car has a small rainbow on it and maybe Im not straight/cis passing but i feel really uncomfortable around him. Its weird because he makes homophobic slurs but is attached to me in a way I dont like. Im afraid to be like hey thats not okay to say or call them out in general because Im worried Ill be treated badly or harassed. Idk."

Father's day surprise,bi_dad48,ainbow,First to anyone reading this that's a father Happy Fathers day!  My kids took me to my favorite restaurant for part of my fathers day present.  It's a Mexican restaurant I love.  Mexican food is my favorite and it was good today.  Place was busy of course but worth it.  After we ordered I got up to use the restroom and when I came back I noticed the family seated next to us that the son had a subtle pride bracelet on.  While we were waiting on our food I heard the boy tell his family he was gay.  I could tell he was nervous im guessing unsure how'd they would react.  I was prepared for a possible scene cause you never know.  He used a method I recommend if you're not sure and that's do it in a public place so if they react badly you at least buy some time.  His dad however got up hugged him and started bawling.  Turns out when dad finally calmed down where he could talk that dad is bi so he was very accepting.  They both kinda had a coming out hell even I cried a little.  I bought their meal it was just so touching.  Im sure this kind of thing happens more than we know but it seems like everywhere I go during pride something like this is happening its so heartwarming to see.  This is a proper reaction when children come out.  Now I know some of you aren't as fortunate so if you need a virtual dad please message me im glad to help.  My DM'S are always open.

Happy fathers day? Not for everyone,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger Warning: homelessness and homophobia


There are hundreds of thousands of kids maybe more world wide who are homeless and without support all because of homophobic parents or caregivers.  I was thinking about that last night at home after I watched families at a local pride event and how happy they were.  I was kicked out when I came out at 14 and was homeless for awhile.  My niece and nephew were kicked out but I was able to take them in.  So many kids and teens aren't a lucky and things you do to survive I won't even mention.  I know there's shelters in place already but there's just not enough.  I would love to adopt everyone of them and give them the love and support and freedom to express themselves.  Unfortunately I can't do that and my heart aches because of it.  Its fathers day today and instead of being with their dad they're on the streets or in a shelter wondering what's next.  What's just as bad or at least a close second is those of you still at home hiding in the closet for fear of the same happening to you forced to fake fathers day just to survive.  I may not can adopt all of you but hope to adopt some.  To those of you who need a supportive dad let me be him virtually.  Message me with questions or if you need a virtual hug.  Tell me how your day was what your friends are up to whatever I really want to know and be there for you.  Don't suffer my DM'S are open reach out to me."

My kids made several friends and I even got a few numbers lol.  I looked around tonight and wondered how long its going to take before this can be normal.

Proud Mama at Wally World,Bloodskyangel,ainbow,"Obligatory Im on mobile so sorry if anything isnt clear or easy to read.

So I work at Walmart (Im quitting so Im not worried about people finding me lol) and we had a pride day yesterday for workers. I wish they had announced it better because so many of us didnt know about it and I only saw two workers go balls to the wall with their rainbow get up (they were straight allies so it was funny but appreciated). I still technically celebrated because Ive been wearing my pride pins all month.

So far my pins havent garnered any attention which was a good and bad thing. Good, because Ive heard customers make homophobic and transphobic remarks so I dont want that kind of attention. Bad, because I picked super cute pins and I wanted compliments lol. But that pride day my pins would finally be recognized for an experience I dont think Ill forget. 

I was helping a very nice lady at the self checkout. At the end of the transaction she paused and turned to me.

Dont take this in a bad way or anything but are you? She points at my pride pins.

I confirm with a simple yes and prepare for her to drop her nice facade for homophobic wrath.

Oh! Wonderful! I have some questions if you dont mind??

I nod politely but still bare myself for the worst. She explains that her daughter just came out to her recently and she wanted to know how to proceed. She expressed how much she loved her daughter and how she always knew deep down that her daughter was gay. She was so proud of her baby but noticed that her daughter was slowly distancing herself when she asked questions.

As the lady went on about their relationship and how she wanted to celebrate pride more so than her daughter seemed too I noticed the problem she was having. I let her know that she was coming off a little too strong and that her support may be too invasive.

I told her that she wasnt wrong for loving her child and being so happy but she should allow her child to lead this conversation since this is her daughters experience. It was like with straight children being embarrassed when their parents ask about their new SO. She just needed to take a step back and let her child come to her.

My heart broke as she cried tears of pride and joy for her daughter. A part of me wished my parents had a similar reaction when I first came out.

If somehow you are seeing this, proud mama, I do thank you. Thank you for being such a good mama to your daughter and giving me hope for the future. With so many stories I have heard of parents harming their child and even killing them based on pure speculation of their childrens identity, knowing first hand that there are parents out there like you warms my jaded queer heart.

I hope for a future where the worst a parent can do to their queer child is embarrass them with innocent questions."
Support and Questions,dawnmd2526,ainbow,"This is going to be long, and Im trying to use the correct terminology. Sorry in advance if I make mistakes. Im trying to learn.

I have always been a supporter of LGBTQ people and their rights. I have both gay men and gay women friends. This is probably why Im struggling so much. 

I am a single mom and a teacher at a middle school. In the last few years in our community, the number of females that have come out as gay or bi has been extremely high. Im not exaggerating when I say that well over half of females ages 12-15 are Identifying as gay, bi, or trans. 

My daughter (13) told me about a little over a year ago that she was pansexual. I didnt know what it meant at the time, but she explained it to me and I was all, ok. Then a few months later she was bi. Now shes gay. 

During this time, I cautioned her not to put a label on herself because she was still growing and figuring out who she was. She just started puberty. We are very open about it and talk a lot. 

She has asked to get her hair cut really short. Because of the frizzy hair that runs in my family, I have hesitated because it would be a lot of work for her to do her hair, and honestly, in the summer it doesnt matter what you try to do to it. Think Monica on Friends when she went on vacation somewhere tropical. 

Today she told me she wants to be referred to with they/them pronouns. It hit me hard and Ive been crying since. Im struggling for several reasons: 

1. I honestly believe its trendy in our community to be a member of the LGBTQ community. Im a supporter, but I myself identify as straight. School counselors have said the same, and not just from our school.
Im all for people figuring out their preferences and discovering who they are. I believe there is a spectrum, and people fall on all different parts. I can admire and appreciate a beautiful woman. I prefer having sexual relationships with men. 

2. That being said, I really dont think she is what she thinks she is/wants to be. Ive worked with LOTS of kids in 20 years. I have a pretty good feeling about this stuff, and Im rarely surprised by people when they come out. Now. I could be too close in this case and cant see the forest for the trees. I get it. 

3. Most of all, I feel a huge loss of what I thought was my daughter. I almost feel like she died, and Im not sure how to move on. I would never show her how upset I am, and I have been trying to be very supportive. 

Please dont tell me what a shitty parent I am or how I dont get it. I am trying. I see other parents on social media about how proud they are and how happy they are for their LGBTQ kids, and I am not there. Has any other parent dealt with this? Any advice would be appreciated. Please spare me the harsh criticism. I feel horrible enough as it is."

18 Male here. I was raised in a super religious family. Back then when I was 12-13 and you know when the horniness showed up, I turned to gay porn bcuz I thought doing so is less of a sin than watching regular porn. Fast forward to nowadays, after 6 years of wanking to gay porn and fantasizing about men, I still have that belief in me because I still refuse to have any sexy thought about women. I don't think I have ever masturbated with a normal porn or ever thought of having sex with woman.
I simply get turned on by a penis pic. A boobs/vagina pic? No.
I feel like im sexually attracted to men but emotionally attracted to women. What the fuck is this?
Today, I had my second sex (a hookup on grindr). The kisses didn't bring me any emotion... It almost felt like a masturbation... The orgasm wasn't enjoyable.. maybe i/him didn't perform good enough? Maybe he was attractive to me? There could be hundreds of possibilities .
Now I think like I may not be gay? Am I just brainwashed by porn? Am I bi?gay?straight? What the hell am I? Again, there could be many possibilities...
If anyone here also has the same experience or knows how to help me, please give me some advice because im tired of this. Thanks!"

Feel good story,bi_dad48,ainbow,Feel good story time.  I love meeting families that are allies or are LGBTQ+ .  I was in Walmart earlier which I hate our Walmart but sometimes you just have to go.  I met family mom dad 2 kids.  Dad and son were wearing matching rainbow unicorn tank tops mom had rainbow hair and the little girl had rainbow Crocs on.  Naturally being the social butterfly I am I spoke to them.  Their son 12 years old came out as gay this year its their first pride month celebrating.  We talked a good hour there in Walmart.  I told them I was bi but leaned more to guys so they asked what to expect.  Now I don't sugar coat anything.  We live in the south its not easy for LGBTQ+ here.  I said he may get bullied be called names etc. just be prepared.  I did say it has gotten better over the years and gave them my number if they needed an ally.  My kids surprised me because they gave him each one of their pride bracelets they were wearing as a welcome to the community.  Guys this is proper parenting.  I know some of y'all don't get that support so if you need it im available just DM me.  We're going to a pride event this afternoon maybe I'll have another story.
Need support. Bi girl here.,xdcocacolaxd,ainbow,"So I am bisexual in a very homophobic family. I remember talking about this with my mom and she told me that she would support me even if i married a woman.

But now, I came out to my father, he took it as a personal attack, called me the f word, called me a sick person. But now when i called my mom for support she took my dads side, said that I was brainwashed my the society etc. (but she is not as harsh as dad). But i knew i liked girls way before i was on social media, i barely knew about lgbtq when i knew i liked girls.

And also.. i have a boyfriend whom i love very much, but his family is homophobic af (but my boyfriend isn't and he supports me) so i can't be myself around them.

So... i want your help, should I

a. Go back to the closet, i need my parents support now, i can't move out just yet. And for my boyfriend - i am planning to marry him (in the future of course) so what is the point of people knowing that i am the part of lgbtq?

"What are the arguments against ""being penetrated and being submissive are feminine""?",Odd_Voice_4234,ainbow,"Homophobes tend to believe being a ""bottom"" ""feminizes"" a man. Even in drawings and writings done by them, a man who is penetrated is seen as ""feminine"" and portrayed as ""weaker"" and smaller than the man that penetrates.

This comes from the belief that because women evolved to be penetrated, when a man is penetrated, he acts like a woman, takes a woman's role, and is therefore ""feminized"", ""feminine"" and ""less of a man"".

It is the same for submissiveness. Their belief is women evolved to be submissive and weak, so when a man is penetrated, or gives control to another man and lets him lead (during sex or regular events), he is being submissive, and weak, acting like a woman and taking a woman's role, and is therefore ""feminized"", ""feminine"" and ""less of a man"".

Can you provide any arguments against these claims please?"

Lets encourage our kids,bi_dad48,ainbow,Took my kids to the lake today.  My nephew ( he still prefers he/him for now) wore a bikini today in public for the first time.  He shaved his body so he felt more feminine and he swam like it was normal (which I believe it is clothing has no gender) for him to be in a bikini.  We played and laughed and got a little sunburned but had a ball.  We received no bad comments or stares that i heard or saw.  I did have a couple come up and talk to me.  It turns out their 13 year old said they were trans ftm and asked me what they should do.  I explained it's simple love him encourage him talk to his doctor about puberty blockers to give him more time.  He will let you know what he needs from clothing to haircut's whatever.  They were very accepting.  Him and my nephew talked he thought it was brave of him to wear a bikini.  We had several people tells how awesome its was he was allowed to wear a bikini.  I simply thanked them and said if we just encourage our kids and love them and let them be who they are the world would be better.  I even received a few compliments on my painted toenails.

Am I hopeless...!?,Fantastic-Promise-99,ainbow,"I (22M) just recently have mostly accepted who I am not out and proud but I'm slowly coming to terms with this. (Live in one of the most homophobic countries in Europe so it's quite hard.
I created a grindr account and apparently that's the only place where I can find gay/bi men without spending eternity looking for someone on other social media.

I really want to have my 1st experiment with a guy but I have this awkward feeling to chat with a guy like flirting or anything  but I really do want to start somewhere. 
One guy (absolutely very handsome/hot) sent me his profile pic all I did was sent him ""you look amazing but I'm just networking"" and bailed from the app. (am  I hopeless)
Plus I have this feeling that no way he or others are gay/bi that this just some mix up. I guess it's very hard to accept this when I have grown in a homophobic society. 

I do have quite a problem to start conversations with people though once I'm opened to them I just can't stop talking. Plus so far it works mostly with girls since apparently straight men don't like that I talk to much.

I'M GETTING TOP SURGERY!!,mc_stealth,ainbow,"Hi everyone!

I have a huge announcement! After over 3 months of waiting for a new top surgery date, I finally have gotten an updated top surgery consultation date!! I made a YouTube video about it so I thought I would share it here :) 

Here is the link to the top surgery consultation video: [https://youtu.be/4Rg\_ISoKUpY](https://youtu.be/4Rg_ISoKUpY)

If you would like to learn why my top surgery was cancelled in March, I made a video about that as well, here is the link!: [https://youtu.be/6oBkZitfsRM](https://youtu.be/6oBkZitfsRM)

Here is some info about me as well: 

My name is Josh and I am an 18 years old FTM (female to male) transgender man. I have made youtube videos every now and again for the past 8 years but now I am really taking it seriously. My goal is to help other LGBTQ youth, LGBTQ adults and specifically, transgender individuals get through their days and to make their days a little brighter. I want to be someone that other LGBTQ youth can look at and see that I got to the age of 18. I got through the part of life that they think they would never even get close to. I am now over a year on testosterone and I am so so proud of myself for how far I have come. As long as I can make a difference in someone's life and put a smile on somebody's face than I believe this whole thing is worth it.

Which gender identity suits my situation best?,Moldy_Cheese-Mullet,ainbow,"Hi everyone!  
So I've never really thought about my gender.  
I've always known I wasn't straight and have been researching till I finally found omnisexual.  
Now, after finding this magical term and realising that there are SO MANY terms I've never heard of, I've started thinking about my gender.  


I quickly found out that I'm non-binary. More specifically she/they.  
I feel the best about they/them and would prefer people use these pronouns instead of she/her. But I'm cool with she/her since I'm AFAB and know I'm usually very feminine presenting.  
But is there a word for my situation that's more specific than non-binary?  


Like, I know of terms like bi-gender, genderfluid, genderqueer etc. and I'm just really confused which one fits my situation best.  
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  
Have a great day!"
I really am serious,bi_dad48,ainbow,"TW:  I'm putting trigger warnings now in my post because I didn't realize something I didn't think sounded triggering could still be and last thing I want to do is upset anyone.  This post talks of emotions and unsupportive family


My kids and I were talking last night and when I say kids that means my niece and nephew to me they're my kids now to.  We were talking about lots of things but mainly what started us talking was how I post about wanting to be a virtual parent to anyone who needs it.  They've seen my post where I've said you can yell at my cry with me talk to me whatever you need.  They think it's awesome because that's how it is here but they asked would I really let strangers do that.  First in a sense i don't see us as strangers we're all family in LGBTQ+ in my opinion.  Second yes I mean it.  I know life isn't fair and right now some maybe even a majority of you are struggling.  Maybe you're out but parents act like its not true.  They refuse to use your pronouns or new name or they say you're hetero you've just been spending too much time on social media.  Maybe you're not out and you have anxiety through the roof because your family is homophobic and you know you could never tell them right now.  Whatever your situation it builds up emotions.  Anger, sadness, frustration, etc.  You need to get it out so yes I mean it when I say unload on me as if I'm the parent you're mad at tell me off cuss me out whatever just let it out.  I also want to be the parent when you have questions about LGBTQ or anything else but you can't go to them come to me.  If I don't have the answers I will try and find them.  This time in your life you need guidance if I can help please let me know.  My DM'S are open hmu."
May I have some comforting words?,pandabooraccoon,ainbow,"Homophobia trigger, rant ahead. 

Hi, I'm from Hungary and I'm queer, plenty of you probably know how much my government sucks...

I've just read the new homophobic law package, I shouldn't have cause it obviously upset me but I wanted to be informed yknow?

It's all so vile and I just want to move away from here, I'm so angry, sad and near to tears. I don't feel safe in this country as a queer person, I wouldn't feel safe being public if I were to be in an obviously non-hetero relationship. I won't go to this year's Pride, would've been my first but I'm too scared to. It angers me that I'll have to work and generate money for this piece of shit government to be able to build experience and savings.

Oh so fortunately my family is accepting, that is the only saving grace right now but it's not enough to want to remain here. I'm trying to at least channel my anger and spite to get a job and make my own personal existence better but it's still just hard...

Could any of you please offer me some comforting words, that's all I'd like please, I wish you all a nice day."
Good points were made.,ottoleedivad,ainbow, 
Advice?,Low_Top5189,ainbow,"Im gay and Ive always gotten vibes that a friend of mine whos a guy likes me as he was always so sweet with his words towards me. He could be closeted or just simply a really nice guy. I have had crushes on guys before based on only looks, but I felt something different with this guy because I had never met a guy who wasnt so judgemental when it came to how high my voice or how gay people said I was. Anytime we talked to one another while making eye contact, hed always smile at me but I could tell he was trying not to smile.

When we would text, it was usually him reaching to me first all the time (which I feel bad about because it may have made him think I wasnt interested even though I was) just to talk about something he knows I like or something funny that had happened during the school day. 

When I told him I was gay, he was super supportive about it and would always defend me if anyone said anything rude to me about it. I noticed that he became nicer and more soft towards me after I told him I was gay (probably my mind playing tricks on me since I liked him and wanted him to like me). An example of this was when my birthday was near and I told him that I like to stay home on my birthday from school, and he told me how he really wanted to see me on my birthday and pretty much begged me to come to school that day...I think he said pleaseee like 3 times.
 
Also, there was a particular time when we were texting and he told me that he had made the school soccer team...and when I told him congratulations, plz go win our school team a game he invited me to come to all of his games and said that he wanted me to cheer for him. (Some people Ive talked to say this is flirting while others say that its just friendly).

Later that year, unfortunately for me I told friends I thought I could trust about my crush on him and it ended up getting back to him. I felt so ashamed and that I had probably made him uncomfortable and weirded out by me which really messed my head up for the next few months. After it got out to him he had stopped texting me, which was a sign to me that he was actually straight this whole time and I was just being stupid. My friends and I would still catch him staring at me sometimes afterward, but about 2 months after him finding out he moved to a completely different state.

After he moved, thats when he unfollowed me off of instagram and ended up waiting to block me completely on instagram a month after already unfollowing me. (of course this broke my heart) But I knew that I couldnt be mad at him for blocking me. If I had made him uncomfortable then it was my fault and he had every right to do so, so I started my process of getting over him.

After 2 months of having me blocked, I get a notification one day on Instagram that he was requesting to follow me again meaning he had unblocked me. I cant say that I wasnt happy seeing that...but it confused me. We ended up following one another again but he never actually messaged me or anything of the sort.


Fast forward 7-8 months later when I was finally starting to really get over him, he randomly hearts an old DM I sent him years ago and we hadnt even texted on Instagram via DMs in over a year (which could mean he mightve been reading our old messages maybe but I dont know or maybe wanted to get my attention?) 2 months after that, he actually DMs me on Instagram out of the blue asking me if I remembered him and how I had been. He ended up adding me on snapchat and asked me to start a streak which allowed us to talk to each other more and more again. One day though, I had posted a video of a friend (girl) and I in the bed together while I was at her house hanging out and he slid up on the story asking me you get pu**y now? Which confused me because I thought he knew I was gay as I told him myself AND 2 people had told him I had feelings for him a year prior. In my mind I was like HOW DO YOU EVEN FORGET SOMETHING LIKE THAT because my entire life people knew I gay before they had ever even spoken to me. So it made no sense to me how all of the sudden the ONE person I had extreme feelings for was the one who presumably forgot I was gay. When I told him I was gay again, he said oh yeah lol and then proceeded to ask me if I had a boyfriend. People Ive talked to about this have said he really didnt forget and he used it as a cover up to know my relationship status since he is likely closeted. They also said there was no way he could have forgotten that people had told him that I liked him prior to him moving away. When I said I was single he never made a move on me though, wed just continue to text for days after. 

He would go on to eventually ask me if I had ever come out to my parents yet and asking me what they said about me coming out. (Not sure if he wanted to know because hes closeted himself or just curious)
(And also this may not mean much, but he follows half naked models on Instagram which leads me to thinking hes straight again but this could just be something he does that he is never suspected as gay but idk).
We are currently still friends and he recently said he missed me in a birthday text.

Im sorry to those who actually took the time to read this, im just very confused and dont know if he truly did have feelings for me or he simply was being friendly when he recontacted me. 
Id appreciate your input and opinions, thank you!"

Safe environment,bi_dad48,ainbow,Well I got home this afternoon and as I walked in the door I heard laughing and music coming from the family room.  The kids were having an impromptu fashion show and helping my nephew with his makeup.  They were having a blast being able to express themselves and talk to each other about LGBTQ+ issues they were having or dating or just anything.  They didn't stop when I walked in because they know they can be themselves and talk to each other or me about anything.  It struck me as I was listening to them that so many kids and teens not just LGBTQ+ kids and teens don't have that opportunity.  Their parents refuse to talk about certain topics because its not proper or whatever.  So kids grow up thinking sexuality and gender and LGBTQ+ and many things are bad when in reality they aren't.  Kids and teens hell all of us need an environment where we feel safe to be ourselves and to ask questions and talk about things on our minds regardless of what they are.  Parents are supposed to nurture that kind of environment but they fail a lot of times.  If you don't have that kind of environment I'll be the virtual parent you can turn to.  I will answer your questions and help you feel safe to be yourself.  You don't have to do this alone.  My DM'S are open all you gotta do is talk.

I'll be there for you,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Trigger warning: brief mention of losing family and friends when coming out

After the events of the past few days ( if you need details dm me) I have really been inspired to do all I can to help LGBTQ youth and adults.  My goal here has always been to help.  To be a virtual parent or friend whichever is better for you, whichever you need.  I know a lot of us in the lgbtqia+ community if we've come out have lost family and friends or either don't have a good relationship with our parents if any at all.  We also have members who are afraid to come out and lose the relationship they do have.  Some of you may just simply have questions or need advice but don't want to talk to your parents about it.  Some may need a friend with a shoulder to cry on.  Whatever it is I can be the parent or friend for the moment and help you talk it through or answer your questions.  If your frustrated and upset yell at me let it out if it helps you to be able to stay in the closet until its safe to come out or just simply deal with your parents better.  I can and will be the virtual parent you want or need when your own parents won't or you feel you just can't talk to them. If you need a friend that's LGBTQ in here to share in your joy's and sadness. Everyone needs someone to talk to for advice usually its your parents but as we know for LGBTQ kids and teens some parents shut us down or kick us out so talk to me let me help you if I can.  My DM'S are open for anyone."
Advice for coworker fetishizing nb people.,danielle1525,ainbow,"Im 22 non-binary and work 3rd shift at a grocery store stocking shelves at night. The lack of customers keeps misgendering me and harassment to a minimum and many people have told me they like my more masculine style. 
However, there is a 19 year old that works with me that I came out to. He seemed chill before that and I figured his age would mean hes a little more plugged in than the 50 year olds I work with. Immediately after I came out, he told me about another NB person he knows that has had top surgery but not bottom and how much he wants to have sex with them just for the experience. He also said he didnt care if someone was ugly as hell as long as he could have sex with someone with boobs and a dick. I was uncomfortable with that and said it sounded like he was fetishizing trans people. He tried to laugh that off and kept saying he just wanted to say that he had. I said people are not new flavors of coke and you dont get to try them out. I then said I was finished talking about it and he kept trying to get me to debate him. I said I didnt want to and he said his feelings were on the line. I said his feelings are not my problem. Then I said I wasnt amused and walked away. After I clocked out I found him again and said fuck you, whats wrong with you? I tell you Im non-binary and the first thing you do is tell me how much you want to fuck another nb person? That was so rude and walked away. 

I am frustrated that this happened but Im curious if anyone has any advice for if someone tells you something like this? What should I do if he tries to talk to me?"

Talk to your parents,bi_dad48,ainbow,I pride myself on being professional and doing my job well.  Part of that job is being compassionate but keeping it together it the same time.  Very seldom does anything get to me to where im visibly shaken and emotional.  Today it did though working the funeral for the 2 thirteen year olds. I am an emotional wreck.  They did acknowledge the boys relationship which was great but it was just sad they had to die.  I am going home i told my boss I need a mental health day I can't be here right now.  Guys talk to your parents find out where they stand on LGBTQ issues.  Don't suffer in silence wondering if you can ever come out.  Talk to them so maybe you can be free to live your life you deserve.  I will post more tonight after I decompress.  As always though I am available still for chat my DM'S are open.

You're not a mistake,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Today im directing the funeral of 2 thirteen year old boys who died because of who they were.  Because their sexuality was different than heterosexual.  Because they loved each other but felt they must be wrong because society says anything other than hetero is a mistake.  Friends you're not a mistake.  Your not the result of a birth defect or the sins of the father or anything like that.  You are who you were meant to be.  I know trans people hear ""you're not trans god doesn't make mistakes"" a lot.  My response is if that's true explain babies born with medical issues or hermaphroditic babies being born etc.  Sometimes people are born the wrong gender and need to change.  For the rest of us who aren't trans were not mistakes either.  If you're born with attraction to same sex or everyone regardless of gender how can it be a mistake.  No amount of therapy or conversion camps can change therefore not a mistake.  We've been living our lives in fear because we believed something was wrong with us.  In reality the problem is close minded people not willing to see that no one chooses a life of bullying and loss.  Hell we've hated a race of people for years because of the color of their skin.  Hated them for something they had no control over.  How stupid are we to hate for skin color and not even get to the person.  Just as stupid as hating someone for who they love.  Now I know im probably not reaching the ones who need to hear this and I do post in other social media so maybe just maybe they word will get out.  We are not mistakes my friends we are human beings dammit its time the world realizes it."

Stand up for yourself,bi_dad48,ainbow,"We all fight everyday for equality for LGBTQIA+ individuals.  Collectively there are rights common to us all, but have you ever wondered who's going to stand up for you for your individual rights.  Who's going to fight for you when your misgendered or they use your wrong name etc.  Im not just talking support I mean stand up for your rights.  Yes there are warriors fighting for national and world rights.  People with political connections needed to make a difference.  When it comes to you and me and every other LGBTQIA+ member individually who's fighting for us.  The answer we are.  We each individually have to stand up for ourselves at some point.  When you're misgendered  you have to stand up.  When they use your wrong pronouns you have to stand up.  When they use your wrong name you have to stand up.  When you don't get the promotion because of your gender or sexuality you have to stand up.  No one can fight these battles for us.  You have the individual right to be who you were born to be and love who you want to love.  It just may mean you have to fight for it and stand up for yourself even if its against family and friends.  If you've already came out to them and they said they'd be supportive but aren't remind them.  Now if you're not out yet only do so if its safe.  Don't put yourself in harm's way unless you're prepared to be kicked out or harmed.  I never recommend coming out like that but only you know when you're ready and if you are then fight for your rights to you deserve it.  I'm still here as a virtual parent and i can help you prepare if you DM me but the actual fight is yours.  You can do it you're stronger than you know."

Genderqueer and could use some help pls,zoethepancake,ainbow,"So hi, first of all I use all pronouns and I'm pan, nice to meet ya. 
I'm hope I'm on the right subreddit with my question.
Like I said I use all pronouns, but I don't rly look like every gender. (Or as it's seen in today's society). Now I present myself often more in a feminine way, wear 'girls' clothing (hate that stereotyp but so U can understand better) but like I'm still not a girl, or well not totally. I also was born in a femal body, maybe that's important.

Now the actual question is about gay male people. Like I know I'm also kinda male, cuz like all pronouns and I feel like that too, but I don't know if I'm allowed to date gay male people? It just rly confuses me, cuz I'm male but also not. Like im everything and I don't wanna make people uncomfortable. 

Please does anyone have help, I'm rly lost."

Let go of confusion,bi_dad48,ainbow,As a parent I want to talk about something that may help some of you possibly a lot of you.  This is simply my opinion others may have another take and that's fine all input is welcome.  A lot of people seem to struggle with being confused.  Confused if they're bi or gay or lesbian or pan or trans or ace or intersex etc.  Same goes for gender male or female or enby or etc.  I told my kids don't let confusion bring you down or make you feel invalidated. I've met more people who were confused over sexuality and gender than I have those who've know right away.  Don't worry if for example you think you're bi and later figure out you're gay or lesbian.  Don't worry if you think you're trans and turns out your not.  None of this invalidates you.  This is a journey for most of us its not a flat 2 lane road.  Its multiple lanes and curve's and turnoffs and you just have to keep going until you find your destination.  Enjoy the journey let go if the confusion.

My HIV Results Came Back...,redballer1,ainbow,"Hey everyone, I lost my virginity by engaging in gay sex exactly 45 hours ago involving deep tongue kissing, unprotected rough deepthroating (both ends), and protected anal (both ends) via condom. I did not come into contact with my partners cum at ANY point in time. Probably only his pre-cum when I was licking his dick. But I did unfortunately brush my teeth 15 min before so this had me super scared.

Today I went in for a STD test, the HIV rapid test came back as.... NEGATIVE. So I am somewhat relieved but I'm still nervous for all the other STDs since the urine/bloodwork will take 7-10 days to process at the facility and because what if the HIV test was a false negative since it's only been 2 days???

I also paid over $3,000+ for PEP (post exposure prophylaxis) today and got onto the pills a hour ago.

Does anyone have any other stories, experiences, or advice they could calm me with? I would really appreciate it as I'm very scared and anxious of ending up with HIV from kissing/oral even though the chance is like 5%.

Thank you."

Parents won't accept me as bi...don't know what to do,ac-1560,ainbow,"To start this off, I'm nearing a breaking point where I just absolutely don't know what to do since I want to be fully out but I still feel unaccepted and hidden from my family and community. I'm a 20-year-old bi girl who lives in a small town in the South with Christian parents, and last year my sister outed me to my parents, with horrible results. I am still physically safe and wasn't kicked out or anything, but my mom especially did not take it well despite me trying to explain that I had felt that way since middle school and couldn't help it. She basically told me it was a ""phase"" and that my sexuality is a choice, and that I should just be normal for my parents' sake especially since our church has many homophobes. I was guilted for days, accused of tormenting my mother with this, and my mom was overall upset with me and telling me I needed to be with a man. Fast forward to after ignoring the topic and dating a man for a short while purely for my parents' sake, my female cousin comes out as bi on her Instagram today and my mom makes disgusted comments about her doing it for attention and being selfish ""since her sexuality is a choice"" whereas some gay people commit suicide. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand discouraging someone from posting that just for attention when there are those who can't be out, but the comments from my mother were overall rude and definitely directed towards me and my sexuality. After that, I sort of lost it with my mother and now things are weirdly quiet between us. So, here we are; I have no idea what to do because I'm not a perfect daughter by any means but am I really selfish for just wanting my sexuality to at least not be disregarded by my parents? I just want them to accept all of me; not just the ""normal"" parts that maintain their reputation in our still close-minded town. I love them, but I'm so stressed and afraid that if I keep pushing about my sexuality they'll threaten to cut off my college tuition...Any advice would be appreciated."
Parents start communicating with your kids its not to late,bi_dad48,ainbow,Suicide and depression are still too high among lgbtqia+ kids and teens.  I should know if you've read my previous posts you know im working on a funeral for 2 teenage boys who died because they feared they couldn't talk to their parents.  Turns out the problem was they never told their kids they would support them if they were gay or bi etc.   So 2 kids turned to suicide mainly because they were afraid to come out and in reality they could have.  Many lgbtqia+ kids and teens stress and agonize over their gender and sexuality and when or if to come out.   One of the biggest things they stress over is where do my parents stand.  Are they allies or are they against lgbtqia+ all together.  Parents your kids shouldn't have to wonder about those things.  I grew up in a time where parents didn't believe kids needed to know their stance on things.  Times have changed though but not enough.  Kids and teens wouldn't it be great if you could have open honest conversation with your parents so you know ahead of time there stance on such issues.  So many parents are still so close minded to talk about gender and sexuality or hell even sex and puberty with their kids.  It leaves kids figuring things our on their own.  I personally prefer my kids be getting that information from me than a stranger or another friend. If kids could really talk to their parents openly and honestly about these things it would be easier for them to come to them as they had questions.  Its how I was with my kids its why they knew they could come out and talk about it with me.  Kids shouldn't have to fear their parents reaction to coming out or anything else.  Home is the one place they should be able to really be themselves.  We need to some how educate parents on open communication and talk to them about the importance of acceptance. Just think 2 kids could be alive today if parents just simply talked to them.  Kids and teens have enough to worry about lets make parents one less stresser.  If anyone needs to talk my DM'S are open.

I'm a mental health therapist and I think traveling is the most important way for me to stay mentally sharp and refreshed. My partner and I even made a travel channel to help others go on their own adventures.

Tell me why you think travel is or isn't important and give me some feedback on our channel.

"I need to leave Egypt, Im a bisexual man who lives in constant fear",ineedtoleaveegypt,ainbow,"Im 21 years old, I live with my middle class family with very abusive and very religious parents who are very strict and would quite literally kill me if ever dared to come out to them as bisexual, plus the enraged community I live in that would easily commit a crime and kill me in the name of their homophobic religion.

My parents made it clear several times that they would pick their religion over me anytime, and they dont mess around with that. 

Im tired of living in the closet, I want to explore the world and explore my sexuality freely, I want to be able to proudly tell people that Im bisexual without being so scared for my life. 

I have had an experience before with a guy but it was very discreet and we couldnt go through with it because of the very toxic community we live in, we had to just forget it for the sake of our lives. It was years ago.

I need to get out of here. Ive read somewhere that the US has some sort of an asylum program of some sorts, I want to know how to apply for that and if there is any fees that I have to pay considering if I ever proceed with this I will literally have no money at all. I want to also know if there is anything I can do right now, I need urgent help. I cant live like this anymore.

Thank you so much for understanding."
Update suicide and depression,bi_dad48,ainbow,If you read my post last night you know im a funeral director and worked yesterday to prepare a 13 year old boy for burial and met with his family to make the arrangements.  The boy and his boyfriend committed suicide because they believed they couldn't come out and be together.  They felt like death was the only way they could be together.  Well  I arrived at work just a few minutes ago to find out we're getting the other boy to.  I have since found out the family i met with had no idea their son was gay.  I don't know if they would have been supportive or not.  Same goes for this other boys family.  The good news someone else will prepare the other boy for burial the rough part is I have to meet with the family because we're doing a joint service.  I want so badly for them to honor the fact they were more than friends unfortunately I can't suggest it.  I can only help arrange what they want.  I can suggest they have a service that honors their boys in all aspects of their lives but can't specifically say including they were gay.  Hopefully they will.  Its just going to be another sad day knowing that two 13 year old boys could possibly still be alive today if parents and kids communicated more openly.  I have talked to my kids regularly as they grew letting them know that i loved them regardless of sexuality or gender.  My kids and I now talk openly about all aspects of their lives because we have the trust to do so.  We need a way to get parents and kids educated to the fact that they need to be talking to each other about their lives and about what they believe so kids know its safe to come out or not. Society today should not be as close minded as it is.  Yet kids and teens stress more about coming out and being accepted because of all the hate against LGBTQIA+ today.  They suffer instead of talking about it with their parents because they don't know what will happen if they do because their parents never talk about it.  Parents look at your beliefs about the lgbtqia community and ask yourself is it worth losing your child forever over the hate or do you love your child enough to accept them.  Please if you need someone to talk to and you cannot talk to your parents please my DM'S are open I will listen
I hate internalised homophobia. I am gay. What does this mean?,WeirdAlienEyes56,ainbow,"
hey everyone ;)
So Ive realised that I might have internalised homophobia. I dont like saying the word gay, part of me finds watching 2 men kiss uncomfortable but I have to remind myself - thats what you want in the future!!

I really hate this. I want to be comfortable with homosexuality. I feel like I dont properly associate with the term gay yet, which I blame on this as well. Im not sure how to deal with this. Any ideas?"

Suicide and depression,bi_dad48,ainbow,Y'all I usually don't post this stuff because I prefer to keep my posts as up beat as possible but i can't let this go unsaid.  Y'all my heart is breaking.  I don't usually tell what I do for a living but im a funeral director.  I have just embalmed and just met with a family whose 13 year old son and his boyfriend committed suicide together because they thought they wouldn't be accepted if they came out.  Both boys were depressed and scared to tell their parents how they felt.  They believed their family would disown them and they would be bullied at school.  Whether or not that would have been the case I don't know.  What I do know is 2 young men are dead because parents don't tell their kids they support whatever lifestyle they choose and support whomever they love.  2 boys felt death was their only hope of being together and I have never cried so hard in my life.  I can't imagine losing a child even to natural causes but today I kept seeing myself lying there because the only difference between me and them was an uncle took me on before I could.  The part that really broke me is i don't know what the parents know about what was in the note so I had to go in like I knew nothing.  I hope the service they planned honors his life but I fear his being LGBTQ will be left out.  We cannot keep losing are LGBTQ kids like this.  This is why im here its so if you're feeling like this we can talk maybe I can help.  I've called myself a virtual dad but hell I'll be whatever you need mom dad brother sister friend if it helps you.  Please my DM'S are open hmu.

A glimmer of hope,bi_dad48,ainbow,It does my heart good every time I see parents responding to their children coming out like they should.  I've made similar post before but to me this can't be shared enough.  Kids need to know not all parents will react badly.  Still kids you know your situation better than me so never come out if you know its not safe. I was at a local concert last night nothing special just one of those free local concerts some cities do in summer.  I saw a family with their son ( im saying son cause not sure if he's mtf or not) he was wearing dress makeup the whole nine yards.  Honestly I would have thought it was their daughter had i not heard others talking about how cool it was they were being supportive of him.  My heart melted even my kids teared up a little.  They were acting no different than they would if he was being traditional male.  If I had to guess the child was 12 or 13 give or take and was absolutely having a ball.  Honestly I never saw anyone give any sort of negative reaction.  It was an incredible evening.  I really think if parents could understand the anxiety and stress it takes to get up the courage to come out maybe they wouldn't be so harsh.  Sadly not every parent will react this way.  So again before you come out make sure you know its safe to do so.  For those of you who know your parents will react badly im here for you.  My DM'S are open I will be your virtual dad if you need to talk.
We should stop using phobic for things that aren't fears,BaymaxIsAllPowerful,ainbow,"We use terms like homophobic and biphobic for people who don't accept people who are homosexual, bi ect.
However, phobic means ""fear of"" therefore homophobia means ""fear of homosexuals"" sometimes people can be scared of what they don't understand but generally its a lack of tolerance which can even turn dangerous. I think that we should stop using the terms and change it to different words.
For example, in the past racism was called xenophobia but as people became somewhat more accepting, they realised that you cant describe intolerance as them being scared as it makes what the person in question is saying seem more ok when it is not. 
I would like some suggestions of what i can use instead of terms like homophobic since i dont think we should keep using it.

Just writing out my thoughts on figuring out my sexuality if anyone cares...,QuAzYhOoMaN,ainbow,"So, this post is just me getting my thoughts out about me and my sexual orientation puzzle. Btw, I am a cis female and in middle school. 

So at first I thought I was bi, since I had crushes on both girls and boys when I was younger (and still do). And I identify with a lot of the bisexual-like stereotypes/identifications, but in reality, does that matter as much as who I actually like? No. (But it still hurts cuz I feel so connected to the community and everything cuz I thought I was bi for like 3 yrs..) 

Then, for a while there, I identified as Omnisexual. (NO ITS NOT JUST PANSEXUAL! ITS SIMILAR BUT NOT THE SAME-) Then I kind of suppressed it because everyone I told (just friends and ppl online, but still) would say ""isn't that just pan"" and stuff and that made me feel invalidated, so I figured I should try and save myself and others time and energy and just force myself into being pansexual. (Now I realize I shouldn't have done this, but I still feel this way..) 

Then I thought I figured out what I was. At this point, I was identifying as a Bisexual Panromantic, since my reasoning was that I didn't feel attraction to non-binary people. I now realize that I in fact DO FEEL ATTRACTION (very strong attraction tbh) towards non-binary and they/them people, I just wasn't letting myself accept/express that. But now I can confidently say (in my head), ""Non- binary people are just...hot. They really are."" (THEY ARE OK-)

And tonight I am again questioning my sexuality. I have been debating whether I am bi or pan, and then ruled out bisexuality. That was when I saw something (on Pinterest) that mentioned Omnisexuality and made me feel slightly more validated, and I realized I might be Omnisexual, and maybe I just wasn't letting myself accept/express it. And after writing this I realize I shouldn't have suppressed my Omnisexuality just because some people couldn't /didn't care to understand it. 

So, I think I figured it out guys. For real this time. FUQ BISHES IM OMNISEXUAL! YEH GO ME! 

(If anyone is wondering what Omnisexuality is, its basically Pansexuality BUT WITH A TWIST. It's attraction to all genders, (just like pan), but the difference is gender does play a role in your attraction, whereas being Pansexual, you are essentially gender-blind, or at least your attraction is. Omnisexual people just happen to be attracted to all genders anyway.) It can be a bit confusing at first, but if you keep an open mind it should make sense at some point, and Omnisexuals need to feel validated. WE DO EXIST, AND WE ARE OUR SEPERATE SEXUALITY, NOT JUST PAN! GO O M N I S E X U A L S!"
I struggle with internalized judgment and still question myself to this day...,chobibi,ainbow,"I am concretely aware of some qualities I find attractive. The male body is not for me. I don't find myself attracted to male anatomy. But I still would like to be close to guys, just not in a sexual way at all. I get nervous around guys and I assume it comes from my sadness over never being sought after by guys throughout my life. They make me nervous in an awkward way. 

Girls, however, carry no doubt in my mind. I've always gravitated more toward girls throughout my life. I just didn't realize it until my sprout years (from when I questioned in 5th to being aware in 10th). I have a girlfriend right now. Things were lovely but I still catch myself wondering how things would be if I straight up liked guys. Things were lovely at first but I started to feel shame, guilt, that desire to be ""normal"". Nowadays I feel numb toward my relationship but that could also be my low place affecting me. 

Any tips for dealing with internalized judgment and/or internalized homophobia?"

It's been 5 years today...my City Beautiful was attacked.,HawkeyeFLA,ainbow,"Today marks the 5 year anniverary of the Pulse shooting.  5 long, crazy years.

I still cannot visit the memorial site.  For the first several months afterwards, I would drive out of my way to even avoid driving past.

By 2016, I wasn't really going out clubbing like I used to, so I hadn't been to the club in ages, but still have so many great memories from when I would go.

I've been on dates that ended up there.  I've spent plenty of time oogling the go-go bois with friends.  At one point I did special event photography for them.

That late night early morning 5 years ago, I was still awake and online chatting with friends when I saw a friend post a comment on FB about seeing something going on and people running across the street and talk of gun shots.

Then the well known ""get out"" Tweet from the club's offiical twitter.

Even then, the full scope of what happened wasn't known for several hours.  

I remember non-stop refreshing of my Facebook feed trying to find anyone, anything posted to comment on it.  

Non-stop refreshing of local news sites, nothing.

Around 4am or so, maybe a little later, it finally hit on The BBC.  Mass shooting event in Orlando at a popular LGBT night club.

By this point, numbness started setting in.

More news.  Stand offs.  Breeching explsoives used.

About 530am, finally the local news station got an anchor on air and started talking about it.

We still didn't know what was really what.  

One week after Gay Days.  My City Beautiful was attacked.

In the weeks after, I saw this city truly live up to its nickname.

To this day, I still cannt visit the site.  It's just too visceral for me.  So I sit at a little bar I know near by, having a beer and drinking a toast to our 49.  And to the survivors.  And to all the first responders and medical staff that performed herculean tasks.

We are Orlando.  We are the City Beautiful.

We are Orlando United.  We are One Pulse.  We Are.

To quote John Oliver from his show that aired the very evening after the early morning event.

&gt;And in Orlando early this morning a gunman attacked a Latin night at a gay club in the theme park capital of the world. And for the record, I will happily embrace a Latin night at a gay club in the theme park capital of the world as the ultimate symbol of what is truly wonderful about America."

15M I need help with my 16F Questioning GF,flyterog,ainbow,"Hey guys, 

as the title says, im a 15 YO straight guy, and am dating my GF who is bi and 16F, and she is questioning if she is lesbian. Hopefully the post below can help you guys try and figure out what is going on?

(Ive posted it on a few other subs as though im trying to gain some perspective)

Me and my gf have been dating for a year next Friday. We are each others first everything, we have done everything together,  and we have spent pretty much every chance we get together. I know she is bisexual, with more so a preference to girls, but that doesn't bother me, as though I know she is still both physically and mentally attracted. What has bothered me is that 2 weeks ago, she told me that she is questioning if she is lesbian. (I have nothing against LGBT+, and one of my close friends is even Trans M to F) She said it was 60% she wasn't, but 40% she is, and then told me she knows she isn't lesbian, and just bi.  But, recently she has been extremely distant, where 3 weeks ago we were sleeping over together on the couch, and even took a road trip together last month, to where yesterday when I went over that morning to grab my keys from the night before, I went to go and give her a hug and kiss, she avoided me completely, and turned the other way. I ate breakfast next to her, but when I tried to even hold her hand, she turned to me and said no firmly. And what finally sealed the deal is that she changed her discord profile picture to the lesbian flag. I talked to her sister about it, and she said that my GF just told her the same thing I was told, she was questioning. I know it seems so insignificant, and that I may be overthinking like crazy, but it just has me worried. I texted her this morning saying hey gfs name, is everything ok? you dont have to tell me everything, just know that i am here to help and listen, and that i will not judge or get mad or anything. i will listen and be supportive no matter what &lt;3 Can you guys please help me out, I really dont want to and cant lose her, she means too much to me, and plain and simply, im in love with her."
The Economist - A backlash against gender ideology is starting in universities Academics are speaking up against the stifling of debate,billyfieldsbadhabits,ainbow,"Interested in views.


The Economist, 5 June 2021

Hours before Jo Phoenix, a professor of criminology at Britains Open University, was due to give a talk at Essex University about placing transgender women in womens prisons, students threatened to barricade the hall. They complained that Ms Phoenix was a transphobe likely to engage in hate speech. A flyer with an image of a gun and text reading shut the fuck up, terf (trans-exclusionary radical feminist, a slur) was circulating. The university told Ms Phoenix it was postponing the event. Then the sociology department asked her for a copy of her talk. Days later it told her it had voted to rescind its invitation, and would issue no more. Ms Phoenix says she was absolutely furious and deeply upset about both the damage to her reputation and to academic freedom.

Essex Universitys vice-chancellor asked Akua Reindorf, a lawyer who specialises in employment and discrimination law, to investigate. Eighteen months later, in mid-May, the university published Ms Reindorfs report on its website. It said Essex had infringed Ms Phoenixs right to freedom of expression and that its decision to exclude and blacklist her was also unlawful. It advised the university to apologise to Ms Phoenix and to Rosa Freedman, a professor of law at Reading University whom it had excluded from an event during Holocaust Memorial Week because of her views on gender identity. (Essex in the end allowed Ms Freedman to attend.)

Ms Reindorfs report marks a challenge to the transgender dogma that originated on American campuses and has spread to universities around the English-speaking world. Its proponents hold that gender identitythe feeling that one is a man or a womanis as important as biological sex and that trans people should in all circumstances be regarded as the gender with which they identify. This has increasingly influenced policy-makers: several places allow trans women into spaces that were once reserved for females, from sports teams to prisons and shelters for victims of domestic violence.

The opposing viewpoint, which is often described as gender-critical, might once have been considered mainstream. It argues that, since biological sex is unchangeable, even with hormones, surgery or any other form of treatment, the conviction that one has been born in the wrong body should not be dispositive. Gender critics argue that biological differences between the sexes make the continued provision of female-only spaces necessary. Trans activists say that trans women should have access to those places, too. The emphasis that so-called gender-critical women place on what they describe as threats to women ignores the fact that trans women are overwhelmingly those who are threatened in single-sex spaces, says Lisa Miracchi, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has signed open letters disapproving of gender-critical feminists.

The arguments the two sides put forward, in other words, are complex and debatable. But many trans activists think that any disagreement is tantamount to hate speech and try to suppress it. Some universities with policies that reflect the belief that trans women are women have acted on complaints about people who do nothing more than express a contrary view. In May, after students at Abertay University in Dundee reported that a student had said at a seminar that women have vaginas and men are stronger, the university launched an investigation.

In some cases, academics who have objected to gender ideologythe view that gender identity should trump biologyhave been removed from professional posts. In April Callie Burt, an associate professor at Georgia State University, was fired from the editorial board of Feminist Criminology. She was told her presence might deter others from submitting manuscripts. The problem appears to have been her criticism of the conflation of sex and gender identity in proposed anti-discrimination legislation. Last June Kathleen Lowrey, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, was removed as the chair of an undergraduate programme after students complained they felt unsafe. She says she reckons gender-critical posters on her office door were to blame.

Yet the most worrying effect is likely to be invisible. An unknown number of university employees avoid expressing their opinion for fear it will damage their career or turn them into pariahs. The report about Essex says witnesses described a culture of fear among those with gender-critical views. This is unlikely to be limited to one university. The report also argues that expressing the view that trans women are not women is not hate speech and is not illegal under British law, whatever university policies might suggest.

**The fight back**

The report is likely to embolden gender-critical academics in Britain, at least, where they are already more outspoken. There are signs that a backlash to gender ideology is building elsewhere, too. In February, when Donna Hughes, a professor of womens studies at Rhode Island University, published an article critical of gender ideology, petitions sprouted calling for her to be fired. Her university denounced her and warned that the right to free speech was not boundless. Ms Hughes, who is a co-founder of the Academic Freedom Alliance (afa), which was launched in March, says her university encouraged students to file complaints. She hired an aggressive lawyer. In May the afa announced the university had dropped its investigations into Ms Hughes and affirmed her right to speak.

Ms Hughess example is striking because in America, where concerns about free speech in universities tend to focus on racial sensitivities, gender-critical views are rarely expressed publicly. This is partly because there is no federal legislation that specifically protects trans (or gay) people from discrimination, which lends a particular urgency to lgbt activism. Jami Taylor, a professor of political science at the University of Toledo and a trans woman, says she has experienced transgender-related bias throughout her career, from being called it by students and a colleague to being guided to the mens bathroom.

Americas political polarisation makes it harder yet to debate such topics. Trans activists often portray gender criticism as a far-right cause. Though it is becoming that, too, it is a topic on which leftist feminists and social conservatives find agreement. In Britain most outspoken gender-critical academics are left-leaning, atheist feminists. Some in America are, too.

Their chief concern is the preservation of female-only spaces. In February Holly Lawford-Smith, a professor of philosophy at the University of Melbourne, launched a website (noconflicttheysaid.org) which invited women to describe their experiences of sharing female-only spaces with trans women. It is not a research project and its reports are unverified. Most describe a feeling of discomfort rather than any form of physical assault. Soon afterwards, around 100 of her colleagues signed an open letter claiming the website promoted harmful ideology. It called for swift and decisive action by the university. Ms Lawford-Smith kept her job, but there have been at least two marches at the university decrying that. I think people quite enjoy having a nemesis on campus, she says.

How did an ideology that brooks no dissent become so entrenched in institutions supposedly dedicated to fostering independent thinking? Pressure groups have played a big part. In Britain most universities and many public-sector bodies have joined the Stonewall Diversity Champions scheme, which means they have drawn up policies that reflect the groups position on trans identity. The report about Essex said the universitys policy states the law as Stonewall would prefer it to be, rather than the law as it is, and could cause the university to break the law by indirectly discriminating against women. It recommended that Essex reconsider its relationship with Stonewall. Several bodies, including the governments equality watchdog, have since left the Champions scheme.


The influence of pressure groups exemplifies the other big reason trans ideology has gained a foothold in academia: its elision with the rights of gay people. Many organisations established to defend gay rights have morphed into trans-rights groups. Tamsin Blaxter, a research fellow at Gonville &amp; Caius College, Cambridge and a trans woman, says that academia has become a lot more welcoming to trans people, thanks largely to Stonewall. But some gay people disagree with its new focus. In 2019 some supporters split from the group, in part owing to concerns that its stance encourages gay people to redefine themselves as trans (and straight), to form the lgb Alliance. Similar groups have sprung up around the world.

Students increasingly express gender-critical views. This year a group of feminist students in Cambridge ran a replatforming event for gender-critical scholars who had been excluded from academic events (Ms Phoenix was among the speakers). Sophie Watson, one of the organisers, says she has lost friends over the issue. Theres so much fear over using the wrong languageto disagree with the line that trans women are women is really considered hateful, she says.

**Campus revolt**

Gender-critical academics hope that as more of them speak out, others who share their concerns but were afraid to express them will feel emboldened. When Kathleen Stock, a professor of philosophy at Sussex University and one of Britains most prominent gender-critical academics, was given a government award for services to education last December, hundreds of academics from around the world signed an open letter denouncing her. More than 400 signed a counter letter in her defence. But many people, she says, prefer to express their support privately.

Universities will no doubt watch how the debate evolves outside academia, especially in the courts. The dangers of eroding free speech are becoming increasingly apparent as judges rule on matters from the medical treatment of trans-identifying children to people who have been sacked after being accused of transphobia. If Maya Forstater, a British researcher who lost her job because of her gender-critical views, wins her appeal against the ruling of an employment tribunal that this was lawful, universities may become quicker to defend their gender-critical employees.

Regulation may also play a part. In February the British government announced proposals to strengthen academic freedom at universities, including the appointment of a free-speech champion. Some (though not all) gender-critical academics welcome the idea. In America lawsuits invoking free speech may make a difference. But it would be better if universities, which owe their success to a tradition of dissent and debate, did in fact defend it."

TW: Not everyone is celebrating,bi_dad48,ainbow,"You ever wondered why if pride is a time we celebrate all the accomplishment and achievements the community has made throughout the years, that it seems like not everyone is celebrating.  I mean we put on our pride gear have our parades and really celebrate.  Unfortunately not everyone in the community is as enthusiastic about celebrating as others.  Some countries can't even celebrate at all.  For those of us who can lets be aware some are still hurting during this time.  So many of us lost family and friends when we came out.  Some were made homeless at young ages.  Elder LGBTQ members lost friends and partners to AIDS or beaten to death by hate groups.  Lets make an effort to make sure everyone is celebrating rather than assuming and lets comfort those who are hurting.  I know a lot in my friend group don't go to the parades and all its just hard for them to celebrate the losses.  I do my best to comfort them but I also focus on the younger LGBTQ not necessarily in age but being new to the community as well.  I like to be a virtual parent or dad since im a dad in real life as well.  So anyone missing their parents and needing to talk im here.  If you need a hug or shoulder to cry on im here.  Need advice or want to share about coming out im here.  We all need pride month some to celebrate others to help heal.  Whatever your reason happy pride."
Why pride is hurting me and I avoid the lgbtq+ 'community' and hide my identity.,Cerwen5,ainbow,"quite simply, words hurt. especially when you were raised in the 80s like me and saw people beat half to death with the words ""dirty queer"" being shouted. It took me 30 years to work out that I'm actually T, I, B, and partially Demi. trying to deal with my reality has been a struggle and I still find it hard to accept that I might be attracted to men. then I see so much in the media and people throwing around the word 'queer' to describe a group i supposedly 'belong' to? I find that incredibly hostile, hurtful and isolating.  why are people so okay with this? I had another trans woman directly call me tr**ny to my face and it felt like a gut punch. this violence towards me just makes me want to either hide under a rock, or sometimes just stick a rope round my neck.

I respect people's right to reclaim a word for themselves, if they find it empowering then I'm glad for them. I do not find it empowering, quite the opposite. it strips me of any power and makes me feel like i have no allies. especially now the mass media is starting to use this term as if it never hurt anyone. 

so many of us have known suffering through our lives and I  honestly expected some kind of empathy from other LGBTQ+ people. but these days I feel more excluded than ever. the term 'queer' makes me feel just as isolated and broken and disgusting and excluded as it did when it was used by straight people in the 80s, except now it's the lgbtq people that are doing it to me. so please don't say happy pride month to me, it is anything but happy for me these days."

is there ever an end to struggling with my sexuality?,Cute-Can2408,ainbow,"sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, but i'm desperate. my situation is a weird one. i know exactly what i am. i've known that i've been exclusively attracted to girls from a pretty young age. that much isn't questionable. but i was outed before i was ready to come back (only to my parents) and i've struggled with accepting my sexuality entirely since. there are some people i can happily admit to being a lesbian towards, but it's a very minor few... multiple times i've had people ask me directly if i'm a lesbian and i can't say yes? i always find a way to divert the conversation or outright deny it. and there have been moments where i've looked at a guy, thought he was attractive, and wondered if i WAS a lesbian. when i know i am. is this normal? does this ever end?"

 Though I'm in a happy heterosexual relationship currently, I feel like I could date someone of the same sex if I wasn't happily taken.. but I feel like I'm almost not gay enough.. like it may seem that I'm moving into someone else's territory. Would I be overstepping or undermining the LGBTQ+ community? Thoughts or opinions?"
Euphoria,bi_dad48,ainbow,Its amazing how little things can mean the most when you're questioning your sexuality and gender.  Every trans male and female im sure have days where they get down and out because they just don't know if they're passable while waiting on HRT or surgery.  My nephew who lives with me is finally being able to explore his feelings to see who he really is.  He's not sure if Hes trans or just gender fluid.  Hes been experimenting with makeup and clothes and really enjoys it but wasn't sure he passed.  Today he got made up put on a dress and we went out shopping.  While at the mall he got 4 phone numbers from guys.  Legit interested in him they thought he was a female.  He did explain he was a male and 3 of the guys were bi and super interested.  I have never seen him so happy.  See as family or friends we can tell you fall day long you pass but you feel we're supposed to.  When strangers do it you know its real.  He's in his room now Snapchatting with them.  All it takes is one person to prove you pass and it makes your whole day.  I know its a struggle for my trans family out there waiting on HRT and surgery but keep pushing keep working and being yourself you indeed are passing.

[IMPORTANT] Help the Russian AIDS Center,Revolutionary_Utena,ainbow,"Parni PLUS, Russia's biggest LGBTQ-website, has been working since 2012 and dealing with the HIV epidemic among MSM. Every year 3,000,000 users visit Parni PLUS. The portal's publications cover the topics of health, relationships, lives and lifestyles of LGBTQ people.
On 1 December 2020, against the will of its creators and editors, Russia's Ministry of Justice included the portal into the register of foreign agents, i.e. the list of organisations involved in political activity and receiving funds from abroad.
On 20 May 2021, we, the Parni PLUS team, were fined for refusing to comply with the decision of the Ministry of Justice and for insisting that they cannot be treated as foreign agents because in fact they are not involved in any political activity. We have taken legal action and have filed a lawsuit against the government. We are fully aware we are bound to lose the case but it is a matter of principle for us.
After the website was included into the foreign agent registry, it was unlawfully banned by Roskomnadzor, Russia's Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media which is the Russian federal executive body responsible for compliance with the law in media and telecommunications. In April, we managed to fight Roskomnadzor's decision in court and to get the website working again. However, after that we started receiving threats from far-right activists and unknown individuals who demand we shut down the website, otherwise they will cause us physical harm.
Right now we have to raise 300,000 roubles (4500 USD) by the end of July in order to continue working as a LGBTQ media outlet. Right now one more independent media outlet in Russia is at risk of extinction. Right now a reliable and vital source of information for Russian LGBTQ people is on the verge of dying out.

I'm confused about my identity and orientation.,Lexi-Rhodes,ainbow,"I have been trying to define myself for a while now and find myself confused and unsure what I am, in a limbo of identity.

Regarding gender. I am AMAB and have lived my life so far identifying as male, as I didn't know people could be outside of the binary other than genetically intersex people. However over the last few years, after escaping narcissistic abusive parents, I have come to find that I am not a stereotypical man and have never been, I just kept the other stuff secret and to myself, eg I would like to wear make up sometimes but wouldn't as that's not for men etc. I suppose if we took all limitations out of the situation my ideal reality would be I could morph my body daily to fit the clothing and identity I wish to wear that day. In reality though I maintain a 'masculine' appearance for simplicity with an occasional longing that maybe one day it'll be easier for me to express differently. I have considered from time to time I may be trans but I'm not entirely sure. 

Regarding sexuality. My relationship history would suggest I am straight as I have only been with women, however there is a part of me that is interested in sex with men but not so much into the idea of a relationship with men, or at least I haven't met I man I could be in a relationship with, however the confusing thing is in my head, if I was to identify as or even transition to female, I could possibly see myself in a relationship with a man.

If anyone can offer advise that would be great, this also mostly hypothetical, I am happily married, to a woman, with children. I just want to be able to identify myself better because straight or bi man doesn't feel right. 

Regarding pronouns I am happy with he/him them/they she/her"

"Is it ok for me, a 21-year-old, to date an 18-year-old?",Altruistic_Garage926,ainbow," I'm a 20-year-old rising college sophomore, turning 21 in August. I'm gay.

Last fall, I met this guy (let's call him Tom), a rising high school senior, who attends a school near my college. Tom and I became friends, and I've grown to absolutely love him to bits. I've liked people before, but no one has ever made me feel as happy as I do around him. I love spending time with him, I love talking with him, I love being involved with his life, and recently we both expressed interest in each other.

The problem is, he's 17 (turning 18 early next year). That's a nearly 3-1/2 year age gap, and I'm worried it's too much. I'm considering waiting a few months until he's 18, and entering a relationship with him. A relationship would be legal in our state now, but I think waiting a few months couldn't hurt, and I think he deserves a few months to think and be sure of what he wants.

I've never felt the age gap. I suffered abuse and social isolation as a teenager, and so I'm perhaps less socially mature than others my age. On the other hand, he seems more socially mature than most guys his/our age. I never feel the cognitive dissonance I feel when talking to someone that's younger or older or more/less mature than I am.

I know things could be complicated with each of us at different schools, but I'm willing to put up with that. It doesn't feel like putting up with anything, in fact. I'm interested in listening to him, and what's going on in his life. I don't mind putting in the effort. I didn't have much socialization as a child or teenager, and I love having it now. I want to be involved in his life.

I'm so confused. I've had responses range from I'm a ""garden-variety pedophile"" to ""don't wait, go for it now"". I don't know what's right. If only he were just a year older, no one would blink an eye. I could hold him and everything would be ok :(

I don't know what to do. I know what I want to do, but I'm not sure if it's right. Please help :("

Working up the courage to come out,doverthecat,ainbow,"Ive made posts both here and in r/lgbt about my struggle with deciding whether or not to come out (Im 14, a lesbian and on the aro spectrum, though Id only be coming out as a lesbian). Ive decided I want to come out to my dad, namely because he is currently staying in another city for work and wont be home until mid-July. Ill be staying with him for a weekend in a few weeks and plan on telling him then. Im certain he will accept me, as most of his students and many of his friends are queer and he has never had any problem with it. I dont have any doubt my mom would accept me, though Im worried about her telling people and my town isnt the most liberal. My dad isnt a sharer and I doubt he would tell anyone even if I didnt stress to him not to (which I will). Im scared both about breaking my moms trust in me, since Ive always told her things first and of my dad telling my mom. I have to tell someone in my family, but I need advice on how to stop stressing about it and build up the courage to do it, or Im scared Ill chicken out."

TW: Tough life,bi_dad48,ainbow,Being LGBTQIA+ wherever you fall in there is tough.  Its frustrating at times and scary and sometimes you just need a mom or dad our friends to say hey what's wrong tell me about it. We all need that affirmation that love.  Sadly though a lot of LGBTQ kids and teens and young adults  don't get that.  They're either homeless or their parents and friends don't support them.  I was kicked out at 14 for coming out as bi.  I knew I liked everyone regardless of their gender.  Yet I needed guidance.  How foolish I was to assume my parents would love me regardless.  They dent me packing without anything but what I was wearing.  For months I was homeless until I found an uncle who took me in.  There were nights on the streets I wanted to yell at my parents and there were nights I just wanted a hug.  There were nights I was glad they kicked me out and nights I would have went back without hesitation if they'd wanted me.  This life is not a life we choose.  We don't want to be bullied and laughed at but its who we are and we need people we can talk to.  So if you need to talk im a virtual parent.  You can talk to me about whatever it is you can't talk to your parents or friends about.  I'll listen when life's hard and help however I can.  My DM'S are open

I have just one question.  Why?   If you have a picture or outfit or look that you post about that makes you happy or makes you feel cute or whatever DO NOT DELETE IT!  You use that as a reminder of your goals.  Use it to pick yourself up when your down.  Use it to help you in the dark times when your parents are not listening or not wanting to accept you.  Use it to remind yourself you're valid in your feelings.  Use it to remind you that what you see is where your heading.  Even if its not exactly where you want to be its a starting point for progress.  Use it to your advantage to silence the haters and rise above it.  Never delete anything that makes a positive feeling for you.  We need all the encouragement and positive thinking we can get.  Unless you have a legitimate chance that someone who shouldn't see it will then delete it otherwise leave it alone."

Questioning my identity,MechanicalWolf_,ainbow,"Hey there.   
I hope this is an appropriate place to post this, but I'm looking for some advice or thoughts from others in this situation/have been through this. I'll try and keep it fairly brief but I'm happy to expand on it :) 

Biologically I'm female. I've never really conformed to gender norms though, as a kid I would have been considered a tomboy. I just accepted being female but always wore unisex clothing, just doing what I wanted without considering gender.   
But, I've come to realise I don't really feel female. But I don't think that means I feel male either.   
I don't particularly like my body, specifically my chest. I've always worn sports bra to try and constrict it, so to speak, but I don't think I was always aware I was doing that. 

I guess what I am trying to say is, I don't feel like I strongly identify with a gender? But honestly I could just be uneducated and what I'm feeling is just normal? I think I'm confused further as I identify as asexual, I don't experience sexual attraction. I guess the best way to describe it is I just feel empty. (Which I know is wrong, I do feel romantic attraction, so there is something there).   


So, to others who have/are questioning your identity, how do you go about figuring it out? Any advice?"

Can you debunk these anti-gay claims please?,Correct-Baseball9464,ainbow,"The questions raised in this post are by no means an attack on being gay itself. But to find a direction when confused (the post is long, but please bear with me). Having argued with a few anti-gay individuals for some time now, they have made a series of incendiary claims, such as: 1- ""gay people are not as physically and mentally healthy as straight people, gay people are more likely to be mentally ill and use drugs and alcohol"",

2- ""gay people can not live as long as straight people"",

3- ""two men or two women can not possibly love each other, what they feel is not love. Love can only happen between a man and a woman"",

4- ""two men or two women can not form a healthy, long-lasting relationship. Only a man and a woman can, because men and women evolved to complement each other. Even the roles men and women fulfill complement each other, like locks and keys do. Two locks or two keys can not complement each other, two men or two women can not either"",

And lastly,

5- ""kids need a mother and a father. Two men or two women can not raise a physically and mentally healthy kid, just as kids raised by single parents are more likely to be mentally ill, use drugs and alcohol, commit crimes, etc"".

Can you debunk those claims?

What evidence is there that: 1- gay people are as (physically and mentally) healthy as (if not healthier than) ""straight"" people?

2- two men or two women are capable of loving and complementing each other, and forming healthy, long-lasting relationships as much as (if not more than) ""a man and a woman"" do?

3- people in gay relationships are as happy and healthy as (if not happier and healthier than) people in ""straight"" relationships?

4- kids raised by ""two mothers"" or ""two fathers"" are as healthy as (if not healthier than) kids raised by ""a mother and a father""?

I bring the last one up because YouTube has been recommending irrelevant videos to me, one of which was a Katy Faust video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V73Y1HsDKWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V73Y1HsDKWs)

Kate Faust was raised by lesbian parents and appears to be in Australia to lobby against gay marriage.

Here are some of her other videos: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trQamMcGncw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trQamMcGncw)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq-\_2dh6JLk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq-_2dh6JLk)

The comments underneath the second video are anti-divorce:

&gt;What she said is true, when my mom and dad divorced it rocked my siblings and I.  And when she remarried, we were resentful.  My wife and I will NEVER divorce.  I'm also very grateful to a wonderful Godly wife.  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh my goodness.  Now I know why I feel so happy when I see my parents being kind and affectionate with each other...  
&gt;  
&gt;Also dont put childrens rights before parents. The younger generation has an unhealthy sense of entitlement, and ingratitude. In many cases, they are just waiting for parents to die. All should be in balance.

In this video, Katy says kids go through health issues when their ""biological mothers and fathers"" are separated from them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfBI9F8e-bA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfBI9F8e-bA)

&gt;Children who lose a relationship with their biological parent through divorce, abandonment, do not fare as well. Outcomes for these groups are incredibly diminished. Children suffer trauma right when they lose a relationship with one or both of their parents. We actually have studies that say that children who have experienced father loss due to abandonment, incarceration, etc, have shorter telomeres. The end caps of their chromosomes are smaller because they lost a relationship with their father and the final thing that we know is that non biological adults are not as connected to, protective of and invested in children and that is another reason why we have high standards for adoptive parents. Now when we're not talking about \[gay\] parents sociologists agree on all of those things so isn't it strange that all four of those factors are at work in \[gay\] households and we have these studies that say that there's no difference? It's probably because the methodology behind those studies was flawed ...

In this video, Katy says again that kids need ""mothers and fathers"": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHE62YXXcW4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHE62YXXcW4)

&gt;For us, the public purpose of marriage is not to investigate how deeply you love and care about somebody else. The public purpose of marriage is to connect men and women together when they're making babies, because those babies fare best if they're raised by both the man and woman that create them. When one of them is gone, primarily the father, then the child suffers and as a result society suffers, so the public purpose of marriage is incentivizing men to commit to the women they're making babies with so that those babies rights and well-being are protected

In this video, Katy says though the ideal is ""straight couples adopting and taking the kids in orphanages"", if no ""straight couples"" are available, then it's better if the kid is taken by gay couples: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPYt6X91yN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPYt6X91yN8)

Having searched for the words ""Katy Faust"" on reddit, this thread came up: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/36g8lt/a\_child\_deserves\_a\_mother\_and\_father\_what\_does/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/36g8lt/a_child_deserves_a_mother_and_father_what_does/)

In the comments, someone explains the anti-gay ""position"": [https://imgur.com/bmIl6KQ](https://imgur.com/bmIl6KQ)

&gt;The father is the provider and the authority, while the mother is caregiver and housekeeper. In the ideal family dynamic, they would model these roles for their children.  
&gt;  
&gt;A lack of one of these roles leaves the children without a role model, an example of how that gender should act. The idea is that this is bad for the child.  
&gt;  
&gt;To some extent, the data backs them up. In the case of single parent families, there seems to be [a pretty huge body of data](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235202001915)[ supporting](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4227387?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21106883275243) the view that single-parent families are bad for children. Children raised by single parents are more likely to commit crimes and be sent to juvenile detention institutions, to use alcohol and experiment with drugs, have higher rates of teen pregnancy, etc.

There is data on kids doing terribly as a result of being raised in single ""parent"" households. ""Latchkey kids in families with both parents working still fare better \[than kids in single-parent families\]"", someone claimed.

Another claimed that they ""suffered"" because their ""father"" left and they had no proper ""masculine"" role model at home.

Multiple articles have been written on ""kids faring better with both mothers and fathers around"", as it ""delivers the most stability"": [https://ifstudies.org/blog/when-it-comes-to-child-well-being-is-one-parent-the-same-as-two](https://ifstudies.org/blog/when-it-comes-to-child-well-being-is-one-parent-the-same-as-two)

&gt;messages like one parent is *just as good* as two, or ""married parents aren't necessary"" are misleading and harmful. Not only does this view of family discount the experiences of men and women, like me, who grew up in loving but broken unmarried families, it also ignores the social science evidence on the best family structure for child well-being.

If kids really fare worse in ""single-parent"" households, then does that mean they do worse when raised by ""two mothers"" or ""two fathers"" as well?

Or is there evidence to the contrary?"

Monogamish and Coming Out to Myself(?),abmomma,ainbow," &lt;Long Post&gt; \*Names changed for anonymity

So me (***23 het cisF -Olivia\****) and my husband ***(25 fluid cisM- Thomas\****) have been friends for 12 years and married for 2, with a toddler. We have discussed our openness to sexuality and are both very accepting of all preferences (our motto is ""Whatever makes you feel good"". We've talked for years about threesomes and other partners but it never turned into anything more than talk.

Until recently, when I opened up to him about feelings I've had for a very long time (honestly as long as I've been dating) but am just now coming to realize. I told him I didn't know, but the best word I can use to describe it is ""polyamorous"" (or maybe polysexual? IDK). After a long and deep convo, we both agreed that we would like to explore other sexual encounters together, but wanted to prioritize our marriage and only want to be IN LOVE with each other. So we decided to open our monogamous marriage to a third. We started vetting and found this guy (***25 fluid cisM Jake\****) that I met through an app. We've talked for a while now and all of us have really hit it off. He's the type of guy we would want to be in our friend group. He meshes well with our personalities and is respectful of our marriage and the responsibilities that come with being parents. (We are not in any formal arrangement at the moment- still trying to hash it out). Well, we have invited him to a platonic dinner this weekend, and if all goes well, he'll come over to our house next week for a group session\*.\*

All of us have been on the same page since day one and everyone thinks we are going to be good friends for a while, who occasionally have sex together as a group (nothing wrong with that!)

**However,** recently the topic of hanging out separately came up (me and Jake or Thomas and Jake). Would Thomas and I be comfortable with having sexual sessions (or platonic hangouts) without everyone present? The answer...No. None of us have a problem with this- with boundaries of course. Also- Jake doesn't seem to have an interest in being in an involved relationship with us (so just remaining friends). And I have to say- all three of us are VERY excited to start this adventure!

But this has left me with a weird feeling where I'm questioning my own sexuality and relationship structure. It has nothing to do with being uncomfortable with it, but what *IS* it? Are we a triad? A throuple? A married couple dating another person? A married couple who has a mutual FWB? **What is this called?????**

So I guess what I'm asking is...

1. Would this be considered polyamory? (since Thomas and I want to keep our emotional intimacy monogamous- I thought polyamory implied a mandatory emotional component)
2. To go along with the previous, do poly arrangements like this exist or is it considered something else?
3. Can anyone give me advice on how to go down this exploration journey? I've always been an ally but don't have much experience or knowledge of the queer or non-normative community? How does one reconcile having to change your view on yourself (even when there's no guilt or shame)?

I've always considered myself a cis-het woman who was just kinky, but now that I've done some soul searching and research, I'm realizing that's not all it is and I might just be a bit queer ...and that's a little daunting. Not because it's a problem, but because it challenges the way I've always seen myself.

Well, that's it. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk. Advice and encouragement are welcomed."

I will be your virtual parent,bi_dad48,ainbow,Too many people on here young and older like me lost the relationship with their parents when they came out or know their parents are not supportive and can't talk to them.  The majority of us have a desire within us to turn to our parents with good news and bad. What can you do though if they don't support you oh have kicked you out.  It finally dawned on me after my last post because my desire is to help people but how can i effectively do it.  This is how I can be your virtual parent.  I can't give hugs to everyone because we don't all live in the same area but I can be your dad in other ways.  I can listen and give advice.  I can support you in all you do.  I can be there when you come out.  I can maybe teach you things and help you learn from mistakes.  Whatever it is you wish your parents would do but want because of homophobia or because they were never there to begin with I will be there for you.  No one should do this alone.  We are a community so if you need a dad then dammit im your dad now.  You message me and we will figure out whatever it is you need.  My DM'S are open here anytime you need me.

Reddit Gifts cancels PRIDE exchange,bluenowait,ainbow,"Earlier today, Reddit gifts started a signups for the third wave of gift exchanges of the year. Some of the themed exchanges available for users to sign up for are Diaries, Olympics, Board Games, and Stickers. Noticebley absent is the PRIDE exchange that was previously scheduled for signups today. Over on the official Reddit Gifts subreddit /r/SecretSanta many were wondering what happened to the presumably LGBTQ+ themed event, but the only explanation from the team was Sorry :/. There have also been some claiming that /r/SecretSanta mods have been deleting posts about the PRIDE exchange, but a few still stay up.

Im really disappointed in this, I was just starting to really get involved with these exchanges and was looking forward to the PRIDE exchange most of all. I was looking forward to sending someone cool gifts like fashion, books, etc. Now Im conflicted if I even want to participate at all in any exchange. What really pisses me off about this is that they created an image that listed the upcoming exchanges for the year, the Olympics exchange was listed as a maybe, while PRIDE was listed in all caps without any other notes. Really disappointed in the Reddit Gifts team right now."

What we miss,bi_dad48,ainbow,I have been seeing a lot of women wearing pride shirts that say free mom hugs.  First let me say that's amazing.  I was kicked out as a child and would have loved parental figures especially mom to get hugs from.  Something about a hug from mom made things better.  I wonder though if a dad could do the same thing and it not be viewed as being creepy.  I hope im wrong but I  was thinking though what would the dad equivalent be.  I mean certainly a dad hug is good to but you don't want to tread on moms territory.  Maybe free dad advice or free help from dad to check my car out or free fishing with dad something.  My kids and I were talking about it they said free dad jokes.  That's good unless your not funny then eh.  In all seriousness what it is it especially from an unsupportive parent you miss most.  Mom hugs I get I miss them to but what else from mom and especially what from dad.  Lets face it even if they don't support us there's things we miss.  Im curious during pride month and even after how this dad and others can help.

How do you handle friends or family forcing you to come out?,JK1104,ainbow,"So Im going to try to keep this short. Im a 25 year old AMAB. Ive struggled my entire life with severe dysphoria, but outside of expressing concerns about my body Ive kept extremely closeted about it. Im married to a cis woman who Ive known since high school. Ive expressed some things openly like I wish I was born a woman, life would be so much easier as a woman, and I try to incorporate things in my life that make me happy like wearing minimal woman clothing (hoodies and cut shirts). Ive spent my whole life sickened at the thought of living up to my assigned gender role. Im a veteran and spent 4 years in the marine corps with a combat deployment to iraq. Ive always given everything Ive had but never felt like I fit in with the guys. I dont want to be a protector, to be strong, or fight. I used to be someone from a traditional household that didnt understand the community. I thought everything was just a choice and what I was experiencing was just normal, but I was wrong. In recent years since leaving the military I reflected on my childhood experiences, developed more with my expression having more freedom, and searched hard for labels that fit how I was feeling. I wanted somewhere to feel safe even if it was in secret. I ultimately decided I was genderfluid as I dont currently feel like one gender. Im constantly havent feelings of changing on the day. Mostly like 60% female, 20% neither, and the rest male if I averaged how I felt together (speaking about gender). Idk if Im actually trans or non-binary. I have no issues with my genitalia, just my gender so I would never wish to have an operation. I dont think I could ever pass. 

Now for the reason for this post. I accidentally told my wife in an argument I had over not wanting to have sex very frequently as to me having problems with my identity. Now she is bothering me when Im not ready to talk about it. She says shes scared of what it means and thinks she has a right to know. Im scared, confused, and not ready to come out. 

Im sorry this is so long, but I feel like I can only talk about this here."

Do I even matter?,bi_dad48,ainbow,Has anyone told you today that you matter? Because you do.  Everything you do matters and counts for something.  Your opinion matters.  Your decision matters.  Who you love matters.  What you believe in matters.  Even if your idea or suggestion isn't used your input was considered.  I would have given anything to have known that in school even if it was from one person.  You see I was the kid that thought no one liked him.  That thought everyone thought he was weird.  That thought no one cares what I say so I won't say anything.  I tried to fit in but I couldn't be homophobic or racist so I never made fun of anyone.  I played football but still wasn't popular.  So I was the kid that was always alone no real friends to rely on.  Honestly the only thing that didn't happen to me was getting beaten up.  So I know what its like.  So im telling you that you do matter you're important and you are loved.  This dad has your back even if your family doesn't. My DM'S are open if anyone needs to chat.

Words a powerful weapon,bi_dad48,ainbow,"I really hated phrases like sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never harm me when I was a kid.  My dad loved to say words can't hurt you.  Bullshit anyone who thinks words don't hurt have never been called any kind of slurs.  A black eye will heal but the cut from the right word hurts forever.  If you think words don't hurt ask an African American about the n word, Latinos especially Mexican about the w slur or gays about f or q  slurs for example(yes I know there's others just trying to keep it short).  Words cut deep and last. Slurs like these and others come from lifetime's of hate and bitterness designed to insult and belittle a race or group.  Now people want to try and take these words back and make them positive I say there's so much negativity around them we need to get rid of them all together.  We don't need reminders of hate still being used. Instead of using words to hurt we should use them to heal and uplift. Instead of seeing a poc and referring to them by any ethnic slur see past color and realize we're all human beings.   Instead of seeing someone with blue hair and telling your buddy look at that weirdo you could say hey look at them im glad they have the courage to be themselves.  Instead of seeing someone who might be LGBTQ and saying look at that f***** its  disgusting how about saying wow I wish I had the guts to stand up and love who I want to without fear.  You see words can be a powerful weapon used to destroy or a powerful tool used to repair the damage of decades and centuries of hate.  I know we will never totally eliminate hate but it would be nice to outnumber the haters for once."

Supporting My Newly-Out Son Telling His Father,throw_aw817,ainbow, 
Awakening,bi_dad48,ainbow,We all have that moment when we realize your gender and sexuality.  Some never question their gender others remember never feeling like the sex they were born.  Some like me realize their sexuality at a young age though they never fully understand until later what it is.  I was 14 when it clicked I was bisexual others may take longer.  Its amazing watching my kids realize and understand things.  Especially about themselves like their gender and sexuality.  Like realizing you can be bi and not be 50/50 or that you can wear what you want that kind of thing and yes everything in between.  I have raised my kids and now my niece and nephew on the fact they can talk to men about anything and believe me they do.  My niece and nephew are slowly beginning to realize who they are.  My nephew loves his feminine side but prefers to remain male he feels comfortable as a femboy I hope that's proper term.  My niece is 100% lesbian at least that's what she believes for now they haven't yet realized how fluid gender and sexuality are so its possible there could be changes who knows.  For now they're the happiest I remember them in a long time.

Something I thought would be good for helping to be more satisfied in my identity would be to adopt a new name, essentially as an alias. I have a short list of names rn and pretty much I was wondering if you had any ideas?

I have some names so far and I kinda want to go for a boyish girl name that fits my personality. Something that has a masc and fem version but thats not a need. Right now I like Kassandra (shortened to a more masculine Kass) and Samantha(shortened to a more masculine Sammy or Sam). I also quite like Lily.

How do you deal with pronouns and the past?,meoka2368,ainbow,"A friend's kid has just (finally) asked to go by a male name and pronouns.  
My wife and I knew the kid was a boy well before the mother did. Her opinion on it was ""just a tomboy"" and things like that.  
BUT! since her kid has asked to use a different name and pronouns, she's been totally supportive. It all happened yesterday, with the brothers getting haircuts and a request for a ""boy haircut"" as well.  
Then the friend took a picture and posted it on Facebook with a ""everyone meet my son, Jack"" kind of caption.

So everything is fine on that end. Mucho support and acceptance.

My problem is what do you do with past tense pronouns and names?  
""She brought her son, Jack, to a mother daughter event."" doesn't seem right, but neither does dead naming or misgendering.  
I've known a number of adults who are trans, and it's ready just to ask them individually their preference, but I don't think a shy 8 year old is going to be able to answer something that nuanced.

So is there, like, a standard protocol for that kind of thing? Something generally expected within the trans community?"

When will it end,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hate such an ugly word.  Its been around since life appeared on earth.  Its like a cancer consuming a person until any decency and compassion is gone.  They hate you because of the color of your skin. They hate you because of religious beliefs ( don't believe it ask the jews and Muslims).  They hate you because your short or tall, skinny or fat, rich or poor and yes LGBTQ or straight.  One thing about hate it doesn't discriminate it hits us all.  Right now its focused on poc and LGBTQ community.  POC especially black people have faced hatred longer than anyone in the world today and why simply the color of their skin.  I can't imagine anything do ridiculous as hate for someone because their black or Asian or Latino or native American. You cannot help them color you care born and yet people hate you for.  Same for sexual orientation.  You can't help who you love or that you were born the wrong gender yet people hate us for it.  I keep hoping it ends with each new generation.  Its getting better but its still not gone.  When will we realize hating someone for things they can't control is ridiculous.  I know i need to lose weight and im bisexual your hatred of me doesn't change that.  Please lets all rise above the hate and love each other instead."

Since then, I'm educating myself and learning to be a better person.",Vegetable-Yak41,ainbow,"I looked it up, and it turns out, kindergender is a nonbinary xenogender identity where you identify as a different age demographic compared to your chronological age. He had informed me that his gender is associated with being 7 years old, and that he wants everyone else to refer to him as a 7 year old. I incorrectly and abrasively made the presumption that he was a pedophile and I said some really nasty things to him in the past which I now recognize as being bigoted, but now I realise I was indeed being bigoted, and it turns out he is actually a 7 year old, so in return for how I acted, I will be allowing him to be around my two children from now on and play with them when he comes over, and I am currently explaining to my children about LGBT+ issues. I'm 'old' and not up to date with all these new 'xenogenders', but I am trying my best to get educated! 

My message to LGBTQ (especially transgender and non binary);

***In every way you decide who and what you are, no one else has the right to determine your identity, not the law, not society, not your friends and family, not even your god has that right, you are 100 percent entitled to determine who and what you are and to be treated fairly and with respect.

Lgbtqia+ youth need your help,bi_dad48,ainbow,"People have different reasons using these subs mine its to help people if possible.  One group that in my opinion could use more help us out youth.  I have a passion for lgbtqia+ youth rights.  Now don't misunderstand me I fight for rights for everyone in the community but for the most part adults have learned to take up the fight for themselves.  The youth however are hiding in the closet scared as to what's next how to come out etc.  They have very few people looking out for them.  I think the reason im so passionate is 2 fold.  First my own experience being kicked out at 14.  Now my niece and nephew going through the same thing.  Most youth in the world don't have the resources and knowledge to fight for themselves, then if they're kicked out or abused they have no where to go.  I would love to start a program for group housing or shelters where these kids with needs could get to.  As well as provide a counselor or someone they could talk to as well as resource information about their particular sexuality or gender so they can get the proper information they need not opinions or I think it's this but im not sure.  Kids are struggling in the closet daily.  Their mental health is fragile at best.  We as a community need to step up and be a lifeline for them.  Sometimes just knowing someone is in your corner ready to stand with you can keep you together a little while longer.  My DM'S are open to anyone who needs help or an understanding ear to talk to."

Show us we matter,bi_dad48,ainbow,"As part of the lgbtqia+ society we go through a lot of shit.  Fear, bullying, not being accepted etc.  One of them worst things thought I think for anyone of us to go through is coming out and getting no reaction.  We spend our time worrying and planning trying to find out where people stand on LGBTQ rights and  picking our time.  We want some kind of reaction.  We want to know you heard us.  When I came out at 14 I got a huge reaction.  It was a lot of yelling cussing ( from Christians mind you) throwing me out it was a wild night.  Now minus being kicked out me personally would rather have that reaction than a simple whatever.  With all of their anger and all it at least told me they had invested in our relationship and didn't want it to change. Some of you may disagree hence why its just my opinion.  I talked to my niece and nephew this morning before posting this and they agree that's on some level it at least makes it seem like they still loved them.   I know some people think that being so nonchalant about it makes it seem like oh it was expected.  Oh im they cool person unfazed by your news.  What it does in reality in my opinion is negate the individual that's coming out or simply questioning their sexuality or gender.  We're not asking for a parade(although I love a parade)  and to be on the news.  We just want to know you really care one way or the other.  If you're supportive you could be excited hug them tell them how PROUD you are they told you.  If you're on the non accepting side be angry and questioning not abusive.  That lets them know you have strong feelings about them.  Talk to them about why you don't agree with it.  Maybe together you can come to an understanding. We just want to know you care about us not that what we say has no value.  Don't be dismissive especially if its a child to a parent that child needs to know you care even if you don't agree."

A great freaking day,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Today was a  great day.  The kids and i went to the mall today.  We actually had to go to a different one because the one we usually go to doesn't have some of the stores we wanted to go to.   We actually prefer this mall but its a longer drive and not always practical to go.  This mall's in a larger more lgbtqia+ friendly area.  Its always amazing every time we go because we always meet some great people.  People here aren't afraid to show their pride and be affectionate in public.   Today we met a group of trans kids who were part of a support group who were hanging out together.  They were on a field trip kind of.  They were out first time dressed as their appropriate gender for them.  We met a couple of great lesbian couples.  One of which insisted we join them for lunch and shocked us by paying.  Met A few enby people and lots of other's.  One of the best for me though I saw this boy maybe 13 or 14 with this dad.  Dad looked like a typical biker dude.  Bald head, tattoos, goatee, cutoff sleeves on this jacket and shirt all that was missing was the bike.  The kid looked completely opposite.  Very slim almost feminine features smooth skin well dressed.  I figured it was a case of daddy trying to show him how to be manly.  I learned quickly I was wrong.  Dad was totally supportive.  He had a bi flag tattoo on the side I couldn't see. Turns out son is trying out his feminine side dad was taking him shopping for outfits.  Its always great meeting new people in the community and making connections.  I love going to this mall to show my kids it is possible to be accepted and treated normally.  We always leave feeling so uplifted and happy.  We always talk about who we enjoyed meeting the most and laughing and having fun all the way home.  No brainer for me it was biker dad and son.

We're not the same,bi_dad48,ainbow,"My own kids have asked me and I have seen posts about people wondering things like; if I'm trans do I have to fully transition, if I'm bi does it have to be 50/50, etc.  Lgbtqia+ is not a cookie cutter life and I know i may catch flack from some but its what I've noticed and experienced. Trans community seems to face dilemma more than others but all face it to some degree.  No I'm not trans but I've had family and friends that are and transition was different for each of them.  Some fully transitioned some did only top surgery some did only hrt etc.  They each had to figure out what was right for them.  You see transition is different for everyone.  Im bisexual and cis male with no doubt im male but I like certain traditionally feminine things like painting my nails. Im not 50/50 either in who I like it varies from time to time.   I know some enby friends who were amab or afab who prefer or lean to one gender more same for my genderfluid friends and the list goes on.  When it comes to gender and sexuality its about what's right for you.  There is no set way on how its supposed to be.  Just because it was this way for someone else doesn't mean it has to be for you.  We need to realize we can't tell others what they need to do in terms of gender and sexuality they have to find what's right for them.  We need simply to encourage and support them."

Homophobia rears its ugly head again,bi_dad48,ainbow,"I have learned over the years you have to expect the good and the bad.  You can't have one and not the other. Call it karma or yin and yang whatever works.  Case in point I was in a great mood today.  One of my daughters my youngest(17 if it matters) to be exact made me a bi colored bracelet for pride.  Its got such positive support from you guys she's making the whole house one.  She's even considering because of interest to start selling them.  To celebrate we went to dinner at a local restaurant.  I should have known better.  Before dinner was over a local redneck came over and said you know we don't need your kind here its the queers messing with our kids heads.  I didn't we came with super powers I need to figure out what mine its lol anyway back to the story.  Now normally I would let that roll off my back but I said ""what do you mean my kind are you saying im queer"".  He said ""looking at that bracelet your bisexual"".  Really are you sure.  He said ""hell yeah I'm sure"".  I retorted with ""oh now I recognize you we chatted on grindr the other day that's how you know the bi flag colors"".  Needless to say that pissed him off and he started to punch me luckily a local police officer saw the whole thing stopped him and arrested him.  Shame really though I wanted to kick his ass just so I could say how's it feel knowing a queer beat you up lol.  For the record I wouldn't have gotten in a fight in front of the kids unless he had actually hit me.  We are home now ill a little tired but otherwise fine."
Ok so earlier I posted this pic of a bracelet my daughter made for me for pride. I have had a few of you ask if she's selling them. She would actually love to but didn't know if there'd be enough interest in them. So what do you think should she sell them. Also if not allowed in will remove,bi_dad48,ainbow,

But I am well over that phase of my life, and it really hurt to be met with those accusations.

Most of my friends don't even believe Non-binary people exist, and some of them don't even believe that transgender people exist, so I definitely can't come out to them. So how's your pride month going?"

Parents just don't get it,bi_dad48,ainbow,I may have posted on this before but can't recall.  Even if I did it needs repeating.  I can't imagine what it's like living in fear.  I grew up in the 70's and 80's right as the LGBTQ movement was coming about.  I hadn't heard enough about it to know so many parents were reacting badly to their kids coming out.  I like most kids then and now thought my parents will love me regardless.  Boy did I learn the hard way I was kicked out at 14.  So many lgbtqia+ youth today still live in fear or are scared on a daily basis.  They're afraid to come out because they're unsure how their parents will react. They've heard stories like mine and don't know if their parents will be accepting or not.  They're  Scared to tell their friends for fear of being made fun of or that their parents might find out.  Afraid of how they act and talk for fear that might slip up and do or say something that outs them.  Even ones who have come out and were not accepted are scared to ask their parents for things to represent their pride because they will just start another argument.    Parents today need to stop assuming their kids are not LGBTQ and talk to them let them know you're accepting so they don't have to be afraid.  My mission is to be the parent if your parents won't that  you can talk to you can come out to without fear you can ask questions to.  I may not can adopt all of you but I can be your queer online parent.  Sometimes we just  need to tell someone our news or it keeps building up inside until we can't hold it anymore. By telling it we can keep ourselves grounded until we know we are safe.  I want to be their if you need to cry or scream or just let it out however you need to.  I know its your parents job but my niece and nephew found out they don't always do their job.  Now they live with me.  My DM'S are always open so as soon as I get the message I will respond i promise.  With time difference though it may take a minute but I will respond.

Parenthood,bi_dad48,ainbow,I got so frustrated this morning. At breakfast this morning on my way to work I overheard two guys talking.  They were having a discussion on why gays lesbians or any other member of the lgbtq community should not have children. Their belief was a child can only be raised by a heterosexual family. I was running late for work and could not take the time to give them my opinion although I would have really liked to. There has been this underlying fear that a child being raised by lgbtq parents will automatically turn out to be in the community. People have got to get out of their heads that being lgbtq is a choice. We are born that way! That being said a child being raised by Two Loving parents regardless if they are heterosexual or not is far better off then being raised by a heterosexual couple who is abusive verbally and physically. There are so many children needing to be adopted and yet lgbtq parents are often overlooked because Society can't wrap their heads around the fact that a gay couple or a lesbian couple or a non-binary couple etc. can raise a child.  I have seen children raised by what Society calls non-traditional families and they are just as happy and healthy as children raised by heterosexual families. Are there cases where the child does turn out to be lgbtq of course. That has nothing to do with who the parents are and all to do with how the child is. Even if that child had been raised by heterosexual family they would have still turned out lgbtq.  So let's stop assuming that lgbtq couples can't be good families for children because a lot of times they may be the best option for that child.

I'm not even sure whether they would be valid accusations or not. Either way, I don't want my dads to be upset or blame themselves or have to explain themselves to people. But at the same time I don't want to hide my sexuality any longer, especially that there's a girl I really like and I'd love to start dating her openly and freely."

Question: how to help a 16-year old girl that's been kicked out by her parents,TheSixthMambo,ainbow,"Hi all

A couple of years ago my sister (15) outed herself as a lesbian. Since we're incredibly close, I (26M) was actually the first who knew. Because I'm adopted, there is an 12 year age difference between us, with me closing in on 27 this year. I live together with my wife (25) in a nice apartment close to my sister's school and our parents.


We live in a pretty LGBTQ+-friendly country, but unfortunately, there's always a few people who are still not accepting LGBTQ+-people. Two of these people are the parents of one of my sister's close friends (16F).


From what I understand, she has outed herself about a week ago, but her parents are insanely angry. They're the prototype 'conservative' people, who look at being gay as a ""choice"" and angry their (only) daughter has 'chosen' a path they do not support. My sister told me her parents are livid and have also threatened her. It's not really a religious thing, they're appear to be just very close minded and unaccepting of anything ""out of the norm"". Long story short: her parents have basically kicked her out.


My sister has now asked me and my wife if we could (temporarily) take care of her friend and if she'd be welcome to stay with us for a while. Our parents don't have the room to comfortably accommodate a teenage girl and have quite demanding jobs, so they wouldn't be there for her if she needed 'm. Meanwhile, I work from home and so does my wife a couple of times a week. Since we have a spare bedroom, it wouldn't be a problem at all to have her stay with us and I have talked about it with my wife and we're more then willing to give her a place to stay for a while. 


The problem is that neither of us really knows this girl. I mean, she's been friend with my sister for a couple of years and she's come over a couple of times after school so we know who she is and all. But, neither my wife or I have a clue how to support this girl if she were to stay with us. She's going through a lot right now and we would very much want her to be in a safe and supporting environment and giving her space at the same time.


So, questions, I have a them:

First, would it be wise to have my sister's friend stay with us? None of us wants to see her in an unsafe, unloving environment, but we don't want to leave to her own devices either.

Two, if we were to let her stay with us for a while, how can we be there for her, without smothering her but at the same time let her know that we're there for her if she needs us?


I'd really like to know your thoughts on this. If there's anything at all that we should know, please tell us. 
Many thanks in advance!


Love,

N."

I don't want to be gay.,Nearby_Highlight_195,ainbow,"This is my first reddit post so thanks for reading. I'm a 40 year old man. I've never been sexually attracted to women but am attracted to very few men. I've had a few sexual relationships but nothing meaningful...just sex. My friends are supportive....most know I'm gay, some don't. Both my parents are dead but they were from the 60's and  uber-supportive, and all my siblings know and are 100% supportive. I've personally experienced very little social stigma but I'm not blind to it's existence. I say all this because I don't want to be gay! It's not because I'm trying to hide or fit in. I want to be straight because most men are morons and I can not envision spending my life w/ another man...I'd be miserable! I get along with women much better, I appreciate feminie beauty, and choosing to spend my life with a female is what I'd prefer. It would be great if the attraction were there too....possibly biological kids, nothing against adoption but I would perfer to have kids who share my blood and I'm against using a woman merely as a breeding vessel. I want my own life, my own kids, my own comfort.

I'm looking for advice. I'm not considering bogus conversion therapy and I'm not some self-loathing Christian looking to conform. What should I do, if anything? As I pass 40 I'm growing fearful of a life spent alone. Thx again for reading."

Mentally well,bi_dad48,ainbow,My nephew was telling me today how much better his mental health has been since coming out.  NOW THIS DOESN'T MEAN IM PROMOTING COMING OUT IF ITS NOT SAFE.  He's telling me that the stress of hiding his sexuality and remembering not to slip up had him depressed and angry all the time.  He would sit in his room and sulk and mope and then for seemingly no reason at all he got angry and throw things and literally just explode.  Which truth is he got fired from a couple of jobs for angry outbursts.  I have noticed his mood is much better and there's been no anger issues. He says its like the door that had his joy was locked and coming out unlocked it.  He said he doesn't remember ever being this happy probably because he was made to dress and act different than he was.  His sister wasn't quite to that point yet cause she'd only been hiding a couple years.  It never occurred to me how badly being in the closet can effect mental health. I came out as soon as I realized who I was but for others living in the closet is hell.  Friends again your safety comes first but if you absolutely for the sake of your mental health need to come out then weigh the pros and cons and do what's best for you. Don't suffer with this alone  If you need to talk it out my DM'S are open hmu.

Whatever that looks like to you do it if you can ( I know sometimes your home life doesn't allow it right now but when you can do it). Whether that's dressing how you want, wearing makeup or nail polish whether your male or female or non binary etc., wearing your hair a certain way, getting tattoo or piercings whatever it is that makes you feel unique do it.  Now society or even friends may make fun of you or bully you. I don't tell you that to scare you out of doing it but rather to prepare you to face it head on.   It does not make it right but its life right now so you have to own that look. Decide that I love how I look despite what others say.  If you're confident in your look eventually they will give up.  Don't let anyone tell you that you cant wear that your a boy or your a girl, or only girls can wear makeup and nail polish.  Lets shake this world up by proving clothes and makeup etc. have no gender and we can express ourselves how we want.

HAPPY PRIDE MONTH FROM A BANGLADESHI BISEXUAL BOY.,LilliputianMouse,ainbow, 
Insecurities about pride: why it will always matter,headreplacement,ainbow,"  

CW: Internalised homophobia, discussions of bigotry 

The Australian experience of pride month usually begins on the 2nd, as we wake up to discover that most of the world has finally caught up to the same month as us. Thats when you start to notice all the corporations giving their lip service, and the equally abundant criticism of the corporatisation of the month. Also right on cue are all the people objecting to the necessity of pride, or at least the need of it to occupy a whole month, as well as everyone else arguing with those people.  Largely thats what pride month is in the circles I have a tendency to inhabit. 

I think in this environment I am struck by a kind of impulse to justify pride to myself. The narrative that its irrelevant, that its a performance of victimhood for those who are no longer victims, is present enough that it burrows into my subconscious mind, despite its obvious implausibility. It goes without saying that pride is relevant, that its far from a performance of anything but strength in the face of a shame that is far from eradication.  

Unfortunately, I find myself particularly susceptible to this insecurity because of the fortunate circumstance I live with. Im able to live my life as an openly gay man for my entire adult life, as well as most of my adolescence. I have supportive parents, friends, family. I live in a country where my government affords me rights and protections most do not. When I have faced challenges, there has invariably been support available. Growing up for me, like most people, was rife with challenges. But they were for the most part the same challenges and any anxious kid with ADHD and not enough friends faces. When I did feel different because of my identity, I had a wealth of literary figures who were in their own ways outsiders, and sometimes I would mentally accuse myself of making the whole thing up for the sake of having an excuse to relate to my fictional heroes. 

Looking back, its hard to imagine how I could possibly have thought that, but in the throes of my most heightened moments of teenage self-doubt, I was able to explain away my sundry crushes and fantasies. So, its safe to say that this insecurity has been with me for a long time. Invalidating my identity and my own experience of pride is a well-worn path in my brain. 

There is a lot of ways to respond to the hypothetical doubter of pride. You could point to the countless ways that queerphobia and heterosexism are experienced in Australia. You could point to the experience of trans people, who more than ever are the targets of politicians and society in equal measure. You could point to the importance of the signal it sends to countries, communities and families which are less accepting than the general Australian population. All these and more are good arguments, but they speak to experiences that are largely apart from my own. 

What I fail to see in my moments of doubt are all the little times when pride has helped me. All the time when its been the little voice in my ear telling me that Im not alone, that I matter, that Im worthy of love.  That despite not seeing myself in any of the movies, tv shows or books that I grew up with, despite never personally knowing or seeing another openly queer person for so long, there were legions of others just like me. For me, pride is about giving back to a community that was there for me, even when I didnt always see it. Pride is and has always been a protest, but for me, it's not just a protest against systemic legal and social oppression, but also against the loneliness and alienation of the modern world. Even when every legal battle is won and each social stigma deeply diminished, we will remain a community that stands together. After all, it's no more arbitrary of reason to form a community than sports teams and religion.  Thats what I believe in anyway."

Normally I'm attracted to cis men and trans women.

Personally I'm attracted to androgonous and feminine looks but I'm almost never attracted to cis woman.

But for the first time in a long time (maybe 7 or 8 years) I felt attracted to a cis female.

I'm usually not attracted to cis females but for some reason in very rare cases I find myself attracted to a cis woman usually for a combination of looks and persnality. 

Maybe I'm only attracted to cis woman if they hit that right balance of looks and personality and that i'm just generally disproportionatley attracted to cis men and trans women .

IDK. What do you think? Please be kind, i'm still trying to figure things out.

Let the pride flow,bi_dad48,ainbow,Hey y'all It's the start of pride month.  A lot of people decide to use this month to start showing a little bit to a lot of who they are.  I was at the mall today and saw everything from a simple button on a jacket to a full rainbow suit complete with rainbow hair it was awesome.  Even while my kids and I were eating our server told us he was pan of course we were all sporting something rainbow or bi colored so he knew he could tell us.  Of course as we walked around there were  those who were adamantly against pride and they didn't hesitate to voice their opinion.  The good thing was at didn't spoil anyone's mood.  Now this is also the time a lot of people decide to come out.  Some decided to do it at the mall today in hopes of avoiding a scene.  For the most part it worked I saw a few that didn't go so well even though I couldn't hear what was said the facial expressions and hand gestures and the pointing at other LGBTQ people was enough to figure out what was going on. The reaction would have probably been worse at home.   I'm sure there were others who went good they just weren't as easy to spot.  Friends if you do decide you want to come out I urge you make sure you can safely do so and have a plan if you can't safely do so.  Yes I know being in the closet weighs heavily on you and your feel you just need to do it.   It's better however to stay in the closet than be on the streets trust me I know first hand.  Enjoy pride month I know I will.  My DM'S are open permission granted to message me any fun cool or exciting stories about pride or if you're struggling hmu maybe I can help.

Seeking advice and don't know what subreddit to post this to. Pls help!!,at-rainbows-end,ainbow,"Burner account bc duh. Before I start, I want to say that I fully realize I sound like a homophobic POS, and if it makes yall feel better, I feel awful about it.

I dont know what to do.

I guess Ill start off by saying that I identify as queer- I am bi but have a preference for girls. I came out when I was 13 and it took a whillle for my parents to finally support me (but my mom is specifically really cool about it now!). Since then, Ive dealt with a lot of internalized homophobia and self-hatred for who I am- and this is coming from someone who leads the queer history club at my high school lol. I was sexually taken advantage of by my best friend who is a girl last year, and have an inkling that this has to do with my internalized homophobia. I was also partially outed to some of my Iranian family when I was 14- and I think this has caused some trauma.

Enter my sister. My sister is 14 (I am almost 18) and is incredibly impressionable. She rotates her **entire** life over what she sees on tiktok, and genuinely has zero interests or ideas that dont come from the app. She has copied me for most of my life, and now seems to copy even more of what she sees on the app.

It has always been my biggest fear that she decides she is lgbt, and Im worried this has happened. Earlier the summer she came out to me, and Im worried its because of the way queer identity is seen as almost a trend on tiktok. She literally only jokes about being queer, and doesnt understand the actual reality behind being so. Again, she is incredibly impressionable, and has admitted to both my identity and her social media presence playing a role in her coming out.

If she comes out to me, my entire family will no longer believe my own identity, and will think that we are both acting on a trend. My parents are both immigrants, and have sacrificed so much to live a prosperous, successful life. I feel like I am robbing them of seeing us grow up and have husbands, and I feel like they've worked so hard to make sure we live the best life possible.

I just want them to be happy. I feel like I am forever in their debt for the sacrifices they've made to ensure we live a good life in this country, and this will cause them to not trust either of us.

I feel like they also see me as some sort of example for the rest of the family, and that both of us coming out will tarnish their reputation, much less my own coming out. My mom didnt even know gay people existed until she was an adult, so I dont expect her to believe that both of her daughters are leaning toward women.

Either way, I just dont know what to do. I told my sister to hold off on coming out until I leave for college, and I know this is unethical. She decided she is a lesbian over quarantine, and I feel like te fact thats she hangs out on a lot of anti-men sites on the internet is aggregativig this.

I SOUND LIKE A HOMOPHOBE. I PROBABLY AM. This is awful, I know.

I sound like every unsupportive parent out there, but I dont know what to do.

Now my sister dmed me last night, telling *me* not to come out as a lesbian before she does (I guess she thinks if I come out from bi to a lesbian, my parents will think she is copying me). I just dont know what to do. None of this feels right. I dont want to let my parents down.

The current plan is just to move far, far, away for college and let all of the chaos unfold on it's own. fuck.

False Definitions of Bisexuality (and why they are wrong),violetdragons,ainbow, 
Realizing,bi_dad48,ainbow,I've seen on my social media apps and have talked to people IRL that have wondered if its to late to come out because they've seen and heard some say they community treated them badly.  The answer is no its never to late.  People realize their sexuality at different ages and for different reasons and they come out at different ages for different reasons.   A lot of people like me figure it out at a young age others much later in life and others somewhere in between.  It doesn't matter when you realize it its always ok to come out if you're ready.  Now I always add for young people if its safe to do so.  I won't go into my whole coming out story again( DM me if you want whole story I'll share it there) but I was kicked out but back then it never crossed my mind that could happen.  We should never judge someone for when they come out.  We don't know their situation.  It could be as a young person their family was so homophobic they just suppressed those feelings and now they've resurfaced.  It maybe they live in a country where they're punished by jail or death and had to get to a country that's safe.  And it could be they just never realized their feelings until now.  Whatever the reason coming out is a personal journey for everyone to take when they're ready.  Rushing it can lead to consequences your not ready for so please don't shame people for coming out late instead embrace the fact that they finally were ready to do so.  We should be a community of love and acceptance not bullying.  God knows we've all had enough of that not too do it to anyone else.

Fun day,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Had the day off today for memorial day and my partner and I took the kids to local lake to swim at the beach area.  We had a blast.  FYI for those who don't know 3 if my 4 kids are LGBTQIA and the 4th is an ally of course.   As expected we had a few heteros who had a problem with the kids rainbow colors and mine and my nephews painted nails and me and my partner being affectionate  but we ignored them and let the park rangers handle it.  We did meet several LGBTQIA people and allies as a result and made some new friends, kids even met some their ages and got contact info for later.  Its funny I didn't realize there were this many in the community so close to me.  There's not much of a social scene here so i never ventured to the lake or anything until the kids moved in.  Its amazing how we can make friends so easy if we just put ourselves out there sometimes.  Turns out i should have been going out all along lol."

I recently found out that Im not straight! Im more so just using this to get my thoughts out. :),sunnydaisy88,ainbow,"Hey everyone!!! So for most of my life I thought I was 100% straight (female) and didnt think much of it. Id always been an active ally but was never a part of the lgbt+ community past that. I did call myself demisexual although I feel that doesnt make me any more part of the lgbt+ community more than being an ally does as I still considered myself hetero. 

Fast forward to a year ago when I met the friends I have now and they helped me see that men arent all Im interested in. I started to think that maybe I was pansexual (which from reading others experiences seems to be fairly common with getting confused with demisexual). But that didnt feel right with me either as I have a definite preference for men/masculinity. 

Right now, Im thinking Im bisexual but still demi? I definitely am attracted to men, both femme and masc enbys, androgyny, and have lately been attracted to a few women. I hope this doesnt sound confusing. Regardless, I dont care too much about labels personally. Im a believer in youre attracted to who youre attracted to and thats all that matters. :) 

I havent told anyone except one person and I dont really think I will. I think Ill worry about that if the day comes where I am with someone who is not a man. But I dont feel that I really *need* to right now. 

Anyways thanks for reading sorry if this came out to be a mess!! This is all so new to me but exciting to be learning more about myself. :)"

Update,bi_dad48,ainbow,Quite a few people have messaged and asked for an update on the situation between my oldest daughter and her boyfriend.  If you don't remember she asked me not too mention my sexuality to him he's homophobic.  I was not sure what to think why she would ask me that. I say down with her after I cooled off and had a talk with her. She told me she was trying to work on him to get him to change his views and couldn't think of anything else to do to get more time.  I said really you could have told me this in the beginning im understanding plus I've dealt with homophobes I could have helped you. Turns out he figured out what she was doing anyway and left her.  Shes fine not too upset but shes going to find out next time where a guy stands before dating him.  She and I had a long discussion about the people in this house not hiding who we are and it not being fair to ask us to.  From now on shes not going to ask us to do that.  Lesson learned lol.
You are loved,bi_dad48,ainbow,LGBTQIA+ community is unique when you look at it from the outside.  Most communities are made up of the same people like an asian community or an irish community etc.  The LGBTQIA community though like a small handful of other's all come from different backgrounds.  Some may be rich some maybe poor others in between.  Some are from countries different than your own.  Our skin colors are different our education levels are different our shapes and sizes are different you get the picture. In all of that though there are things that unite us.  We are all LGBTQIA+ we are all persecuted for who we love some much worse than others.  We all fight for our rights to love who we want and to be treated equally.  We fight to express ourselves in many different ways.  Yes we're visibly different but we are the same.  Now I may not know you personally but know this I LOVE YOU.  I do because we need to love each other to win this fight.  If they get us divided over things like bisexuals don't exist or this group really doesn't belong etc. then we can never be united enough to win.  I love you Im proud of you and I support you 100%.  You have permission to message me my DM'S are open.

Be free be you,bi_dad48,ainbow,I saw the most amazing YouTube documentary type thing awhile back.  It was about a boy in Europe in believe that's into drag at age 12 I think now but was 9 or 10 when he started.  He has learned to do his own makeup and wig's and everything.  He's got his own routine for shows where he sings and performs.  What made this truly amazing though was the support from his parents.  They never tried to discourage him. They got him someone to teach him makeup and how to perform the whole thing.  His parents never let him get into the adult side of it.  They keep his show pg.   Now of course the cishet's had a fit because they see it as sexualizing the child. Now I see no difference in that than these parents who's kids do beauty pageants. Let the kids express themselves yes make sure they're safe of course but don't stifle them.  They need to test the waters within reason but let them try.  This kid doing drag is happy and good lol.  Fierce as any adult drag queen I've seen.  I don't know if anyone here does drag or has kids who do but if you do know I love and support you.  You are truly unique and marvelous.

A months not enough,bi_dad48,ainbow,Ok i have a bit of a rant and its simply because of something I saw in a chain store.  Am I the only one upset that 1. pride only has a month celebration dedicated to it.  2.  The corporation profit like hell off it and I wonder if any of goes for the fight of LGBTQIA rights.  See we aren't LGBTQIA+ just during that time.  Oh no its all day everyday.  Pride is not something that should just be celebrated one time a year for a month.  I don't know about y'all  but im a proud bisexual everyday not just during pride.  Too many people have fought and struggled for us just to celebrate it for a month(Now I know others have as well such as African Americans who definitely have it worse than us and have fought longer and harder for rights). This rant is just focused on pride.   Pride has become an opportunity for commercial businesses to profit off our fight.  Once a month they roll out the rainbow flags and pride merchandise and expect us to believe they're allies.  I say enough we need to hold them accountable all year if they've claimed to be allies then show it all year long.  Instead we should be supporting Anyone in the community who makes jewelry or clothing or anything else.  They ought to be the ones we're buying from and if you're not selling your stuff you should.  We need to be proud and celebrate our pride absolutely but we don't need to be silent after the celebration is over. Be proud everyday you've earned it.

A man I've been crushing on for months rejected me yesterday after I told him that I'm asexual,Feeling-Giraffe6336,ainbow,"I'm 27 (F), he is 47.

Not sure what to do next. There were other people (who didn't look familiar) just chatting with him. He had some kind of paper and a pen where he was taking notes.

Anyway, I noticed that he kept talking to everyone else, but not to me. Some discussion about sexualities came up, and when I said that I'm aromantic asexual, he looked at me really weird, frowning, squinting his eyes, and kind of pouting his lips, before turning away, and then started talking to everyone else and kind of blanked me. Then when he started leaving I tried to follow him but he kind of started to run anyway and seemed to be in a grumpy mood.

When he was walking away I tried asking him if I upset him and he didn't look at me and said ''yeah I gotta go home now'' and he just left.

Did I offend him? If so, why? What should I do now?

Thing is I'm not sure if I really am aromantic, I just haven't felt romantic feelings towards someone in over 12 years, but maybe this feeling for a close friendship with him is romance and I just can't recognize it because it's been so long and don't want to admit to myself I need a partner?

I feel so upset and lost with myself."

Needing advice,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Guys I don't know how to handle a situation at home.  Its odd for me im used to giving advice not needing it lol.  I think I know how to handle it I just wanted some other input.  Ok so here it is.  My oldest daughter is straight and has a new boyfriend.  She seems to really like him and I as dad I want to meet him.  My daughter told me last night I could meet him this weekend only if I don't mention im bisexual and currently dating a guy.  Turns out her boyfriend is homophobic and really uncomfortable with people in the community.  I told her I worked to hard to be proud of who I am to hide it now and she needs to really think if a guy who is opposed to 3/4 of her family is worth it.  I told her I wouldn't just make a point to tell him outright, but if the conversation went that direction or he made homophobic remarks I would speak up.  Guys im heartbroken I feel like shes putting her feelings for him above everyone else in this house because 4 out of 5 living here are LGBTQIA+.  Im not asking them to hide either with what they've been through they don't need to.   My question is 2 part.  

1. Should I talk to her about why she hasn't spoken up when he showed his homophobic side and already told him about us.  ( my thought is yes I should because something is going on I wonder if she feels like an outsider because she's not LGBTQ or something idk).

2. Should I find away to bring it up myself when I meet him or just sit on it for now?  (Part of me wants to show up wearing pride stuff and bring my boyfriend and kiss him all during lunch)

Let them go,bi_dad48,ainbow,I've been out for 34 years and in that time I've had people ask me IRL and online how to keep from losing friends when I come out.  Im going to be honest with you most of the time you cant. I know that's going to hurt but hear me out.  When I came out I lost family and friends and it hurt like hell.  I couldn't understand it nothing had changed other than my sexuality.  What I didn't understand at the time was people want you too stay just like you were.  They don't want you too change and grow.  Some people can't stand it when you're finally happy.  Yeah being homeless for me was tough but finally being happy with who I was for me made it worth it.  The other thing is some of your friends were raised with different or taught different beliefs and sometimes they won't change them.  No matter how badly you want to remain friends LGBTQIA+ goes against most major religions and that's not an easy gap to close.  What I had to learn and what you have to learn is let them go. No matter how badly you want to keep your friends If your spending your time worried about them and not your own happiness let them go.  If they add nothing to the value of your life let them go.  If all they do is hold you back and keep you down let them go.  Its like trimming dead flowers off of a plant you have to get rid of dead weight to allow new growth.  You have to get rid of people who can't or won't support you regardless of how long you have known them.  Same for family if they're toxic let them go you are your own person.  When I finally realized how much time and tears I wasted trying to fix irreparable relationship's instead of fixing me it was like a huge weight was moved off me.  Im not saying all relationships like that are beyond repair but you have to learn to recognize the ones that are and end them. Its true what they no pain no gain.  My DM'S are open for anyone.

Validation,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Lets forget for the moment exactly how many genders and sexualities there are.  I don't say that as a way of saying they're not important but rather the exact number doesn't matter. Gender and sexuality are fluid and we're finding out there's more of them everyday.  Now I know there's people out there saying there's only 2 genders male and female and yes biologically speaking in terms of genitals only that's right.  They also say heterosexual is the only sexuality that's right.  Im here today to tell you there's more to gender and sexuality than that its more complex.  Your feelings about who you are and who you're attracted to are valid.  So despite the hetero narrow minded view know this (and im speaking to everyone under these broader umbrella terms)you are valid. Lesbians you are valid, gays you are valid, bisexuals you are valid, trans you are valid, queers you are valid, intersex you are valid asexuals you are valid and + you are valid.  There are numerous genders and sexualities that fall under these broader umbrella's and each and every one of them is valid its just this post would be to long to name them all.  Validation is important and our community seems to be viewed as less valid so today remember you are valid.  It is ok to DM me you don't have to ask."
Any gay guys on here do not like Anal topping or bottoming?,OutrageousAsk1284,ainbow,"Not sure I will make much sense as I am bad at explaining but I'll try as it's been bugging me for ages now....years Infact.


So when I came out as gay when I was 22 ISH (39 now) I was bottom...total bottom and loved it where it was the best feeling ever. I am not someone who has had many sexual partners, I have only had 3 relationships since coming out not lasting long...first was 3 years, 2nd was a year and the other just less than a year all of those I was a bottom...been single 9 years though now as I get zero interest from guys plus not many gay people around me and for me travelling more than 50 miles will not make for a relationship for me.

During these relationships I tried topping and back then was not for me at all.

But maybe 6 years ago I went totally off being bottom...fully hate it and no interest at all.

So the sexual encounters I have had have either been oral only or I have topped as I did get more into it than I was years before in my relationships BUT I can not say it does anything for me. I think I turned to doing it because I was not bottom anymore.

There were times when me trying to top did not work as it did not excite me or I was....excited for it but because it was not straight....in and down to it and was more fussy it turned me off right away.

Even when I have topped successfully it does not do much for me more so compared to how I felt being a bottom.

I am coming to the conclusion that while I am no longer a bottom....I am also not a top.

I have also found guys I am attracted too still mystically end up being too only...like when I was a bottom. Now I know you get tops and bottoms that look all ways but back when I was a bottom I was always sexually attracted to guys who happened to be tops and it's nearly always been like that still.

I have not had a relationship since last ex which ended in 2012...been on 3 days a few times each person but it never went further and that's my love life so I've not had a relationship where I am the TOP.

I am getting on at 39...gay years this is nearly dead haha.

I have no idea what to do about any of it. Dating wise nothing happens as mostly it's apps and dating sites, it's rare to meet other gay guys out and about....some people make out it's easy when it is now.....there are only so many gay guys in 1 area less so that are single and less so where you both like each other so chances of meeting any is slim...plus I do not drink so do not go to bars etc as I feel uncomfortable.

So if I met someone I am worried because I'm not bottom and do not think I am top which slims chances of me ever finding someone again :/"

"I would like to discuss the recent ""coming out"" news of Betty DeVille from Rugrats",1BoiledCabbage,ainbow,"Hi. I would like to have an open discussion on the recent ""coming out"" of the character Betty DeVille from Rugrats. Fair warning, this (from what I understand) is an unpopular opinion. 

I do have an issue with this. I understand that everyone comes out at different times in their life and some have come out many years after being in a straight relationship or marriage. I'm all for representation in the media and encourage it. However, I don't see why Betty couldn't remain presumably straight. 

I saw the DeVille's as a family that bent gender norms and expectations in a time where doing so was shamed by the majority society. Betty was a strong woman who took charge and was for women's rights. Howard was a laid back man who was comfortable allowing his wife to make important decisions and the twins were two children who loved both feminine &amp; masculine hobbies, dressed androgynous and other than the bow on lil, looked identical. 

My question is, why can't we simply have a straight woman, straight man and straight children that represent a side that no one sees? Coming back to Betty, whenever there's a strong, cis, straight woman in media, she's always slim, model-like, with long flowing hair."

What I am about to share happened to me when I was a kid I've read post that it has happened to others as kids it will go to show you just how ignorant some people are. When I was a kid after I came out and was subsequently made homeless for a little while I was eventually taken in by an uncle of mine. In the neighborhood where he was there were plenty of kids my age but as soon as they found out I was bisexual they no longer wanted to play. I found out that it was because their parents were afraid they could become gay or bisexual by hanging out with me. Just a word to everyone who thinks that FYI being gay or bisexual is not contagious or any other division of LGBTQIA+ for that matter.  You can no more become gay by hanging out with a kid that's gay then you can getting brown eyes from hanging out with a kid with brown eyes. It just doesn't work that way lgbtq kids are kids just like anybody else all they want is friends and to be loved.  You can cause those children more harm by keeping your kids away from them then you do letting your kid play with them.  It teaches your children that being LGBTQIA+ is like some sort of disease like leprosy to be feared its not.  This world needs to be educated so they no longer fear and misunderstand us.  We should all be able to coexist with each other without hatred and division.
Exploring gender and sexuality,bi_dad48,ainbow,"I have seen and heard a lot and done a lot in my years on the LGBTQIA+ community and it seems in every generation there's always 2 common confusions.  Gender and sexuality.  We're always trying to figure out what gender and what sexuality we are.  Now some older people experience this but its generally decided or experienced during puberty and teen years.  So how do you figure it out.  What I'm going to tell you is basics but these will get you started in the right direction.  

First remember gender and sexuality are fluid there is no set parameter they can change as you grow or you may figure it out early on and it stay the same throughout the rest of your life. So let's start with gender one of the easiest thing to do first try out different pronouns. If you were born female but it doesn't feel right try using he him pronouns they them pronouns and so on until you find something that feels right.  Next don't be afraid to experiment outside of normal gender roles. If you were born female and subsequently dress as female try dressing more masculine we're bow ties dress shirts jeans ball caps things like that experiment with your style in other words don't limit yourself have fun with it. Try experimenting with different hairstyles if you were born male try wearing makeup there's lots of things you can do to experiment . There is no right way or wrong way to do it find what works for you and then go forward.  

Now let's talk about sexuality that's a little tougher but again it's still fluid it changes or can change.  So just like gender when it comes to sexuality the best way to figure it out as experiment. Let's face it we were all raised to be straight and most of us who are in the community know we never really felt straight. Some of us knew right off what sexuality we were others of us had to experiment. So if you always dated male's for instance and you're a female the only way you're going to know if you like dating females or non-binary or any other gender is to try. Same goes for males who have always dated females the only way you're going to know if you're gay or interested in dating non-binary or other genders is to try. There are however some things you need to remember though when experimenting. Number one always be transparent be upfront of your intentions and expectations as you're trying out new genders. Never lead someone on letting them think you're one sexuality when in fact you're experimenting.  Number two be upfront with your expectations and it's okay not to really know what those are at the beginning. If you're experimenting and things are going the Direction you don't feel comfortable with speak up don't wait till it's too late.  Number three don't be afraid to take risks. You never know what you'll like if you don't try. There again don't be afraid to speak up if you realize hey this really isn't what I was hoping for. Also try dating somebody you wouldn't have normally considered. Number four check in on yourself. As you are experimenting always remember to ask yourself how you're doing are you comfortable is this what you were expecting and be honest with yourself when answering. Number five probably one of the most important is educate yourself. The internet is full of answers about all the different sexualities and genders. It is always good to research and find out everything you can about what you're trying. Both you and your potential partner will benefit from it greatly. Number six don't get hung up on labels. There are labels for everything within our community don't let them deter you from trying something. You may find out the label didn't mean exactly what you thought it did. Finally don't be afraid to reach out. If you know people within the community that are the sexuality you're interested in exploring talk to them find out what it's like don't be afraid to make new friends. This journey can be exciting if you allow it to be. Always remember be safe but have fun."

What if we werent born that way?,completely-ineffable,ainbow, 
Work,bi_dad48,ainbow,So after my aha moment yesterday I decided today to tell everyone at work I was bi with a preference for men.  Truth be told I think im going gay all the way but we'll see.  Anyway I realized I couldn't be myself if I was hiding part of me.  Not to mention I was getting pretty tired of gay jokes and telling them to stop.  Now I'm not suggesting everyone needs to come out and quit hiding that's a personal choice for everyone depending on how safe it is to do so.  I would never and have never told anyone to come out if it wasn't absolutely safe to do so.  So I started at the top with my boss and its went really well.  I told her the only reason I haven't come out yet is because I didn't want it to hurt her business.  She told me too let her worry about that and she supports me 100%.  I then told my Co workers individually during the day.  A few of the had that oh shit look because they remembered some of the jokes they told.  I told them I was willing to forget it if it stops now.  The only one who gave me crap or tried to was this really religious fanatic.  He started in about it being a sin and against gods will and after he finished I told him his belief and mine about god were different therefore any further talks of religion I would be walking away from.  All in all it went well and I feel so much more free now.

Come join the new r/GayTeenBros!,The_PJG,ainbow,"I noticed the old [r/GayBroTeens](https://www.reddit.com/r/GayBroTeens/) has been inactive for a long ass time now so I created a new one! Welcome to [r/GayTeenBros](https://www.reddit.com/r/GayTeenBros/)!

When I went to check out [r/GayBroTeens](https://www.reddit.com/r/GayBroTeens/) I found that the last post was 3 years ago. Apparently the mod approved each post manually, and when he left reddit like 2 years ago (judging from his profile) there was nobody to aprove posts anymore and the sub died with him. So I made a new one! [r/GayTeenBros](https://www.reddit.com/r/GayTeenBros/).

Unlike the old one, this one does NOT require posts to be approved by a mod to be posted (as it should be IMO). Also unlike the old one, in this one you are not allowed posts asking to chat or whatever. That's basically everything the other was used for and I find it kinda creepy. So no.

But aside from that come join! Fresh new sub for discussion, advice, rants, memes and much more!

Aha moment,bi_dad48,ainbow,"You ever have an aha moment.  You know one of those moments where you suddenly realized something you should have seen or known sooner.  I did the other day.  I was at a local department store and I realized how many people who were LGBTQIA+ were actually here in my little town.  I always thought it was such a rural and conservative area that there's no way there's a significant part of the population in the community.  As I looked around there were same sex couples holding hands and others you could tell by some of the things they wore and I couldn't believe I hadn't noticed before.  Now in the USA they estimated that 10% of the population is or identifies as LGBTQIA+ but I think it's higher because they're those still in the closet.  Even 10% though is a large number of people. Even in conservative areas like mine its becoming more visible how many of us there are.  It made me realize im not always as open about my sexuality as I should be.  Im sure others can say the same. In my job no one knows im bi because I convinced myself they didn't need to.  It wasn't like I was really hiding it I told myself its just none of their business, and its not but I know the only reason I didn't tell is fear of losing my job or being made fun of. Its still such a conservative area I was also afraid if they knew it would hurt business.  Now im thinking maybe its not as conservative and backwards thinking as I thought.  I know this im only hurting myself not being who I am.  Its time to come out of the last closet and be totally free.  Hell even as I write this I feel the weight being lifted and I know its what I must do."
Can someone explain the meaning behind the black and brown stripes added to pride flags and the progress flag.,Spamz_27,ainbow,"I guess im just feeling a little out of the loop as to what the black and brown stripes are trying to represent on new pride flags. I thought It was race related but that just doesn't make sence as skin colour isn't a sexual orientation or gender identity.

Can someone explain the actual meaning behind them and maybe point out the events the lead up the their Inclusion? Thanks."

Love this,bi_dad48,ainbow,Ok so in my job i meet lots of people on a daily basis.  Im a funeral director so literally in meet all types of people to.  Typically being in the south and a small country town most are simple farmers just good country conservatives but mostly homophobic.  For that reason and because I love my job I am in the closet at work while I look for a place more accepting.  Occasionally though I meet someone from the community and its really cool.  Not everyone I work with feels that way but my boss is supportive so no comments are made anymore there's still disapproving looks but its better.  Anyway today I met a boy and his family(no gender assumed he said he identifies as male uses he/him pronouns I asked).  The boy was 17 years old and bi right down to the cuffed jeans and bi colored socks.  His family was super supportive dad was wearing a bi colored bow tie which I found out he had custom made because he couldn't find one he liked.  Mom had bi flag earrings and bracelets and his little sister who was 4 had on rainbow colored sneakers.  I told her they were pretty and she said they're for the rainbow community because my brothers bi and we love him.  Now it might look cheesy and a little overboard with support but this kid knows where his family stands.  We talked awhile and he's faced bullying at church and school but with a supportive family he pushes through. They actually changed to an affirming church and he's getting support there to.  They are planning on attending pride in Atlanta this year to.  Maybe I will run into them there I wish I had gotten some contact info from them but such is life.

Encouragement,bi_dad48,ainbow,Today I just wanted to tell you you're loved.  No activist type posts this morning no trying to hype anyone up to fight the fight.  We never hear that enough and sadly some never hear it at all.  I don't know about you but when I came that's all I wanted hell needed to hear.  Just simply you're loved. Its amazing how powerful that word is when spoken or shown in truth.  It can lift you up when you're down.  It can bring you closer to people.  It can do what no other words can.  So  If no one else especially family or friends tell you today just know you have love and support with me.  We are in this together and sometimes we get down because we think no one appreciates us.  I know I feel like that sometimes.  When we feel like that its nice to know someone cares.  So if you ever need to hear you're loved or supported just ask me the answer from me its always a heartfelt yes. DM'S are allowed no need to ask permission is granted.
PLEASE HELP REDDIT,HudsonMS7326,ainbow,"So my boyfriend we will call him Tim. Tim and I have been in a relationship for almost 2 years. We are gay and had the best time. We have so much in common and became the best of friends. Recently we had been through a rough patch and he doesn't know what he wants anymore. He said he doesn't know if mahogany is what he is after anymore. We had plans to grow old together, get married, have kids and promised to never leave each other. I caught him on grindr and he said he will just keep hurting me and we have to split up. He said it's got nothing to do with me, he is confused himself, he wants me but he also doesn't know if he can settle just yet. I was working fulltime, he was part time while he studies and he doesn't know if he can give me the attention I deserve. I was always happy and supportive with his studies. He says he still loves me. But he is confused because he doesn't understand how he feels towards everything. We were so perfect and then 3 days ago, it was just like we were never together. I wanna know if anyone else has gone through this before and if there's a solution to this problem. I want to be with him and I know he wants to be with me too and I am willing to do whatever it takes to either fix this or wait a lifetime for him. He said he could take a few days, a few months or even a few years. He just doesn't know what he wants or needs. Can someone please tell me if there is any hope for me to fix this? If there is any way I can help him come to terms with his feelings and to come back to me or if I'm just wasting my time. I would try anything to get back what we had. I have been giving him space but its killing me slowly. I don't want to start moving on before I know there is absolutely nothing I can do to fix this. I am a big person for having a soul mate and he even said I'm his. I tried offering counciling but he said it's nothing that they could help with. I don't want to give up. Can someone out there please help, let me know if they have gone through the same thing or if they know anybody who has and came out the other side hand in hand again. I really need my best friend back.

Any feedback or advice is appreciated."

Now I've heard guts say it and no its not my first time hearing it.  Am I the only one though that cringes when I hear it.  Like today it was all I could do not to make a scene and gouge out her privileged eyes.  First honey you don't choose to be gay bi lesbian trans queer etc. We were born this way.  Trust me when we tell you no one chooses this life. The only thing about our lives we choose is when to come out and to who.  We battle everyday for who we are in some cases for our lives.  We have protested and fought hard for our rights.  We have been ostracized by our families and friends.  We have been shunned by our religion's.  We are bullied called names and looked at as freaks and you have the audacity to think it's a choice.  Its not more a choice than eye color or hair color or how tall you are.  You didn't choose to be hetero anymore than we chose who we are.  So don't dare trivialize what we go through by thinking we can slip in and out of it like a robe.  WE ARE LGBTQIA+ we didn't choose it we were born to it."

We're a better version of us,bi_dad48,ainbow,One of the biggest complaints or issues I here from people about there parents is that they say the ones coming out are no longer who they used to know.  That however is not entirely true. We are who you used to know just better.  We're kinda like water beatles.  As long as we're in the water crawling around we're limited to who we can be and where we can go. When we are in the closet we're limited. We can't date who we want wear what we want act how we want. We have to come out of the water dry ourselves in the sun in order to emerge as the dragonfly.  While we're in the closet we limit our true selves. Its not that we're no longer who you know its now we're completely ourselves no longer confined but free to fly and shine.  I think this is true for all LGBTQIA+ but especially for trans.  Your literally in the wrong body you must break free of that shell and be the dragonfly a new person outside but still the same person inside.  If you're not in the community you will never fully understand the pressure to get out of the closet we feel inside.  Even in places its not safe to do so we still want to come out.  Its that true person inside us needing to be free.  So parents and the rest of the world really.  Your not losing who you knew your learning more about who they are on top of what you knew and that's amazing.  Now I do not recommend coming out and placing yourself in danger only you can decide when its right.  You will never truly be happy until break free and fly though.

"Can we talk a bit about de-transitioning, and the politics surrounding it?",9CatsInATrenchcoat,ainbow,"So, today I saw a news piece on de-transitioning and how it's already being used as a tool to further disenfranchise trans people, particularly trans youth.  
Others, in particular some of the de-transitioners  argue that there need to be further policies in place to prevent someone from transitioning too quickly.
As a non-trans person, I'm conflicted as to how I should view this.  Does anyone here have any relevant experience regarding this, and any ideas on how we can protect trans people while at the same time protecting those who misidentify other issues for gender dysphoria?"
Allies,bi_dad48,ainbow,I try to make the majority of my post either positive and uplifting or to point out areas of wrong and in need of change. This post as absolutely uplifting to me.  My nephew and niece both moved in with me after coming out. My nephew whom this post is about has been trying things he's felt drawn to lets say but scared to explore before.  He first wanted to try makeup so we went to Sephora first a few people thought we were pranking them the others seemed to privileged to care. No matter my money works at any store.  We then went to ulta omg big difference. Mandy was so nice and accepting. She found out his skin type talked about how detailed he wanted to try she gave him basic instructions and what brushes to use it was amazing for him.  Next we went to try on clothes and again found a wonderful employee to help.  Zoe was fantastic she has a sister who was amab so she understood his needs.  She measured for the right size and helped him with a few things he was interested in trying. He was so happy when we got home its amazing the change in this kid.  He doesn't know if he's trans he's still sorting that out but he's got support regardless. Guys we need allies like these two who support and appreciate our struggles.  I want to be sure our allies know we appreciate all they do in our fight. Thank you allies for all you do.

Parents wake up,bi_dad48,ainbow,"First let me say I know the ones that need to hear this are not on this app, but maybe just maybe someone will show them them the post.  I know wishful thinking.  40 % at least that's the last report i can find please correct if wrong. That's the percentage of homeless youth with the LGBTQIA+ youth community. That means that instead of being understanding and supportive their parents chose religious or personal belief over their children. Instead of researching and understanding what your child told you you kept your mind closed and forced them to leave convincing yourself they made the choice not you. When your child asked to try on clothes different than their asab you dismissed them and made them feel invalid. Your children just like every other member of the community myself included had to conquer a lot of fear and confusion to get the courage to tell you their feelings and you responded by kicking us out. We were or are homeless. You don't know what kids go through just to survive digging through garbage for food begging for money or food and yes even those things you don't want to imagine we did or are doing just to survive. There are not enough shelters or places for them to go to be warmed and fed.  Parents who don't kick their kids out but ridicule them and chastise them daily as if this is a choice they made are no better. Parents let me show you how this should go. Child: Hey mom dad i need to talk you.  Parents:  sure what is it.  Child: I'm gay bi lesbian pan trans etc. Parents: wow that's amazing it took a lot of courage to tell us that we love you and support you will you help us understand everything about it. Or in the mall son: hey mom I know i need new clothes but I wanted to know if I can try shirts and skirt's from the girls dept.  Mom: absolutely if you would be more comfortable in them should I refer to you as she/ her.  Son: yeah try it if you don't mind. Mom: sure and I tell you what lets get our nails done while were out.  Your child would have been happy and still at home if you could have just done this instead.  My DM's are open if anyone needs to talk."

I don't know if these are signs he likes me,gymfriendlygymdude,ainbow,"There is this guy in my building at uni. I always, in and outside the building, catch him glancing at me. When we are walking towards each other in the hallway, I look up, and hes looking at me. 

This one time we saw each other from a distance as he was cycling away. When he noticed me, he turned his head back a few times just to glance at me.

A few times in the elevator, hed turn to look at me then look away. In uni, no one looks at me as much as he does. I'm not complaining. To be honest, I do think he is good looking.

My friend joined the same course with him. So my friend is the junior and he is the senior. This one time I waved at my friend while he was walking with the guy and the guy (who ive never spoken to before) asked him how we knew each other.

Are these signs this guy like me? And before someone says ""why don't you just ask?"" well it is because I'm actually in an East Asian country where being lgbt is not as widely accepted as in other parts of the world."

Proud dad,bi_dad48,ainbow,So im taking all the kids(my 2 daughters and my niece and nephew) in my house to pride this year (yes we're all vaccinated yes we'll be wearing mask's in case a karen is reading this).  My youngest daughter who is bi came to me and asked if she could invite this girl to go with her. I know the girl shes in my daughters grade and she's lesbian her parents are super supportive as well and of course I said yes. As we talked I got the impression shes interested in this girl.  I asked her and she said yes. I suggested she call the girl and ask her on a date and if its goes well that's when she should invite her. They're going on their first date tomorrow shes so excited shes doing the whole gotta pick the perfect outfit thing.   Im so glad they feel comfortable with telling me these things. I can't imagine how parents can be so stiff necked their kids can't even talk to them. I think pride is going to be such a positive experience for all of them. They can see how open we should be able to be when we're LGBTQIA+.  I look forward to the day we can all be free to be ourselves. My DM'S are open.

My straight friend has a crush on me?,michaelme2021,ainbow,"(Before I begin - for some context: For added context: He is Black, and I am Black + Native mix. Also, I am often referred to as ""pretty"", and accidentally misgendered sometimes. One of my friends said that I have a ""natural pre-op"" look . lol Here is my pic -&gt; [pic](https://uploadir.com/u/e9ejj83n) )

OK, so this all started out with a new coworker. Very attractive guy - and I noticed that he was always staring at me. Either he was turning his head away quickly when I caught him looking or he'd actually just sitting back staring with no shame lol. I didn't pay it much mind cuz I know a lot of people who just stare at others for no reason. Doesn't mean he's admiring your beauty or anything. Well, we got to know each other more, and he let me know he'd like to come down to Atlanta (I moved) to see me and spend a weekend at my place .....

Once he began his trip down here he definitely started opening up more. Started telling me how he thought I was Trinidadian when he first saw me (a mixed Black + Indian person), and eventually shared with me that his type of girl is Black + Indian mix. Then, let me know that he wants a girl who has my hair. It's now clear to me that he admires my beauty in some way LOL. And it's more likely the reason he was staring at me all those times.

However, I'm still inclined to believe that he's a straight man who just has an innocent guy crush. I mean, gay men crush on beautiful women all the time - and admire their beauty. Doesn't mean we want to sleep with them! LOL There was just ONE super awkward moment while he stayed with me over the weekend....He walked into my bedroom shirtless and laid on the futon next to my bed. It was weird cuz he is usually super sensitive to the AC (anytime it fell below 70 degrees in my place he was shivering) , and the AC was blasting that morning.....So why the need to go shirtless? lolllll. Just super awkward.

But then again, even if he was tryna put on a lil show for me, maybe he just wanted a compliment too. I'm trying to just think of every possible reason behind everything. I think it's just an innocent guy crush . He's coming back to spend another weekend with me in July. When he left last time, I texted him, ""I miss you already &lt;3"" soon as he hit the airport and he texted back ""That made my day. I miss you too."" What do you think?"

Hey society fuck you,bi_dad48,ainbow,I've read so many posts here and also on other LGBTQ apps I used of people especially young people who are being criticized and even ostracized because they want to dress different than their asab.  I am so sick and tired of young people being bullied and harassed all because they choose to express their true selves. Society and even parents thinks its right to stop them.  Society thinks boys can't be feminine and girls can't be masculine(im using gender for illustration purposes only).  Boys listen im telling you its ok if you like dresses and leggings and the cute shoes and the makeup etc. I know society will tell you no and you may live in areas where you can't but if you safely can then wear what you want and tell society to kiss your ass.  Girls if you want to wear jeans and hoodies or work boots or short hair etc and look more masculine go for it like before especially if you can safely do so don't hide who you are simply because its not seen as normal by the heteros. Now if you're wanting to fully transition your parents have to be on board if under 18 and unfortunately its going to take changing laws for that. I think puberty blockers should be available to give you time to decide and keep your bodies from changing until you do it will help some with dysphoria but again laws have to change. Until then keep dressing like you want in spite of society. My DM'S are open if you need to talk

Your confusion,bi_dad48,ainbow,Not just here but other apps I use I see a lot of post like am I still bi or pan or gay or asexual etc. Hopefully this will help however this icy opinion others may have a different view that's ok please add anything you wish.  Here's my take from many years as a member of the community. Now remember im 48 I've been out for 34 years. I remember when we only used 4 letters LGBT so I've seen a lot added and have came to understand the true diversity within our community. With that being said use whatever labels your comfortable with and feel right to you. Personally speaking if you identify as male for instance and have came out as bi but you look back and you only dated women 5% of the time so what if you still feel bi your bi. Same with gender if you feel female but present as male more but you feel more comfortable as female your female.  The idea that you have to meet certain criteria to call yourself something is absurd to me. Truth is im more gay than bi but because I do find all genders romantically and sexually appealing I say im bi.  Don't stress out to much on it. Its not required to be 100% or nothing this is about being comfortable and confident in who you are and that's the only opinion that matters. So forget about the confusion and be happy love who you want how you want and screw the others opinions lol.  My DM'S are open for talk.

Ugh homophobia,bi_dad48,ainbow,So me and this guy im dating were at dinner the other day at this nice restaurant in town. We were having a good time and enjoying ourselves you know how dates go laughing and talking touching hands that kinda thing. I happen to look around and saw several people staring in disgust and whispering. Now I've long since got to where I don't let it bother me because I see it all the time getting my toenails painted but was curious if anybody else thinks like this when it happens. Me personally I would rather you go ahead and say what you're thinking and lets get it over with. To me that's less rude than staring and whispering the whole time. Like asshole I know you're whispering about us. This one elderly couple just really kept looking at us in disgust even asked the manager if we could be moved not them move us move.  So when we finished we ran into them at valet parking our car was brought around first as I was getting in i looked at them and said you better get used to seeing same sex couples because we're not going anywhere.

TW: hate,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Hate!  We've all experienced it at sometime in our lives. Whether its a simple you won the game so your brother says I hate you to genuine deep seeded hate that's been poured into someone for years. No body likes hate yet I would say the majority of people in the world have felt it towards someone at least once and yet it continues. For years this country and others have fought against racism(black lives matter) against African Americans specifically to get them equality. Yet racism continues because some people still view them as less than human. Same goes for any people of color Asian, Latino, Native American etc. Some people still think if you're not white then you don't deserve rights. Now its LGBTQIA+ as well. They hate you because of your sexuality. They hate you for how you dress etc. They look at you as less than human to. They think because you don't love and marry like they do you don't deserve rights. The list goes on hatred is so deep rooted like a weed its hard to kill and chokes out all the good in people. It blinds us to the truth which is WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL NO ONE PEOPLE IS BETTER THAN ANOTHER.  You don't have to suffer alone when you have experienced hate against you.

TW: (HOMOPHOBIA),bi_dad48,ainbow,"I had a lady today yell from her car ""we don't need f***s  around here.  Now I was wearing a pink dress shirt other than that nothing LGBTQ related. I yelled back honey there's more here than you think already. That got me to thinking. Society really does associate certain colors and styles to gender. Her only indicator I might be gay or whatever was the color of my shirt. Why does clothing or any damn thing have to be  genderized(made up word btw) . Why can't it all be gender neutral and let us decide what we like.  I don't need society deciding what's for men or women. If I like a pink floral blouse i should be able to wear it without someone saying you know that's a ladies shirt don't you. Lets keep it simple.  Make all size lables uniform so there's no confusion. There should not be a difference in a large from gender to gender a large is a large now period. No longer have a men's women's or boys or girls department just have adult clothing and children's clothing departments. Get away from masculine and feminine descriptions like that's a very manly truck etc.  I mean roman soldiers wore skirt's to fight in the Irish and Scottish men wear kilts why can't dresses and pants be gender neutral. If I wanted to wear a skirt because its cooler in should be able to. Why must we be insulted because pink is considered girly.  Wear what you want and be happy."
Any advice for dressing more feminine as a guy?,James_ca15,ainbow,"Hey Ive been exploring my indenture recently and I really enjoy the feminine clothing aspect. Issue is that I dont own any feminine clothes and cant get any because I dont have the money and am to scared to go outside.

Pretty much, any advice for making standard, masc clothing look more feminine. I essentially made myself a skirt which I really liked but idk what else to do.
I have a load of sweatshirts and jeans and button up shirts and even some Adidas joggers but what do I do with them?

If it helps, heres some info about my size and that. Im about 61 or something above that, pretty big build, naturally look very masc.

We all fight differently but we fight,bi_dad48,ainbow,"If you look at history in the wars that have been fought you will see all types of fighting. From those who were actually in the front lines engaged in physical combat to those behind the scenes making plans and working on factories to build what was needed. The same is true for social injustice when we fight. Everyone wishes for peaceful protest and resolutions, however it rarely happens. Martin Luther King called for peaceful protest during the fight for racial injustice but rarely was he met with it. You see whenever the rights of a few are being infringed upon and they start asking for change its the ones who aren't affected by it that want to start the trouble. They don't want change and they try intimidating those who do. The same is true for LGBTQIA+ when the movement started in the 60' s its been met with opposition all the way. People don't like to admit they're wrong. They would rather fight to keep it like it is than admit it was wrong. Hell anyone can look and see slavery was wrong yet they had to fight to end it. The same is true with racism and women's rights and the list goes on. We as proud members of the LGBTQIA+ community are going to have to fight and yes some of it will most likely be physical. That doesn't mean it will be for everyone but it will for some. Those who just can't physically fight don't worry we need other help to. We need organizing and strategizing. We need posters and shirts and all kinds of propaganda etc.  We all have a part to play in this fight and make no mistake its a fight until change is made. We cannot depend on politicians to do it for us because none of them on either side are concerned about anything other than money. We have to affect the change we need and force them to do what's right."

What am I exactly?,butbuttbuttthey,ainbow,"Im my own special brand... but I dont know where I stand.

Im not the most verbose person out there so I guess Im going to lay this out in list format. I guess I should add that Im male and 26. 

1. My main sexuality is that I have a diaper fetish. Not going to try to explain this here. If you have questions look it up. This has been part of my life as far as I can remember.

2. Im very strongly attracted emotionally to females, in my mind theyre just so insanely cute and like gods on earth. Im also attracted to them physically, but I guess not in a typical way? Id never describe a woman as sexy but just insanely cute.

3. I love looking at penises. Especially small ones. Probably because Im both small and grower. Id love to play with somebodys small penis and be played with.

What am I? I always considered myself to be straight because I only want to be in a relationship with a woman, but as she the years go by and I havent been with one Im realizing that Im not exactly straight. Im not super with the terms and want to put a term to what I am. Am I heteroflexible, bisexual, queer, something else?"
The closet,bi_dad48,ainbow,"The closet a dark and safe space where as kids we would hide from monsters or hide during hide and seek. We always thought it was a good spot a safe spot. Its why the LGBTQIA+ community said we were in the closet for so many years. We felt we couldn't come out to where we could be found for fear of harm or in some cases death. We had to hide what we did and who we were with because it wasn't""normal"". Society preferred it that way so they didn't have to deal with us. That is until one day in 1960 some of us came out of the closet. They had hid long enough and it was time to be seen. Society flipped they wanted us to remain silent and hidden. They wanted us to have no rights. When we started coming out they got worried why because they realized there were more of us than they thought. They made laws to keep us down and in jail but we stayed out we didn't go back in. A lot of change was brought about because a small few came out and stood there ground. Can you imagine what would happen if we all came together and stood our ground for change. A single drop of rain can cause a ripple in a lake a multitude of rain can overflow its banks and cause damage. Its time we overflow our banks and shake up the world and cause everlasting change. Fear will keep you in the closet because its uncomfortable to change the norm. I say fuck fear normal is for losers."

Why we fight,bi_dad48,ainbow,We fight for the right to be treated equally. We fight for the right to live in peace. We fight for the right to be seen as human beings and not evil creations. We fight for the child who realized they were born in the wrong body so they don't have to her afraid to change. We fight for the teenager who's parents kicked them out so no other teen has to suffer that. We fight for the young adults who thought once they got out of school it would be easier. We fight for the middle agers who want to be their true selves everywhere but social norms force them to hide at work or church to avoid being ostracized. We fight for the senior citizens who have seen change but know its still got to get better. We fight for ourselves because of the bullying and homophobia and transphobia etc.  We fight so those coming behind us will have no fear. We fight day and night without waiver so no one is ever mistreated again.

Im so confused,doverthecat,ainbow,"(she/her) 

Ive always had the thought in the back of my head that I wasnt straight. Ive never felt much attraction to men and think Ive felt attraction towards women. The thing is, Ive never felt romantic interest towards anyone. I want to be in a relationship, so Im pretty sure Im not aro, but I just dont get crushes on people. Im pretty young (14) but I feel like I should have developed at least some sort of interest in someone, even a celebrity. But no, just attraction, not romantic feelings.  Im currently in a safe position to come out to my family (my friends know Im questioning) and feel uncomfortable keeping a secret from my parents. But, I have horrible anxiety and only want to come out once if I can, so I really need to find a label that fits. I currently identify as a lesbian but dont quite know if that fits yet. Help!"
"Dear biphobes, even if bisexuality did exclude NB people (wich it dosn't) so what of it!",Clay_teapod,ainbow,"I've been thinking, the NB spectrum is still a gender, so what's so bad about not being attracted to it?  I mean, we've got a sexuality in wich you are only attracted to NB people, and I don't see anyone hating on it because 'it excludes binary people' or some shit. So woudn't it make sense to have a sexuality in wich you are only attracted to binary genders? What's so wrong about that? Just because someone isn't attracted to them does it mean thay don't support them, that's just a plain stupid mindset when you think about it, like, so now a straight guy hates dudes or what?   ""Bisexual people are enbyphobic"" no, if we mistake \[not liking X gender\] with \[hating on X gender\] we won't stay as a community, and is a completly illogical argument.

&amp;#x200B;

So at the end, even if bisexuality excluded NB people, yeah, we like binary genders, keep scrolling, or are you saying NB people are still their genitalia? that they aren't of a completly diferent gender? Idk man, seems pretty enbyphobic to me."

Its worth it,bi_dad48,ainbow,I have said and will continue to say do not come out kids if its not safe to do so. That is of utmost importance. That being said there is power in coming out. There's a freedom of declaring and claiming who you are. Do you run the risk of isolation from family yes but you're isolated anyway if your hiding who you are. Do you run the risk of being bullied yes but your most likely already being bullied for being different let them know the real reason why you're different. Could you experience hate yes but we see it every day anyway. Despite all of that and more to me it was  worth it. My identity meant something when I was fighting for equal rights because they knew I was one of the LGBTQIA+ and i was tired of injustice. You see if we stay in the closet simply because we're uncomfortable they win and im not trying to minimize anyone's fears but sometimes we have to overcome them to live. When I speak as a proud bisexual man my voice is heard. When I tell my Co workers who I am despite what they believe i grow bolder. When my family realizes kicking me out was the best thing that ever happened and their the ones who missed out on an amazing son im empowered to press on. We  will not rest until LGBTQIA+ is normalized not criminalized or marginalized. Is coming out tough and require sacrificing you bet but its worth every damn bit of it to me!

Creating a #pride slide for work -- need help!,BecomingJess,ainbow,"So I work at a smallish tech company based out of Boston/NYC. We've had a lot of new hires in the past year, and with June just around the corner I spoke to our HR person about including a Pride slide in the June all hands meeting.

But now I need to figure out what to put in it! We have a #pride slack channel that will get a bit of promotion with this, but I wanted to provide additional useful information about Pride, the LGBTQIA+ community, and how folks don't need to be a part of the community themselves to support it.

It'll probably be one slide but I might be able to get two, though if I get enough to do two she'll probably have me do the talking (pro: I get to provide more information; con: I have to talk ). I want to try to focus on inclusivity and education; keeping it fun/entertaining but still at least ""business casual"" level of professional, it *is* a workplace.

Anything would be appreciated: singular tidbits, websites and informational resources, even other presentations you've given or seen that fit the bill."
Valid,bi_dad48,ainbow,"I want to remind you you're valid. You aren't insignificant. Your gender and sexuality are yours and they're not to be dismissed.   Its ok that its not what society says its normal they've been brainwashed by years of wrong teaching's and backwooods thinking. Everywhere you look in nature there is some form of same sex mating and we are no different. No matter how much we have tried to change its still there proving its not a choice. So what do we do do we sit quietly in the shadows and hope one day society will just change? No! Anything worth believing in is worth fighting for. Real change in the world has always been brought about by those willing to stand up and say enough! We're no longer going to be ignored. Slavery had to go but it took fighting. Racism has to go and its taking fighting and don't be fooled its still a problem(black lives matter).  And if the lgbtqia+ wants to move forward its going to take fighting. Not necessarily physical fighting though it could but rather being the change and standing up from right where you are. I know in some cases its not safe to do so I get that, but if its just a matter of life being uncomfortable if you do isn't a little discomfort worth equality. Now adults especially have to be willing to be out and be outspoken. We can't worry anymore about what our coworkers will think it's time we became heard for who we are. Kids and teens that choice is yours if its safe to do so or you feel you can handle it then you be heard to. By ourselves we may not be heard but together we can make a shout heard around the world. We are valid and its time the world knew it!"

I feel qualified to speak about my own Bi-ness and hopefully I can do justice to the topic as a representative of the LGBTQ+ community.

I've made a list of different sexual identities and I'm going to get them to pair them with their definitions as a puzzle.

Given that I don't know what everything and everyone, I'm asking what labels you'd like me to share with this group of therapists so that they won't look quite so baffled when they meet someone who wants to talk about this stuff."

"Enby here, does anyone else feel strangely bothered when trans people say ""I wish I was born cis""",Clay_teapod,ainbow,"I'm kinda jelous to be honest, they get to wish the opposite body and be happy, I don't know what my ideal body even is. I woudn't ve happy even if I was born the oposite sex. I know it sounds twisted, sick, and wrecked, that it's not that simple, but just ranting here.   I mean,  we could never get gendered correctly by society, there was never a chance for us to be cisgender from the start, so good for you if you wished you were born cis, so do I, dumb luck there's no way that could ever happen"
Just want to put a little light back into the world!!,brokenandtired1,ainbow,"Hey lovely people of the world, fellow queer here and I just want to let everyone know that I've officially started my podcast ""one time for a good time!"" It's on all streaming services and it has its very own YouTube channel but first  I want to tell you guys why I started this. Personally for the last eight years of my life, I suffered from depression, self loathing, insecurities etc. And with that, I knew absolutely nothing about self love, self worth or even happiness. A year ago I knew I had to change my ways or it was going to be over for me. So I started a mission of digging up all my skeletons and properly burying them where they belong and I just want to say this last year and a half have been extraordinary and I finally see the light. I no longer cry at night and I feel true happiness every day. But with mental health, depression and self harm, I knew I wasn't the only person out there in the world feeling these things and having these thoughts, so I decided to make ""One time for a good time"" because even through my roughest of time. I knew how good it would have felt to walk with someone through all of the darkness and I want to be that for people. The person people can come to in the darkest of times and get advice, laugh or listen to me tell a stupid story. There's too many people out there struggling with mental health and I want to do my part in the world by getting this podcast out there and saving others. I hope this can help one of you out there or Maybe you know someone you can send it too but life is too short and I think we should spend our waking hours having fun and living our best lives.

Who am I,bi_dad48,ainbow,All of us most likely have asked ourselves that question. No doubt some time in your life a stranger or distant family or teacher may have asked. Like most people it caused to start thinking who am I really. Im a firm believer that you are not locked in to just what your birth certificate says. Names and genders and sexuality can be changed or be fluid. There should be no need for you to hate who you are except society has deemed it not normal. That's easy for them for they've never struggled with looking in the mirror disgusted by their bodies because the body doesn't match how you feel. They've never dealt with the depression that comes when no one in your family takes you seriously about it. They've never once dealt with being forced to live a lie every day. Its not easy being different in society. Im also a believer to that you're more than what's on your birth certificate to. You're not just genetics you have a personality and feelings and knowledge and so much more that's stays with you throughout your journey so look deep inside and become your fully true self outside and inside. Who are you? Your you and the world better get ready.
I don't know how to feel...,The_Nichomancer,ainbow,"I was talking to my stepmother last night, and my stepmother is... certainly not conventional in the way she ""supports"" LGBT people. My stepmother outright said she believes conversion therapy works, and she believes that sexual orientation changes over time because she's known some people who identified as gay but are now dating or with the opposite sex. She gave an example of how my stepuncle (or her brother) loves to date men, but he doesn't want to anymore because he got shot in a homophobic attack. He now has a wife, and he says he only wants to be with women. A big problem is, though, my stepmom uses ""gay"" and ""bisexual"" interchangeably. I asked her ""So, is he gay or is he bisexual?"", and she said ""He's bisexual."", but she ALWAYS calls bisexual people ""gay"".

Furthermore, she said she had an uncle who was confident in being gay, but she said that he became a pastor and found a woman whom he fell deeply in love with and now he said he no longer has a desire for men. This is all too confusing for me because my stepmother LOVES to claim that she is supportive of the LGBT community, but all this rhetoric so strongly sounds like something that homophobes would use to push an agenda. I was initially scared to talk to her about this subject, and I outright said it. I stated ""This is why I was scared to talk to you. The talking points you use are awfully similar to what anti-gay people use."", and then she went on to use emotional manipulation and to say how rude it is for me to say that and how I'm only saying it not because I genuinely believe it but because I said things that she disagreed with and wanted to make her feel bad. She does stuff like this all the time where she tells a person exactly how she feels because she thinks her having a psychology degree makes her a mind reader for some reason.

We also got into the topic of transgender people, and oh boy, even though I'm cis, I couldn't help but feel bad about this one. She said that ""Trans people only exist because of gender roles."", but I vehemently defended the idea that trans people would still be trans even if they were born on an island with no one else around them. I made my case for as to why gender identity is innate, but then she says that gender identity only exists when you have something to compare it to (i.e. you can't know you don't want a penis unless you actually know what a vagina is). It struck me the wrong way too when she outright said that she doesn't believe that transition is a proper treatment for gender dysphoria. She loves to say that transition isn't a helpful form of treatment and will so strongly claim that transition doesn't help gender dysphoria.

My stepmom says she does her research. After she found out about my identity and my stepsister's identity (my stepsister is also bi, openly has dated both men and women, but my stepmom still insists on calling her ""gay""), she says she looked into knowing a lot better about this, but I'm not sure what sources she's getting this from. She loves to say that trans identity and sexual orientation are not set in stone and change a lot over time. I did bring up genderfluid people when she said this, but she said ""They only exist because they can't make up their mind."", and I just felt really awful about this entire conversation. I don't feel like my stepmother is genuinely supportive of LGBT people. She can claim whatever she wants about how her """"""gay"""""" family members are people she supports, but at the end of the day, she clearly knows so little.

I don't like talking to my stepmother for advice, but she tries to open her door for me. The problem is that she has a lot of ignorant ideas, and she can't separate fact from opinion. For example, if I try to say to her ""Well, there's a difference between a fact, an opinion, and a falsehood. Believing that the idea of trans people is born out of gender roles is just an objective falsehood. Not everything is subjective."", but then she proceeds to say ""BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE SO IT'S ONLY AN OPINION."" I find that ""opinion"" is such a misused word. Another example of this is that if I said ""Extraterrestrial life is real."", that wouldn't be an ""opinion"". Just because we have yet to prove whether the statement is true or false, doesn't make it an opinion. Aliens are either real or not, and they can't be real and nonexistent at the same time, so the statement is either true or false, yet unknown.

Am I in the wrong for not wanting to talk to my stepmother again after this, especially regarding the topic of LGBT identity? I don't know. You tell me. :/"

Opinion,bi_dad48,ainbow,What its your opinion on LGBTQ and religion specifically Christianity mainly but all are ok to.  Now Im not talking about the homophobic version of religion. Im talking about affirming religion. One where the mistranslations have been corrected and the God of love is taught and preached.  You see I used to be an ordained minister but I could no longer preach when I had more question than answers.  I sought the answers but only got standard answers like its not meant for us to understand. Now I know its hard to imagine a bisexual preacher but I shamefully hid it because I was good a preaching too good evidently because I taught myself right if it. I thought I would never be able to go to church or preach again. That was until I found out that in 1946 the word homosexual was mistranslated and erroneously added to the bible. Now I know the old world churches most of them were trying to control what we learned. I would gladly start an LGBTQ affirming church if I thought I could get enough members. I personally still believe in God I just find it hard to worship where there's hate and people are excluded. Church should be about love and helping our fellow man not hurting people who are different.

My youngest daughter came out as bisexual a few weeks ago followed shortly thereafter by her cousins who are now living with me. We are all planning to go to the pride events in Atlanta. I have only been to Pride as an adult and have primarily participated in the adult oriented events. I would love to hear if any of you have been as kids teenagers specifically or if you have kids and have taken them before what did you do. I know there's events there for them just wondering what we really need to do. I want to be sure they have a good time.

Struggles,bi_dad48,ainbow,The cishet's will never understand the struggles lgbtqia+ youth and adults face on a daily basis. They don't know what its like to have anxiety daily going to school or work because you never know how people will react.  As youth we have gut wrenching fear daily that someone will out us before we're ready. Fear that our parents will find out and kick us out. Fear of being beaten up yet again because we're different. Depression because we have to live a lie another day. Anger because we're not accepted. Loneliness because we can't talk to anyone who understands what we're going through. Disgust when we look in the mirror and don't like what we see. Confusion when we try to look more feminine or more masculine from our agab and so on. These struggles continue even into adulthood. We're still considered different so we're still not accepted. Now I know heterosexual people face struggles to but in comparison its not like our struggles. The suicide and homelessness rates among LGBTQ youth is astonishing. Yet society still shuns us. We long for the day we all live in harmony equally. I wish I could adopt or start a group home for kids to have a safe place to go. More work needs to bed done to protect these who are most vulnerable of us.  My DM'S are open if you need to talk.

Hello all above is a link to this post on r/charity. I am a part of a lovely community of twitch streamers and every so often we all come together in support of raising funds for charities, and we all came together and decided upon The Trevor Project this time around (https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) the leading national organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer &amp; questioning (LGBTQ) young people under 25. This is a charity that all of us feel very passionate about and believe to be very helpful for LGBTQ+ youth around America. Starting on Friday May the 14th at 1pm PST through to Sunday May the 16th at 7pm PST there will be a streamer online on their respective channel. If you would like to come by and hang out you can locate the active streamer at (https://www.twitch.tv/datcomraidtrain?sr=a).
It's sure to be a ton of fun and everyone is going to be doing their own thing during the time slot. I hope you all have an absolutely blessed weekend and thank you."
Gender sexuality and labels oh my,bi_dad48,ainbow,"So my kids and I were talking last night about a lot of things related to lgbtqia+. Naturally as teens they have a lot of questions. One thing they all had questions about was what if im wrong about my pronouns or I thought I was this sexuality but now I think I might be this etc.  I told them first in my opinion don't worry about labeling yourself if you're not that concerned with them.  You are not obligated to bed labeled its not a requirement.  If however you need to know what to label yourself because I know it can be important to some,  then remember this sexuality and gender are fluid,  they can change so don't stress if you find out you've changed and you already came out. Its perfectly acceptable to tell people I was bisexual but I've realized im actually pan or whatever you want to use a an example. Hell I went from bi to pansexual so don't worry it happens. The main thing is you be you and live your best life. Now our conversation was longer and more detail than this I condensed it down for here but please add to or comment your opinion we can all learn from each other"
"Does anybody else find it ironic how transphobes say ""A man is always a man!"" in response to trans women, but as soon as a cisgender male wears a skirt, these bigots turn around and say ""Are there no more real men?"", is if to suggest that a mere piece of cloth can change a person's gender.",sorcerykid,ainbow, 
Pissed and ecstatic at the same time,bi_dad48,ainbow,Ok so quick recap for anyone who may not know. My niece and nephew came out to their parents and we're kicked out of the house and are now living with me. Today their parents showed up Worcester preacher and the police at my work. They accused me first of kidnapping little did they know we have videoed the whole transaction at their house that night for it proved they kicked them out the police quickly left. Them in the preacher however State and they brought the preacher to try to convince me that what the kids were doing was wrong. He however did not realize I used to be a preacher I had studied the gospels and the word at new just as much as he did the only difference was I knew it correctly and shut him down at every turn. When he finally had to admit he did not know what he was talking about and that yes there had been mistranslations in the Bible they left it said the kids could just stay with me now all I got to do is get them to sign guardianship papers.

Pride,bi_dad48,ainbow,Well after all the serious discussions last night we finally started having some fun discussions. We decided to plan some trips and activities for the summer just to make life a little more exciting and kind of get the kids Minds off everything that had been going on . After talking with my kids and niece and nephew last night we decided we're all going to pride in Atlanta this year. I think it will be good for them to experience all the positivity associated with pride. They can interact with other people their age who are part of the community as well as experience great events. I have been many times by myself and have really enjoyed it. Those who have been before are there any events for teenagers there I've only been as an adult and have only experienced that side of it. I want them to really have a good time and see that LGBTQ is not just about being bullied and hated all the time. Its about love and acceptance and the freedom to be yourself.  I think after everything that they have been through this will show them the positive side of who they are. My Hope Is that they will come away from this event knowing that they have done the right thing and what is best for themselves. Even my oldest daughter who is Ike straight Ally is going because she has been such a big supporter in my life and now in her sister and cousins life. This will be her first event as well and I think she is as excited as everyone else is.
"Um, hi",mistermysteryboi,ainbow,"Hello Reddit. I can't say I am surprised I am here. I honestly don't know how to start this. I'm gay. I'm 20. I have massive social anxiety. Anyways, I have an issue. Lately, I've been going to this fast-food place near my house to see this really nice guy who works at the window. I think he's really sweet. I don't really know what he looks like underneath the mask, but nonetheless I go there almost everyday and order one thing on the menu. Lemonade. Side tracking, I love lemonade. Turns out the lemonade there is really good, so I have an excuse to keep going.

Anyways, the first day I went I was having a really bad day. I had been feeling unnecessarily lonely because I have been single for a while and I have my own fair share of insecurities that don't help in that matter. I wasn't expecting to pull up to the window and be greeted by someone so nice. He had on this mask that I think is super cool. It's something from an anime I love to watch. So, I complimented his mask. Normally I would never do that in fact I would have just stayed quiet the entire time, but I guess my own excitement caught me by surprise. He said thank you and we shared a small conversation which I enjoyed a lot more than I should have. I was happy that someone was taking an interest in me, even if it was just his job to be kind to people who come up to the window. It left me with a nice feeling in my stomach and a smile on my face. At first, I didn't think much of it, just that it left a good impression on me that *I actually had the courage to do what I did*. Two days went by and I went by again. I wanted food and also I wanted to try the lemonade they had, plus I wanted to see the nice guy at the window. This time, my friend was in the car, and I had told him all about how I thought the guy at the window was sweet and I ranted on about the conversation we had (even though it was like 3 minutes long) and he smiled at me. We made jokes about the guy and he kept saying ""Oh, it's your future husband"" and I just laughed and replied with ""No, I don't even know him don't make it weird"" or something along those lines. When we ordered our food and glorious lemonade, we got to the window and I asked how he was this time, striking up conversation. He said he was good and that he was excited that in 2 days he wouldn't have to work, and that he was working a lot saving up for something he wanted to buy. I don't really remember what I said, because I was so nervous about the actual conversation itself, I possibly just blurted out gibberish. Luckily, my friend, who was sitting next to me, said to the guy ""Wow, I really like your eyes,"" and he smiled and thanked my friend for the compliment then he handed us the food and drinks and we left. I had to park in the parking lot because I was starting to have a mental breakdown. My friend had to keep reassuring me that the conversation went fine and that it was natural and it seemed like the guy at the window was receptive. I know it seems dramatic, but social anxiety, for me, almost controls me. I've had to leave classrooms or public settings to go cry in the bathroom, so for me to do this is like torture. Yet, everyday I find myself going back, wanting more. Trying to be better so that I can talk to him with confidence. I went back the following day, which was two days ago. 

Two days ago, at midnight, I was driving back from my friends house and I felt good, so I decided it was time to try and do better. I felt confident that I could say more so I ordered a lemonade (obviously) and got to the window. Since it was late there was no one behind me in line and it seemed like he was the only one working at that hour. I asked how he was, he said ""Good, just excited that I have the day off tomorrow"" and I just replied with ""Nice."" and then he went to go get my lemonade.  While he was putting the lid on the cup I say to him ""I never get to see a bed, I'm always roaming about the city or working."" and he said ""Same. In my 26 years of living I only manage to sleep a total of 4 hours each night."" or something about not sleeping more than 4 hours (It's hazy in my brain, I'm sorry!!). I laughed and said ""That's life"" and then he handed me the lemonade and as I grabbed it I just said ""Do you like boardgames?"" Him: ""Yea, I do"" Me: ""Do you wanna come to like a boardgame club-thing that me and my friends do, sometime?"" Him: ""Umm, yea sure. Why not?"" Me: ""Cool! Let me give you my number."" and because I was so nervous at this point I was fumbling around in my car panicking, trying to find paper. He started printing out some receipt paper and was like ""Do you need some paper?"" and I was like ""Nah, I got it"" and found one all whilst trying not to think about how dumb I probably looked. My hand was shaking so bad, but I wrote down my number on the paper nonetheless and gave it to him. He then asked me ""What's your name?"" and then I said it's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and he was like well my name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ then stuck his hand out the window and said ""It's nice to meet you."" and I smiled and said ""It's nice to meet you too."" shaking his hand. It was big and soft. Before I left he said ""I'll give you a call."" and it kinda made me all giddy so I smiled again and said goodnight and left. 

I'm not sure if maybe I am overstepping. Or being creepy. He hasn't called, and my anxieties tell me not to go back to the fast-food place because he probably thinks I'm dumb or is telling his co-workers about this gay guy who keeps coming to harass him or something. They probably make it a game to see how many times I come and then laugh when I leave. Maybe he's homophobic or has someone already. Perhaps he's just being kind because it's his job. I do go there to get lemonade, genuinely. I love the lemonade there, even if he wasn't working there I would probably still go there anyways to get it. Now, I would honestly just rather never go back. Plus, what if he see's this. If he did I wouldn't even drive in the vicinity of that place. I'll move to a different city. Joking. But you get the idea. 

My friends have been so encouraging and kind. When I told them I gave him my number and invited him to hang-out with us they were so proud and happy. It made me happy. Like I'm on the verge of tears that I even had the balls to do it. They say I'm fearless and straightforward most of the time, and it's only because they are around me, but when it's me and me alone I just hide in my shell. I think I also kinda use this whole thing as an opportunity to be more social without them. As soon as it goes south though, I know I won't try anything like this again. And I guess that's also why I don't want to go back there or keep trying. 

I do want it go good and maybe get a friendship, *or more* out of it. I mean, he is sweet. And he has beautiful eyes. I haven't  gone out of my comfort zone like this for anyone in a long time. The friends I have now have been in my life for more than 5 years. I think that was the last time I went out of my comfort zone ahah. I just need some advice. I need something. I don't know how to cope with my own anxieties or get out of my head. And I guess, this is me asking for some help from anyone."

A great day,bi_dad48,ainbow,"I spent the day with all the kids. My 2 girls and my niece and nephew who if you read previous posts just got kicked out for coming out. Today we worked out sleeping arrangements and setting up closet space. They both packed bags but looks like they will need more clothes. Im excited I love shopping plus will give them and opportunity to try new styles. Then everybody wanted to just talk. So I suggested we go to the family room and we could talk about anything that was bothering them or anything they had questions on. Of course both my niece and nephew were hurt and confused why their parents would act that way. I explained that they still loved them, but that preacher's since 1946 had been teaching against homosexuality based off a mistranslation.  Sadly everyone believed it was right and formed strong opinions. They felt if they were Christians they couldn't accept any sin even if it meant disowning their kid.  I told them its going to take a lot to undo that many years of hurt. Then everyone had questions about their own genders and sexuality and thankfully this old queen had studied up. It was great seeing them understand their feelings and being validated."

LGBT support for Palestine,chesh1re_cat,ainbow,"Since the Israel-Palestine conflict has flared up again I'm seeing a lot of Twitter gays unequivocally supporting the Palestinian side. I can understand a stance that condemns certain actions of the right-wing Israeli government while still acknowledging that Israel has a right to exist and defend itself when attacked. However, so many gay people online are taking a hard-line stance that the Palestinians are entirely innocent and that Israel is the obstacle to peace in the region (even though the Palestinians have rejected every two state solution ever proposed). As a gay man, I'm trying to understand why members of the LGBTQ community would opt to support the side of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, which don't treat gay people with basic human dignity, as opposed to Israel, which (has some ways to go but) is far more liberal and one of the few places in the middle east where it's acceptable to be openly gay? Do they prefer an openly homophobic and misogynistic country in Israel's place? Again, I'm willing to accept a nuanced opinion that criticizes issues on both sides but that's not what I'm seeing amongst the LGBTQ community online, and it seems like they're going all in on the side that still punishes homosexuality by death (at least in the Gaza strip)."
A long night,bi_dad48,ainbow,I have already had a couple of people asking this morning so I thought I would post an update. The kids had a very restless night there was a lot of crying a lot of asking why a lot of wondering if they did the right thing. I comforted them and talked to them most of the night they finally fell asleep around 3 a.m. we all went to bed. I am letting them stay home from school today with excused absences because I just can't send them in the emotional state that they are in the good thing is I'm off work so hopefully for today we can get everybody on a better emotional plane. I knew this was going to be tough and I am mentally prepared. I don't understand how a parent can turn their back on their child. Maybe one of these days I will know why but for now it just Escapes Me. That child is still the same child they were before they came out nothing has changed! If you love them before they come out then you should still love them now dammit!  Together we will get through this and they will be stronger for it I thank everyone for all the kind words they have given over the past 48 hours.

It seems that she asks about it cause she has a crazy theory that I have it small and therefore felt insufficient as a guy and decided to become a trans girl instead.

Biological Male trying to figure out personal Masculine Intersex conundrum,gurpgorkdish,ainbow,"Hi everyone! I'm really new to the community, so I apologize if at any point I'm oblivious about or misuse terminology. 

If the following is sufficiently NSFW/TMI for this place, let me know and I can absolutely delete it as needed. 

So, I (born male) realized recently after a lot of thinking that, as far as I can tell my ideal body would basically be masculine intersex (i.e. male, but with a vagina in addition to current genitals). As far as I and the doctors I've spoken with so far can tell, though, this most likely isn't really medically possible. So I'm not really entirely sure how to reconcile this at this point. I don't feel a particular need or want to use HRT since I'm reasonably comfortable with my masculinity aside from this. I also don't feel particularly comfortable giving up my penis permanently for the sake of getting a vaginoplasty, but this is still something that I really want for myself. What should I do from here?"
How to find gay guys in HS?,Lopsided_Shirt49,ainbow,"Hey all!

I have real trouble finding other gay teenagers. I live in a very accepting and quite liberal area. However, there are very few gay boys (many more girls for some reason). I have been told to use instagram to find people in nearby towns, has this worked for anyone? If so, how do you do it?

Anybody have any advice, it's really getting to me lately. Idk what to do."

My family has grown,bi_dad48,ainbow,Well I just got home from my niece and nephews house where they came out to their parents. I wasn't sure they were prepared enough but they were not gonna wait any longer. They wanted me there for moral support and to offer proof biblically that homosexual wasn't added until 1946. They also needed me to answer questions they couldn't or didn't know. They both were amazing. They explained what they were feeling and how they waited to he sure it wasn't a phase before they talked to them. Their parents to their credit listened to everything they said without interrupting them.  Unfortunately their parents didn't care about the facts. They hit the roof after they kids finished. Telling them they were sinners damned for hell and they weren't going to have that lifestyle in their house.  I had to get between them and the kids to stop them from fighting. They both were given a chance to apologize and say they were straight or pack bags and leave. They both calmly walked upstairs grabbed their packed bags and walked out the door. Now they're living with me and I couldn't be prouder of the way they handled it. I know the next few days will be tough but we'll get through it. I just really need to find a bigger house.
What's the future of outdated gendered categories at award ceremonies?,allthetvgoss,ainbow, 
"What would a non-ableist, non-racist, non-classist, non-sexist, non-LGBTQ+phobic preK-12 school system look like for you?",ThisIsMyRental,ainbow,"Asking because I think the current (US) preK-12 school system is systemically ableist, racist, and classist, and depending on the area sexist, and LGBTQ+phobic as well.

I'm making a master list of everyone's response here as to the characteristics of a non-ableist, non-racist, non-classist, non-sexist, and non-LGBTQ+phobic preK-12 school system in this textpost, and I'll start the list with my personal takes:

-Every student should have mandatory and cost-free to families screenings done through the schools/school districts early and often for at least invisible disabilities, including all the neurodivergencies and learning/intellectual disabilities as well as chronic pain, ME/CFS, asthma, and mental illnesses in addition to the sight and hearing tests that have been done through school districts. Hopefully this would result in far less people struggling because their disabilities went undiagnosed and thus un-accommodated for.

-ABOLISH SCHOOLS GETTING MORE FUNDING FOR MORE ATTENDANCE. Schools shouldn't be reliant on kids coming in when they don't feel well, especially not on kids coming in when (probably) contagious with anything, to be fully-funded!

-The specifically-scheduled dispatch of all required vaccines at school at no cost to the students or families. If possible I'd really like to see all vaccines given in like 2-3 rounds a year with a week's break off school for everyone completely free of ANY homework or long-term project work/""thinking"" requirements after each round of vaccines, with of course free-to-families childcare centers set up for all the kids whose parents have to keep reporting to in-person work. That way, students don't have to worry at all about messing up their attendance, grades, and/or social stuff if they get strong side effects from vaccination(s) like I spent every one of my school years worrying about until 2020, when I decided to get my first-ever flu shot to help not overstress the hospitals during peak COVID.

-Complete abolishment of dress codes beyond what is explicitly and evidently required for safety. Schools don't need to be wasting their time policing how students express themselves. If uniforms are deemed necessary, they are to be completely gender-neutral in what gets offered and/or directed to be worn, ADA-compliant, public safety-compliant, and fully covered by the school (district) so uniforms don't become either something that automatically exposes a student's socioeconomic class or an excuse for schools to police students for bullshit and bigoted reasons.

-Abolishment of having to ""dress out"" in a specific uniform for PE, especially abolishment of having to ""dress out"" for PE without access to private changing stalls. PE is meant to instill a respect for and valuing of regular physical activity, which unfortunately isn't helped by students being exposed to (possible) ableism, other body-related stresses, racism, classism, sexism, LGBTQ+phobia, and overall creepiness by being required to quickly change into a specific PE uniform that costs money in a room full of kids who all have view of each other changing being supervised by an adult who may be a creep who's leering at said kids in order to get full credit for PE. Honestly, PE as a class should really be much more like the traditional ""recess"" of elementary school that also spends a minority of its time educating kids on living overall healthy lifestyles, including maintaining mental health, in ways that don't stress the kids out or add significantly time-consuming amounts of schoolwork onto their plates, than what it is now. PE as it is now mostly just turns kids off exercising for life without serious nutritional or mental health guidance, and we still wonder why the rate of being unhealthily overweight/obese is skyrocketing so much."

Overthinking,mboopifan,ainbow,"I (16F) knew that I was a homosexual (sort of) when I was 12y/o. I didn't really cared much about that back then because  I didn't really know about these lgbt stuff you know. I came to know about all those only when I was 14-ish. I have always had my eyes on women from my childhood, let it be movies or magazines or even on some of my classmates. But back then I thought it was normal for girls to be interested in other girls' bodies because I never really had any girl friends back then. Right from kindergarten I refused to mingle with girls and all of my friends were boys. Even today, majority of my mates that I text and call are guys. I started bonding with my female classmates only after I hit puberty. And I had some temporary crushes on a few of them as well. Though I didn't know about the 'concept' of homosexuality. 

I haven't really  told anybody about my condition except my sister and two male gay friends. My sister(13) practically doesn't care about all that so I'm in a safe place. But for the past year or so I have some doubts about myself. I began asking myself whether I was really homosexual or not. Whether I was deceiving myself and questions in that line of thought.

 And these thoughts have been, and still is, consuming my time, which I should spend on something else. Not a day passes without me thinking about whether I am heterosexual in fact. I'm really getting tired of it but I can't get my mind out of this subject. I really want to go back were I didn't care about these stuff. For the past year, I have been examining my reactions to seeing guys on the TV, whether it's watching football or movies and what not. I'm honestly tired of doing this. I feel like I have become a lesser version of myself during this time. I have not been so productive, and also I was straight A student till 9th grade and now I feel like I'm slowly deteriorating. Whenever I'm studying or doing anything I need to this thought slowly occupies my mind. I can feel it and I know what to do to prevent it  but I can't act upon those. Something inside is stopping me from doing so.

I created a new reddit account today and I decided to write this here, so as to get some insight on this subject. Please guys help me, how do I overcome this situation?

"My girlfriend's homophobic parents won't let us be together, what do I do?",r4cheld,ainbow,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I'm feeling hopeless and have no where else to turn. I (16F) have been with my girlfriend (16F) for about half a year. We met online through some mutual friends and ever since then, we've been inseparable. We spent our time together watching movies, playing Minecraft, talking about life, and basically just doing as much as we could for a long distance relationship. But all that changed about two months ago.

We were on Facetime one day, talking about who knows what, when she suddenly hung up. I got worried that maybe something happened, and made the stupid decision to keep calling her until I got clarification that she was alright. That's when she answered in a panicked tone, saying something along the lines of: ""Hey, my dad wants to talk to you. Dad, this is my friend. Say hi."" I was terrified. I couldn't speak. He grabbed the phone from her and demanded to know who I was. I could hear her sobbing in the background; I didn't know what to do, so I just hung up. I felt so guilty, so scared for her. I kept thinking that if I *just* had stopped calling her, this wouldn't have happened.

If it wasn't obvious, her parents are very Christian and very homophobic. She always told me that even if *God himself* came to this earth and told them it was okay to be gay, they still wouldn't listen. I don't want to talk too much about the situation but essentially, she had to come out to them. They forced her to break up with me and to cut off all contact with me. They told her that she wasn't gay, that she had been possessed by a *demon* and that the only solution was to just read the bible, go to church, and attend bible study groups. (All of which she didn't do before). Her dad literally said that he couldn't handle a gay daughter, and that if she kept this up he was going to get a divorce. She later told me this was one of the most traumatic experiences of her life.

Life was different for the next few weeks, but of course, we didn't stop talking. Our only solution was to talk on a Google Doc, as she was scared that her parents would find out any other way. I could tell she was different, that something within her had changed. But I was in love with her, I still am, how could I leave her like this?

Slowly but surely things started to get better. Her parents became less strict about her free time, (although they still didn't approve of her being gay and still assumed she wasn't talking to me) and we were eventually able to call while her parents were away working and things like that. Things were finally going back to normal, and we both seemed to be healing from the situation that had happened to us. Of course there still was the question of, ""what are we gonna do in the future?"" But she assured me that it'd be ok, and that she just had to get better at hiding me. I agreed, because at the end of the day, I still wanted her. I wanted desperately to be with her.

But of course, the inevitable happened. She got caught again. This time, it was even worse. Her dad told her she had a choice: break up with me, or he would kick her out of the house. I thought the choice was clear, that she should undoubtedly pick her safety over me. But she insisted that it didn't matter if she got kicked out, she still wanted to be with me. I was shocked to say the least. Luckily, she is still safe within her home, but we are back in that numb, confusing place again. We are talking on our Google Doc still, and she said that once we're done with school, she's going to give me the ""breakup I deserve"" over the phone today. I feel physically ill, I can't even *imagine* a life without her in it. I just don't know what to do...

I know that we're just 16, I know that we're young and in love, and that I'll eventually have to get over her, but for that short time, I thought I was going to marry her. That we'd be together for the rest of our lives. She was everything I could have ever asked for and more. It's stupid I know, but feelings like the ones I have for her don't go away that easily. And to think that all this is happening just because we're both girls...

For more information, I'll clarify some things below:

\- My parents are both very supportive and approve of our relationship. They've known about it for about 4 months, and even supported me when I said I wanted to make plans to meet her over the summer.

\- She is an only child and stays at home mostly all day, as she is doing school online. There's really no escape for her except for her bedroom as she's only allowed to stay at home or go out with her approved friends.

I'm just looking for *any* advice on what I can do. Our situation seems hopeless but I want to persevere, I want to at least come out of this dark place as a happier person. I figured that someone may have a similar experience here or can maybe give me some hope. I'd appreciate it so much!"

Wish me luck,bi_dad48,ainbow,"I posted earlier that My niece and nephew came out to me yesterday. Now they want to come out today to their parents and want me too help. I talked to them both last night to make sure they knew it was required to come out at all to them, at least not this soon but both were insisting they were ready. Turns out when they came out to me last night its because they're tired of hiding who they are I get that it can cause a lot of stress on a young person. They want me their to answer questions they can't and hopefully help ease any tension. I talked to them both to make sure they knew I could only help answer questions and get between them and parents if it gets violent but I really don't think it will. I explained biggest fear is they will be kicked out, both have a bag packed ready to leave if they get kicked out. We talked and they will stay with me if that happens. I'm nervous honestly not for me or what I will say but whether or not they're really ready for the possible fallout. I wish they would let me prepare them a little more but they feel ready. So wish us luck."
Bisexual,wonderfullslut,ainbow, 
My boyfriend wants to have sex with someone else. Help!,Sea_Fox5093,ainbow,"Hello Everyone! I wanted to come on here and ask for advice because I know this is fairly common in the gay community and I need the logic and reassurance. 

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for 9 months and I'm obviously hoping for the long term with him. One thing we have talked about a lot is having threesomes. My boyfriend says that he wants to have sex with others because he just has the desire. We are both young so he wants to have fun while he still can. He says that if he doesn't because I'm uncomfortable with it for whatever reason, he may have resentment towards me because of this. But I'm okay with threesomes as long as we both have fun.  The tricky part comes with wanting to have sex with another person, without me present. 

We started off our relationship being pretty kinky and bought a lot of toys. Recently, however, we haven't used any because he does not feel comfortable with me dominating him. He says that it would interfere with our love life and that it wouldn't be good. (Personally, I'm okay with it, but I obviously want to respect his feelings.) He explained that he wants to have a separate person that he can go to who will dominate him and someone he can have sex with. He says that this would be while we are married which would be in about 5 years or less probably. This also implies that I can have a sub that I have sex with, although I don't want this. And so, this makes me so uncomfortable. 

The thought of him having sex with someone else without me, especially with someone dominating him roughly, hurts me. It kinda feels like a punch in the gut. I struggle with anxiety and this topic is one of the things that spike it the most. I'm scared that if I can't agree to this then he will eventually resent me and want to break up later.

I have told him that I'm uncomfortable and he respects that. But like I said before, he's scared he will have resentment. We are both holding out hope that I will warm up to the idea eventually. I'd love to hear advice from anyone else related to this! Have you experienced anything similar with your Significant Other? Does anyone else struggle with their partner wanting to have independent sex? I know other people do this so I'd love to hear why they feel good about it and how they still maintain a healthy sex life with their partner. Anything will help. Thank you all!"

Update,bi_dad48,ainbow,OMG the past 24 + hours have been amazing. I told you this morning about my daughter coming out as bi to me yesterday. We talked I let her ask questions I answered them etc.  It was such a bonding experience. Well apparently she's told a bunch of people including her cousins cause when I got home this afternoon one of my nieces and one of my nephew's was there waiting on me. My niece came out as lesbian nephew as bi. Just like i did with my daughter we talked they asked questions etc.  Now my brother died 19 years ago this is one of his sons and the niece is actually from the guy my sister in law remarried to so not technically my niece but I don't care. My brother would have been as understanding as I am. However my sister in law and her husband are huge homophobes. They can't stand me. I don't know if my niece and nephew will come out to them but if they do I suspect I'll have 2 more kids living with me. As always my DM'S are open

How to embrace your feminine side as a gay man after coming out?,mynameisnotbecky1,ainbow,"Ive been out for about 4 and a half months, but Ive been struggling w embracing myself. Ive always been a bit of a queen. I spent sm time dictating my every move, walk, action etc. now Im becoming a bit more at ease w it. But Im not fully comfortable and very much nervous. The progress is not enough! 

To anyone who has worked on embracing their own gender defying ways, how did you learn to stop caring. The BIGGEST fear is people looking at me like I switched up. When in actuality I just wanna be me first and foremost. 

Ig what I want to know is how to stop giving a f*ck what others think. And being afraid of rejection from your peers."

Really struggling with my sexuality..,ItsMeKYCO,ainbow,"I am female and I have known I was attracted to women by age 14, I'm 26 now. I've always identified as bisexual even though I had, and still pretty much have not had a real girlfriend.

In the last 2 years I've experienced some pretty severe sexual trauma at the hands of men. I used to have a very high sex drive, and it's pretty much completely gone. Not only this, but I find myself being more and more disgusted by men while being more and more attracted to women (thanks TikTok).

For instance there is a video that says ""name something you would eat every single day and not get bored of."" When women imply *puthay* I am incredibly hot and bothered. But when men make the same joke I find myself uncomfortable and grossed out.

I'm just really struggling if I am having these ""symptoms"" because I'm really a lesbian that was raised in a heteronormative society and is just now realizing she never really was attracted to men in the first place? Because masculine features on both men and women still grab my attention... but not necessarily the men anymore...

Or is this just because I have experienced sexual trauma and overall realized how troubling the patriarchy is...."

Gay people only earned the right to marry nationwide this decade and even more recently adoption rights. This happened literally within my lifetime and I have memories of me hearing about this for the first time but in conversation with LGBT people or just people my age/younger we talk about it like it was a long time ago and this strikes me as odd. 

Are people my age just not as aware of how recent of a development this is? I feel like young queer people are losing a grasp of LGBT history/struggle

Proud dad,bi_dad48,ainbow,My youngest daughter just came out to me as bi. It was such a sweet moment. She said she had been feeling this way for awhile but with her mom being so homophobic she never acted on it. Since she's been living with me she's had the opportunity to become her own individual and try things her mom wouldn't let her do. We had a talk about her feelings as well as the possibility of being bullied. She's a strong girl mentally and emotionally so I believe she'll be fine.

He does a lot of masculine things like watching sports, liking cars, going fishing and hiking, but at the same time hes also kinda effeminate. His only relationship didnt last very long and I feel like some girls kind of view him as a gay friend. I dont think he wants to be seen as gay though, we both live in a homophobic environment and he lives in a christian family. He acts weird and awkward around homophobic people but will join in on the jokes to fit in. Its confusing bc he definitely isnt homophobic, he listens to some VERY gay shit like Frank Ocean and Tyler the creator (he literally thinks igor is a 10/10 one of the best albums oat ). Obviously this doesnt determine his sexuality or anything, he could be straight and enjoy the music the same way. He also makes gay jokes around me and will kind of flirt with me sometimes, but I think he does that with everyone so that doesnt really mean anything tbh. I barely see him because of online school and I havent even come out to him yet because I really dont want to risk ruining our friendship and make him act different around me or something. What should I do? Am i just infatuated and should I lay off?"

How to deal with homophobic family and friends,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Whether your have come out or are planning on coming out to your family and friends you need a plan. If you know your family and friends are supportive this will be easier for you. Its still scary revealing this but you will have support. For those with homophobic family and friends here's some advice its not comprehensive by any means but hopefully it helps you 

1. Working to Change Their Views

Hear them out. This is going to be hard because you are already opposed to their reasons but listen any way without interrupting. Remember you can't change their views if you don't understand where it comes from. 

Ask questions.  Find out why they believe its wrong. Again you're trying to find out what shapes their belief. 

Respect your parents religious views. A lot of times this is the main reason for homophobia. Even if its wrong. You can't however disregard their religion its important to them. You have to work on showing them why its been taught wrong. Patience is the key. 

Give your parents a different perspective.  Present them with alternate views as to why you feel the way you do. 

Dont give up on your parents.  They still love you they just don't understand you hmm that's always the same problem every generation guess Will Smith was right ""Parents just don't understand""  

Coming Out to Your Parents

Decide whether coming out is a good idea.  Only you know if you can safely do so

Find a good time to come out.  Find a time your parents are relaxed and in a decent mood. It might make them more willing to listen. Side note there are no tricks or funny ways that works. Be upfront and honest

Be kind and compassionate.  This is key. Its going to be hard to not get defensive but remember in their minds they're protecting you a parents number one job. 

Allow them their reactions and responses.  Their feelings are valid to let them process this

Know when youve said enough.  Honestly that speaks for itself. 

Give your parents time.  Again big news is hard to process don't rush them

Emphasize that youre still the same person.  Very important let them know you haven't changed your still the same person they love. 

Consider counseling.  Family counseling can give you a professional advocate to help you navigate this together

Standing Up for Yourself

Realize that your life is yours alone.  Ultimately if they accept you or not its still who you are fight for yourself you've earned it

Make it clear that you arent asking for permission.  Be firm but polite let them know your telling them your gay for example not asking if its ok to be gay. 

Have a backup plan.  This is important there is always a chance they could react horribly and throw you out. You need a friends house to stay at or supportive family member just in case. Trust me you don't want to be homeless."

I developed a mental health related app to be mindful of your actions!,Dragonair_fruit1371,ainbow,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I was having social anxiety and I was isolating myself, sometimes even from my kids and family. I really didnt know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

Mates! Comrades! Fellow LGBT+ folks and Allies gather around I got another story time,ghostofHamilton9488,ainbow,"So, I decided to go to online chat rooms--just to connect with LGBT+ people. The rules I had for my safety were these

1. Talk not to males (unless they initiate conversation--I question guy's motivations--I've had guy friends but the relationships never last long and honestly only like 5 guys have actually held an intelligent conversation with me. Many were creepy. A couple were gatekeepers.)
2. Skip AND WARN MINORS OFF THE SITE (I've seen so much shit--blood boiling)
3. Only really engage with folks 20-26 any older or 18 and 19 year olds I either skipped or trolled (to which they'd skip because I angered them THOUGH I will say I found a couple Redditors which warms my heart)
4. Engage with women and LGBT
5. Use an alias to protect myself--I do not divulge in any personal information unless I feel 100% safe

With these rules in mind, I jumped headfirst into online chatrooms. Found a couple folks that I'm in contact with--loose acquaintances. Nothing more nothing less. However, I met an Aussie and a Brit. The Aussie is something else. To the Aussies on this site, you guys are so fucking cool. You guys are awesome. A tough breed of humanity that I accept and adore. She's a flirt. A great person to talk to. The Brit? Oh boy the Brit. 

As an American, I don't have hate in my heart. How could I? Normally when I say I'm from the US I'm immediately skipped and that hurts a bit. Stings, but I shake it off. Now, the Brit is full on probably the most loveable based woman I ever met. She respected my request to stay anonymous. She respected and accepted me as an asexual. I laid out my boundaries--told her what's acceptable but the conversations aren't sexual--like at all. We bonded almost immediately. She was there for one thing. I was there to meet people. To have a good time. Lads, lassies and folks in between, the Brit is funny. Caring. A true Queen. LGBT+ to boot. We have very similar views. Very similar people AND the kicker? 

Same age! 

Both 21. Both LGBT+. Both progressive (though I hesitate to label myself I'm more of an open-minded kind centrist like I just want to hang out and chat). Both feminists (again I don't like to label myself as a feminist due to how its viewed by the populace). The greatest conversation we had was not only over simping (we simped YES and I was all for it actually when I brought up Ruby Rose--not straight at all. We joked. We clowned around. We basically vibed like the vibing cat meme--super similar viewpoints. Both romantics. Both vicious and warrior queens when it comes to protecting the innocent. 

I've always wanted penpals. I've always wanted to connect with people around the world. Thought I'd share. Spread a little happiness."

Why is there a lack of queer support for adults?,dashing-rainbows,ainbow,There is such a strong focus on queer youth... but a lack of support for queer adults. There just seems like a lack of resources for queer adults in communities. It feels often like once you are an adult that everything gets cut off and you are shoved off on your own and it is very isolating. Especially for queer adults out of their 20's as even college groups are very young adult centric and it feels alone there. Anyone else notice this?

UAE will be hosting the International Conference on Gender Identity and LGBT Rights,CamilTahan,ainbow,"What a milestone to know that the UAE will be hosting the International Conference on Gender Identity and LGBT Rights. This doesn't come as a surprise as the new UAE laws that guarantee that all members of society get their rights and personal freedom.

The new UAE laws guarantee that all members of society get their rights and personal freedom, as the UAE includes hundreds of nationalities from different cultures and religions.

Back in November, the UAE mandated several legal reforms, including decriminalizing drinking or possessing alcohol and attempted suicide, allowing unmarried couples to cohabitate, and no longer allowing men to benefit from lighter sentences for assaulting a female relative in so-called honor crimes.

The announced reforms would alsoallow couples who married outside the UAE to follow the laws of their home country or the country in which they married in matters of divorce and inheritance.The United Arab Emirates also had a major overhaul of the countrys Islamic personal laws, allowing unmarried couples to cohabitate, loosening alcohol restrictions and criminalizing so-called honor killings.

The broadening of personal freedoms reflects how UAE continues to progress positively as a nation  well accommodating for citizens as well as, expats, tourists, fortune-seekers and businesses.The reforms aim to boost the countrys economic and social standing and consolidate the UAEs principles of tolerance,.

The move follows a historic U.S.-brokered deal to normalize relations between the UAE and Israel, which is expected to bring an influx of Israeli tourists and investment.

The changes will also reflect the efforts of the Emirates rulers to keep pace with a rapidly changing society at home.

Guys. Guys! Thought I'd share,ghostofHamilton9488,ainbow,"I've been going through a lot mentally. Just suffering from anxiety a lot. However, I am getting better. I have good days and bad days. Today, I had a conversation with my mom. The first one I had since coming out to her as asexual. I didn't tell her why I wanted the black ring--I told her about the asexual flag. But today--today on this fine May day--she made me cry. 

She fully accepts me. Told me that with everything going on certain words still get to me. That with everything going on in the world I'm 100% still coming to terms with it. I've accepted myself and I do have bad days anxiety wise. However, she told me during a phone call (she had to work) that she 100% supports me. That she loves me no matter what. That my being ace does not in any way shape or form change her perception of me (oh look I can't see the screen). That I am valid--that she accepts me and loves me or me and not my orientation. That I'm still her daughter no matter what. I broke down. I was an ally before I came out myself--I'm still coming to terms with it. I've actually joined these subs to build myself up. As I was silently sobbing--all I could repeat was 'thank you'. In my head, I was going 'I'm valid. I'm valid. I'm FUCKING VALID'! She also told me that she admires how much strength that it took for me to come out to her. To her, sexual orientation and gender identity has been a non-issue in the sense that it has no bearing on a person's personality. When I came out to her (via email) she immediately texted me. Told me she's proud of me. At the time, I didn't burst into tears. At the time, I didn't quite grasp how unbelievably necessary it is to feel valid. To be accepted. That was another thing echoing in my head today. My mom accepts me. My friends accept me. You guys accept me. 

I love you all. Wherever you are in your journey--married, single, confused, closeted or out, know you are valid. I just thought I would share a happy story to brighten up people's days."

Love,bi_dad48,ainbow,I heard a parent today talking to a another parent about the fact his 14 year old daughter just came out as lesbian. He was very supportive and understanding but was clueless as to what she needed. I got to thinking about that and what I would have wanted as a teen when I came out and the answer was simply love. I had not changed my personality I had not changed my habits the only thing that changed was that I was bisexual. The love I had before I came out was all I wanted after I came out. I didn't care if you understood right then everything being bisexual meant hell we could have learned together instead you viewed me as trash and threw me out. I know a lot of you have similar stories and it believe if a parent would just realize its still your child the love doesn't or shouldn't change when we come out. I doubt many parents will see this but in case they do and want to know how to support their child just love them the rest will come. My DM'S are open if you need someone to love you like a parent should im here for you.

PRIDE ( Proud Resilient Individual Demanding Equality),bi_dad48,ainbow,"P - proud. Be proud of who you are even if you can't come out. That in no way diminishes your gender or sexuality. Be proud inside until you can safely be proud on the outside. Of you have friends who know be proud around them never feel shame or unnatural about who you are you were born that way

R - resilient. Be resilient in the fight. Don't give up even if you feel like no one cares. We in the community care and we're fighting with you. If someone refuses to use your pronouns or correct gender keep reminding them. If someone tries to invalidate LGBTQ correct them. Keep in keeping on until we win

I - individual.  You are unique there's no one else exactly like you. Your sexuality and gender are part of that uniqueness. It is as real and genuine as your eye color. Don't let anyone convince you its not. This is not a phase or a way to be cool its who you are and dammit that's special.
 
D - demanding.  You have to demand your rights cause honey after my 48 years on this earth you can't expect the government to just give them to you even if its right. You get to demand to be heard demand to be seen demand the respect you deserve and keep demanding until they listen. 

E - equality. This is what its comes down to the one thing we've been fighting for for years. We just want to be treated equally. We want medical care like everyone else. We want to raise kids like everyone else. We want to be married with the same spousal rights as ever other hetero couple in other words we want to be treated like human beings not some mistake from God that doesn't even deserve to live."

**You:** You are really not a community member then

**You:** There is intolerance in your heart

**Stranger:** The lgbt community isnt some all inclusive club for every sexual minority. Its an exclusive community for people who are same gender attracted and for people with gender dysphoria. Aka homosexuals, bisexuals, and trans people

**Stranger:** Sorry I dont tolerate lgbt-phobia as a homosexual trans male &lt;3

**You:** But by excluding people like asexuals (who make up 5 percent of the population) you are being exclusive

**Stranger:** Queer is a slur. Questioning doesnt make you lgbt. Demisexual is just being normal its not a sexuality. Nb is and always has been trans. Intersex, asexual, aromantic, and polyamorous people are valid but they arent lgbt

**Stranger:** Thats the point sweetie

**Stranger:** The lgbt community isnt for asexuals. That doesnt make them any less or valid though

**You:** As an asexual I disagree with you

**You:** We are a minority

**Stranger:** You arent lgbt so your opinion doesnt matter

**Stranger:** I know that. But that doesnt make you lgbt

**You:** Actually I'm a closeted les

**You:** I disagree with you

**Stranger:** The lgbt community is an exclusive community for people who are same gender attracted and for people with gender dysphoria

**You:** I disagree with you

**Stranger:** Asexual is valid but it has nothing to do with same gender attraction or your gender identity not matching your sex

**Stranger:** Youre being lgbt-phobic then

**Stranger:** Being inclusive is harmful Dude

**You:** I think being exclusive is more harmful

**You:** Modulate the key rather than debate with me

**Stranger:** The entire foundation of what it means to be lgbt is that youre either same gender attracted or your gender identity doesnt match your biological/birth sex

**You:** That's an ignorant stance you have

**Stranger:** The point of the lgbt community is that its exclusive

**You:** It should be inclusive

**Stranger:** Its not though. Its called respecting lgbt history

**Stranger:** It shouldnt lol

**Stranger:** Its not for everyone

**You:** Explain the updated flags then

**Stranger:** Its only for homosexuals, bisexuals, and trans people

**Stranger:** Pedophiles have a flag but does that make them lgbt?

**Stranger:** Like dude just because something had a flag doesnt make it lgbt

**You:** I don't exist. I am invalid to you and you are not really fighting for equality. Pedophiles are not and will never be LGBT. They are commiting crimes

**Stranger:** I never said that lol

**You:** Good to know.

**You:** GRSM community mate

**Stranger:** Lgbt people fight for equality for homosexuals, bisexuals, and trans people

**Stranger:** Its not boo

**Stranger:** Its the lgbt community

**You:** Gender Romantic Sexual Minority Community

**Stranger:** Asexuals are real and valid but that doesnt make them lgbt

**You:** You are aphobic

**Stranger:** Asexual has nothing to do with sexuality so by your logic its not lgbt

**You:** Sexuality is who you are attracted to

**Stranger:** Where am I being against asexual?

**Stranger:** Sexuality is about the gender/s that youre attracted to actually

**Stranger:** Asexual is the lack of sexual attraction. By definition its not a sexuality

**You:** Human sexuality is the way people experience and express themselves sexually. This involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors. Because it is a broad term, which has varied with historical contexts over time, it lacks a precise definitio

**Stranger:** By your logic of GRSM its not apart of that anyways

**Stranger:** Sexuality and sexual orientation are about the gender/s that youre attracted to

**You:** This is the DICTIONARY definition

**You:** You mate are wrong

**Stranger:** I dont really care about the dictionary definition considering you think cis het sexual minorities can be lgbt lol

**You:** You should

**Stranger:** Sexuality is about the gender/s that youre attracted to

**Stranger:** Why would I care what some lgbt-phobic cissy thinks?

**Stranger:** Care about\*

**You:** I am in no way LGBT phobic

**Stranger:** You are sweetie

**Stranger:** You think cis hets can be lgbt

**You:** Dude I never said that

**You:** This argument is going nowhere

**Stranger:** Being inclusive is lgbt-phobic

**You:** I can't change your mind and that's fine

**You:** Unbelievable

**Stranger:** You think asexuals can be lgbt when asexual has nothing to do with same gender attracted or being trans

**Stranger:** Asexuals arent lgbt for being asexual dude

**Stranger:** Someone can be lgbt AND asexual

**You:** What about pansexuals? They're attracted to all genders

**Stranger:** Just because asexual isnt lgbt doesnt make it any less real or valid dude

**Stranger:** Pansexual is both a biphobic and transphobic label

**Stranger:** Theres only 2 genders. Being attracted to both genders is bisexuality.

**Stranger:** Here read this and educate yourself dude

**Stranger:** Pansexuals modern definition was created with the transphobic ideology that trans was a separate or third gender/sex and therefore not included in bisexuality. Which is also biphobic because its limiting bisexuality. Nb is and always has been trans. Its the lack of a gender, not a third gender. Trans men are men and trans women are women. Trans people have always been included in bisexuality. Excluding trans people from bisexuality is both transphobic and biphobic. And heres pansexuals transphobic history. The farthest dated back mentions of pansexual on the internet, PRETTYPINKMANA, June 13th, 2002, 08:24 pm. Welcome! XD Welcome to the community! Obviously, no one has posted yet since I just opened it but I wanted to be the first to open the floor. Anyway, this community is for pansexuals, as described in the userinfo. Pansexuals love people of all genders, male and female, but unlike bisexuals, pansexuals love transgendered, androgynous and gender fluid people, people who dont fit into the categories of male or female. People such as J-Rockers, like the two men on the community icon. Pansexuals come in all shapes and sizes, all sharing one common goal, sexual freedom. https://i-am-pansexual.livejournal.com/2002/06/13/

**Stranger:** If youre attracted to someone regardless of gender, attracted to everyone (cis and trans), or attracted to a person or personality and not gender then youre just bisexual dude. Thats always been bisexuality throughout lgbt history and youre erasing decades of lgbt history dude. Sexuality is about the gender/s that youre attracted to. Not about your preferences or how youre attracted to people Heres some basic bisexual history that pansexual store and is erasing. A quote from the bisexual manifesto, Bisexuality is a whole, fluid identity. Do not assume that bisexuality is binary or duogamous in nature: that we have ""two"" sides or that we must be involved simultaneously with both genders to be fulfilled human beings. Another quote from Bi.org (date unknown)  Bisexuality is not limited by sex nor, by extension, gender. Imposing gender limitations upon bisexuality is, in itself, a form of bi erasure.  Bisexuality is an orientation for which sex and gender are not a boundary to attraction. A quote from GLSEN, Out Of The Past guidebook, 1998. Bisexual - being emotionally and physically attracted to all genders. A quote from BGSU.edu, 2003. Bisexual: A person who is attracted to people regardless of gender (a person does not have to be in a relationship to be bisexual!) A quote from Lani Kaahumanu, The Bisexual Community: Are We Visible Yet? 1987.  I am bisexual because I am drawn to particular people regardless of gender. A quote from a bisexuals survey responses in Closer to Home: Bisexuality and Feminism, Weise, 1992. Bisexuals fall in love with a person, not a gender.

**Stranger:** Erasing bisexuality and supporting a transphobic label isnt it sweetie

**You:** You are citing outdated information

**You:** Stonewall

**Stranger:** Its not outdated its bisexual history and the modern existence of pansexual

**You:** Yes history--past

**Stranger:** Stop erasing bisexuality &lt;3

**You:** We live in 2021

**You:** I'm not

**Stranger:** Its still being attracted to both genders sweetie

**Stranger:** Theres still only 2 genders

**You:** You are condescending

**You:** YOU are transphobic

**Stranger:** Trans isnt a third gender. Nb is trans. Its the lack of a gender

**Stranger:** Youre cis please stfu and listen

**Stranger:** Made up genders identities arent valid or real. They're just transphobic"

Just had my first gay encounter. Now what?,joy-bliss389,ainbow,"

Facts, for the curious - 27 year old (straight identified) single male, craigslist hookup, mutual oral. I swallowed! 

I've been curious for a while now, been propositioned before, finally got really horny and found someone on craigslist. In a way, I'm pretty proud of myself! Evidently I'm a natural, and I even swallowed without any trouble. A bit of an upset stomach though, but what's bothering me more is what this means as far as my identity goes.

Sure I could just say ""nothing"" and move on, this was just a one-time thing, I'm still straight. But I have a feeling I might do this again - and considering my friends, family and coworkers, I might even be comfortable having a boyfriend maybe.

I get that there're already labels for that - bicurious to bisexual - but is there a term for straight, and not attracted to men, but a big fan of cock?

Maybe I'm just glowing a bit. This was a big personal step for me, and I think I just wanted to share :P

EDIT: Thanks for the replies folks! Looks like ""bisexual and heteroromantic"" or ""heteroflexible"" are both working and accurate terms."

Connecting via Chat rooms *so wholesome*,ghostofHamilton9488,ainbow,"Born in '99 I've always been fascinated by how people connected in the '90s and '00s. I know how dangerous chat rooms are--not using them until 21. I have always had a strong interest in connecting with people in the community. Get to know people. I've only been out for a couple months. The wholesomeness--just infectious. I feel home and I've never felt that in any other community outside of YouTube channels. 

In going to chat rooms, I'm extremely cautious. Very anxious--the pandemic has affected my mental health in ways that it shouldn't have. I'm a social person--I need human interaction. My guard never drops. I skip those who are younger than me--or I'll warn them. I filter to get LGBT+ folks. The conversations are always not asexual friendly so I skip. However, I've met four people--one Aussie, one Italian, and two Americans. All female. All in the community. All accepting that I'm asexual. In fact, one of the Americans, so nice. So understanding of my boundaries. It's so wholesome. I love the community."

Coming out what you should know,bi_dad48,ainbow,Ok so not uncommon there's a lot of post about how to come out to friends or parents or other loved ones. So hopefully I can answer some of that for you tonight. First understand you are under no requirement to come out. There's no rule or anything that says you have to come out. Coming out is a personal decision. You never have to tell anyone or you can tell any and everyone if you want. If you choose to come out consider a few things. First of you still love at home be prepared in case your asked to leave. You need to be able to make it on your own. Also if you're not asked to leave be prepared for constant fights over your sexuality and gender. Second I hate to bust your balloon but there is no easy way to come out. There's no tricks or cute fun ways to do it the best way is too talk to people especially your parents up front and honestly. Be ready to explain why your the sexuality and gender you are have information to back it up let them see its not something you take lightly. If you have deeply religious parents and family its unlikely they will change their views so consider carefully before approaching them.  Older people and those with higher education will have issues with pronouns because it seems illogical to them best to just skip that fight. Now personally I will say I came out at 14 and was kicked out and if would go through it all again. I had to be able to live my life in my terms. Yes it was hard but the most rewarding things usually are. If you feel like coming out is something you just have to do then go for it. Shout it from the roof tops and I will be here to support you all the way. Likewise if you feel it best to be quiet I will be here when you need to talk and vent and let out all your anger and frustration. My DM'S are always open.

The joy of validation,bi_dad48,ainbow,I had the greatest thrill today! I met a nonbinary person and the look on their face when I called them by their proper pronouns without having to even be asked or told was amazing. I wish you could have seen the look in their eye The Joy they had of being affirmed and validated for who they are. Their mother on the other hand was standing there and chastise me for not calling them a boy. I tried to explain to her that not everybody is born the gender they are assigned at Birth and they were simply trying to express themselves for who they felt like they were she said I can't believe that you accept that nonsense. When I explained to her that I was bisexual and part of the lgbtq community and that for me not to accept it would be hypocritical she laughed. It is people like that that make our journey the hardest people who choose to remain close-minded and not listen to the truth. But the look on their face when they were validated and they were affirmed was all the thanks I needed I knew I had done what needed to be done. That is why I want to be in your corner that is why I want to stand up with you that is why I want to be there when you're struggling and need a shoulder to cry on or need someone to talk to that is why I am here. We must stop arguing amongst ourselves and backbiting and gossiping and name-calling other members of the community we all Belong Together and if we don't start standing together then we will never be the strong Community I know we can be. My DM'S are open if you want to talk.

Just a thought,bi_dad48,ainbow,It hurts to see posts from people who can't be them true selves. Whether its from living with homophobic parents to being in a country where its still illegal. Everyone needs an opportunity to express themselves. Its so frustrating for example to be a femboy but never dress feminine. I wish I had the means to start a club or rec center or something where you could come an be yourself a little while each day or so until you can be free to do it on your own. Whether your trans and want to dress the real you or your non binary and want to try looking more neutral or your gay or bi or lesbian or whatever and you want to see what its like to be open about it we all need that freedom. I think if there's a place where you could go and do that it would take off some of the pressure of feeling like your trapped and maybe would cut down on depression and suicide in the community.

My life in a nutshell,JamieGollehon,ainbow,"I had a stroke Tuesday before Xmas. I am far from well. My surgery could have been prevented due to the stress i endured from 2003 had 9 inches of intestine twist lose blood flow and die inside me. Though i was having a appendicitis it was worse they took 1/3 of my large intestine in a bowel resectioning. Died twice in a 20 hour surgery then a month of medically induced coma. No one came to see me. I could die and be the nameless. My life has been a living hell had 15+ rapes happen. Years upon years upon years of living on the streets. Fought off a rapist got 2.5 months in jail. Yeah one glorious day by day by day hundreds of days living outside not able to bathe for months on end. Living by the Sacramento river to cliffs variety or where Harvey Milks photo shop was. Left for fucking dead. Dad died in 2005 shortly thereafter my mother dissowned me. So i have zero family. Zero.
Nothing nada. Nobody. So yeah. The blame game is here i had a good life. Then it was robbed from me. I never had the tools to survive i was the forgotten the spat on.
Two times i was sleeping on a park bench and two separate times woke up to a hand down my pants i was fucking asleep given a unwanted hand job. I am 1/4 the person i was. Completely disowned destroyed and living a walking death.

Proud mama,Illseemyselfout-,ainbow,"My 11 year old daughter wrote me an amazing letter last night telling me that shes bisexual. She even made a bisexual pride flag and hung it on her wall to encourage herself to be herself. Im so glad that I have made it clear to her through the years that everyone is worthy of love, regardless of gender, skin color, orientation whatever. Im so grateful that she felt safe in telling me. As soon as I found the letter, I went and hugged her and she cried and cried and I just told her that I was so proud of her for being so brave to be herself. 

I want to honor her courage to be herself. For those who have come out to parents, is there anything you would have loved or needed? 

Also, Im feeling sad. Not because shes bi but because the world is so cruel. It breaks my heart to know that she will experience prejudice and shame and bigotry that her straight friends just wont have to deal with. Im feeling very protective of her and enraged at the way weve treated lgbtqia+.

And if that cruelty, prejudice and shame came from your parents, then *Im your proud mama now*. I love you just the way you are and you are worthy of that love."

Who's your allie,bi_dad48,ainbow,We all need an allie. Somebody we know who will support us and stand by us no matter what. For most people its family however a lot of LGBTQ people have their family shun them or they're so homophobic they're to scared to come out. In that situation they have lost what should have been their greatest allie. You need to know you have someone to talk to when you've been bullied at school or out in public.  You need someone who can lift your spirits when its been a rough day. You need someone who will encourage you when you're ready to come out. You need someone to fight with you when you've been wronged. Young or old it doesn't matter we all need an allie. If you need an allie and have no one then you can count on me. I would be proud to stand with you on this journey thru the good and the bad. So if you need me my DM'S are open.

Coming out brings changes,bi_dad48,ainbow,Some of you like me have already come out some have not. For those of you that have not I want to prepare you. When I was younger and discovered I was bi no one could tell me what would happen when I came out because a lot of people were still in the closet. I was not prepared for the drama and loss that went down. I assumed became my parents loved me nothing would change but I was wrong for me everything changed. I wish I would have had the knowledge I'm about to share with you. There will be changes when you come out both positive and negative. You may experience some or none of these but its better to be prepared so your not surprised. First the negative changes and keep in mind this is not a complete list just a lot of common changes. First you need to be prepared to lose people such as family and friends there is a chance you won't but a greater chance you will. Parents especially have a hard time finding out their child is not what they thought and some are influenced by church and politics. This is negative because it hurts to lose close people but if they're toxic they need to go. Second you may be bullied or made fun of kids especially because other kids love to tease those who are different. You cannot rely on your parents or teachers to handle it so find a way to cope and get through. Third you may be kicked out so be prepared with somewhere to go. Its a harsh reality but a lot of LGBTQ youth are homeless. Fourth you will get frustrated telling people your pronouns your new name again your preferred gender and sexuality over and over again. Be persistent though its the only way to get them to do it.  Fifth hearing homophobic comments and jokes will drive you crazy only you though can decide if you remain silent or speak up. Again those are some of the worst that you might experience so be prepared. Now the positive. First you get to be the real you now more hiding in the closet. You can now express yourself whether that's how you dress or wearing makeup and( yes even guys can wear makeup) to what your called your new name pronouns etc.. Second its going to feel like a millstone has been removed from your neck. No more carrying the secrets weighing you down. Third you can finally date and pursue who you want but please if its getting sexual use protection. Fourth you can do things like beginning to transition or take hormone blockers to give you more time. Coming out is a personal decision and you need the facts in order to make it. I know a lot more could be added but I don't like super long posts so feel free to message me if you want to talk more.

Equality is a special right,bi_dad48,ainbow,"Equality should not have to be a special right. In America part of our constitution says in the Bill of Rights you have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If the pursuit of my happiness is to be bisexual why should I have to fight for that right. If your happiness is to be lesbian gay trans or anything else why should you have to fight for that right. Yes I know we have to fight for certain things like marriage but Society should not be able to determine what my happiness looks like. So what if my happiness is different than yours that's what makes us unique. I know in other countries you don't have the same Constitution and laws that we have in America and you may legitimately have to fight for your rights and I hope one day that will change for you. You know it's funny everybody always wants to say we're created equal even in the Bible and other religions, but equal is always defined by what they consider normal and anybody that falls out of that normal range no longer has the same rights it's time we in the community stand up and claim our rights that were already given to us. Kids should not have to hide in the closet because they fear who they are and how their parents will react yet it's a sad reality most of them face if we can get our rights that are already hours then our kids and their kids and the kids that follow won't have to cower in the closet any longer.

"I wanted a bi flag watch band as a sort of subtle way to come out. After being unable to find one, I started making them - and now, after almost two years, I've expanded and made my own website!",88slides,ainbow,"This is a mod-approved post. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to show off the evolution of my watch band project, [pridebands.us](https://pridebands.us). It started out as a single run of bi pride watch bands on eBay, but they've been fairly popular - they're in eight countries and their sale has generated almost $350 (40% of each sale) for the Trevor Project. I've really appreciated the opportunity to make something that was helpful to me that other people have enjoyed, while also being able to give to the community rather than simply profit from it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently decided to branch out into some other pride color designs as well as some additional sizes. I'll be moving on to make some trans flag bands this fall, in a handful of sizes.

&amp;#x200B;

Getting word of mouth out is challenging for such a niche market - lgbt+ watch enthusiasts - so I could use your help here. I'd really like to make this website a welcoming space for people new to watches as well as a place to get some everyday pride gear.

"What are the arguments against ""only men and women can complement each other""?",AffectionateCorner57,ainbow,"Sexual complementarity is often used as an argument against gay relationships (by homophobes).

According to it, the bodies, and roles of men and women show compatibility between men and women as a whole, and that only different people (that is, only men and women) are capable of the type of compatibility aka complementarity required to be in a relationship of sexual love and fidelity.

""Sexual complementarity"" claims that the bodies of men and women are like lock and key, completing each other, that it just ""doesnt work"" to have two women or two men in a relationship, and that is is impossible for there to be a relationship of sexual love and fidelity between two men or two women because bodies and roles of two men can not complete and complement each other, and the bodies and roles of two women can not complete and complement each other. Think here of trying to cut meat with a spoon, eat soup with a fork, or get a key to go inside another key, and a lock inside another lock. ""Sexual complementarity"" claims a relationship between two men or two women, is both not really possible (just like cutting meat with a spoon, eating soup with a fork, and trying to get a key go inside another key, and a lock inside another lock are not possible) and not really able to contribute to the ""flourishing"" either of individuals or of society.

Celebrate if you had the courage to get up today to keep the fight going.  These are just a few examples but celebrate whatever victories you have.

Hi,

So first of all I really want to apologise for using the term Queer as a cishet person but I literally cant think of another word to use. If anyone has a better word for what Im feeling please share  

Im a cisgender, heterosexual ish woman aged 20. I say ish because I am attracted to some non binary people but Im only attracted to male genitalia. 

I have never felt I fitted in anywhere with the heterosexual community. I am polyamorous and have known this since I was about 4 (I remember being a child and not understanding the concept of being limited to one partner.) The heterosexual community arent very understanding about polyamory and I find that non cishet people are kinder towards me. Im also a sex worker, and find the same thing regarding this. Finally, Im neurodivergent, and again I feel that non cishet people are more understanding and kind towards this.

I dont feel I relate to the cishet community whatsoever, but Im worried about infringing on spaces where I dont belong. I feel different but I dont know how to define it and I feel lonely"

No need to remain uneducated,bi_dad48,ainbow,"I know a lot of you have this similar situation or had it in the past where a parent or both parents are homophobic or maybe other family members or even friends are. I have seen posts asking how to tell them what you mean when you non binary for instance or aromantic etc...input your gender or sexuality here lol. They expect you to educate them and if you want to you can that is up to you, however its not your job to educate your parents. Parents are smart enough to know there should be resources available to help them understand what you just told them. There's research and history showing even at a young age you can know.  Then they in turn can educate younger siblings or other family members. You may tell your friends to google resources for LGBTQ youth there are tons of educational sites to help them understand. No one should be ignorant on LGBTQ rights and lifestyle the information is there even for yourself so can tell them you have made an informed decision without influence from friends or social media. In my opinion a parent who chooses to remain ignorant is basically telling their child this part of your life isn't important to me. My DMs as always remain open."

Struggles,bi_dad48,ainbow,We all have struggles in your lives.  Kids struggle with did I pass the test or being sick doing homework or chores and oh yeah puberty where everything changes. Adults struggle with paying bills fixing the house the car or any number of things. That's stuff everyone on the planet faces regularly but what if that person is LGBTQ. Kids now not only have regular problems but now they have to deal with hate and being bullied and what's my label am I safe to come out or will I be disowned am I the right gender and the list goes on. Its sad kids thought puberty was rough but add in LGBTQ problems to it its really tough. Adults aren't immune. I wish I could say things had gotten better in the 36 years I've been dealing with it but it hasn't. Kids and adults today still have  them same struggles. That's why if I can help you where others can't im here. You never need permission to DM me its always granted.

Except I change the wording a bit.

Do you have arguments against that?"
We must do better (trigger warning),bi_dad48,ainbow,I cried for hours last night after reading a story from a girl whose brother committed suicide because he was bisexual and the country they live in would have killed him if they had found out. Truth is though even in countries where you're not put to death children and even some adults struggle so hard to be who they are and when their families turn their backs on them or don't accept them they spiral until they feel its there only choice. Then we throw on top of that they ones who are kicked out and left homeless who are forced to steal or other things to survive yet countries like America claim to be supportive. We as a community world wide must come together and stop fighting about what groups are and aren't a part of LGBTQ and move the fight to where it belongs. We need to lobby for equal rights and treatment more than ever. We need programs where kids and teens and parents can be educated. When need more homes and shelters for kids and teens when they're kicked out and have no where to go. Its not going to change overnight and I know there's a lot more to add to that list but none of it can get done if we're arguing over if bisexual and pansexual is the same or any other silly debate amongst ourselves we must do better. Its ok to pm me too talk more.

how to un-come out ?,mildinconvenience-TM,ainbow,"A question i'm guessing a lot of you have asked but not many(?) have succeeded in. Thing is i'm still quite the tr\*nny and stray away further from my AGAB everyday, lol. But sadly coming out to my ""liberal supportive parents"" was not how I expected. Surprise! they're mildly transphobic. coming out has not gotten me any closer to transitioning, has not gotten them to use my pronouns, and has now given them new ammunition for making me feel  bad, ""you have time to worry about stupid identity politics and who you are, but don't get good grades?"" a common phrase I hear usually followed by spit spewing in my face from my screaming father :/ even better yet is i'm not fully out to them since to them me being male-aligined is a possibility they have made very clear they are not fond of, ""oh thank god you don't want -the surgery- hah that would be too much"" etc... and telling them i'm a transmasc (and also a lesbian which would break their brains) would make them 100% certain I spend too much time thinking about gender and that its the cause of all my problems as they have said before. Basically daily almost-micro-agressions that I would rather not deal with. 

so, considering the prior rant, would it be possible to convince them ""oops I was so totally definitely wrong, let's forget about this whole thing"" without having them hold that over me too? because coming out just made my life worse and the whole ""free of the burden"" thing is totally not worth it to me"
Rant About My Possibly Transphobic Mother [Family/Friends],remonataba528o0b2,ainbow,"So, as you may know from my flair and previous posts, I am genderfluid (most likely). I want to come out so people will not call me by my legal name and I will be able to get a binder. However, I'm quite sure my mom is transphobic and will kick me out of the house. One comment I remember her making was ""Don't call (sister's name) 'bro' or 'dude'. I don't want her to get any bad ideas."" (She was referring to the fact that my ten-year-old sister had recently cut her hair super short. She didn't want my sister to be anything but a girl.) I'm planning on waiting until after quarantine to come out as my cousin will let me move in with her in the circumstance that I get kicked out. This is kind of just a rant and also a question: How do I try to change my mom's mind?"

"I hate hearing ""you're too young""",bi_dad48,ainbow,"I can't stand it when it hear or see that a parent or someone tells a person "" you're too young"" or ""it's just a phase"".  First why would you invalidate someone's feelings like that. You basically just told that person that they can't understand their feelings. You know how you feel don't ever be discouraged by those statements. Secondly as a parent or guardian before dismissing your child so easily have a conversation with them. Find out why they have these feelings.  I believe the reason you don't is because you may find out your child is right and you'd have to admit to yourself you've really known all along. Kids or teens hell even adults please listen your feelings are valid it doesn't mean that as you grow and mature your feelings won't change they could and that's ok. Sexuality and gender are fluid sometimes they stay constant sometimes they change.  For instance you come out as gay say at 14 and that's how you stay. Other times you might think at first you're gay but as you grow you become to realize you're bi or pan or anything else. Its ok don't worry if it changes. Your feelings were right in the beginning its ok that they changed don't worry about what people will say now its your life not theirs. Don't be discouraged if you hear""you're too young""  go with your feelings you're right to have them. My DM'S are open to talk if you have questions."

Explanations of bullying I received

1. **Bullying for being gay:** (Both Post Coming out and after) which did not bother me too much past the age of 14 as I was ready to come out just undecided on the way, but it aided beforehand on my identity issues and caused me to be very reserved into who I would talk to about it. And kept me from coming out publicly for a very long time.
2. **Physical Abuse:** I got beaten, spat at......

Family,bi_dad48,ainbow,One of the biggest issues individually we face is losing family and friends. I know on the grand scheme of things this seems small but to the person who just came out its huge.

I've been out 34 almost 35 years and there are still times I wish the phone would ring and its would be them apologizing and welcoming me back. Yes we all learn how to cope and deal and move on but its not the same. I try to help people and be a family figure but I can't in all honestly I can only be a substitute. Now I still want to help those who need it I always will that's why I always say my DM'S are open but I know I can't take away all the hurt.

My beef with 3rd person pronouns,twystoffer,ainbow,"I want to preface this: I'm not against pronouns or the sharing of such. They make sense *in a very limited context*.

My beef is that they are insufficient, and the current idea of sharing them should be replaced with the sharing of preferred titles and/or salutations.

One thing I hear a lot is ""use these pronouns to address me"".

No. I'm not going to say ""Hello, Her. How's the weather?"" Or ""Hi, him, how are you?""

The pronouns are used for third person context only, which is to say unless you're a celebrity or popular in general, they'll hardly ever be used. People will address you by name, title, or salutation (or in rare cases all 3 at once).

Most of the time, people are going to address you by name.

But, you may be thinking ""pronouns are an easy way to express gender"".

Yeah? So are gender titles. Male, female, non-binary, and the technicolor rainbow in-between. 

People can easily guess the right pronouns. For instance, when Elliot Page came out as a guy, people knew to refer to him as him without being told specific pronouns.

But titles and salutations cannot be guessed as easily. Identify as a guy but want to be addressed only as Sir and not Mister? Two married women, and one wants to be known as the husband (true story)? Prefer to be addressed by name only, no titles or salutations? (Again, true story).

Share THOSE. Make a mention of gender if you feel it's necessary. If you keep getting called ma'am, you don't correct people by saying ""I'm a he/him"", you say ""I'm a guy.""

So...am I crazy? Am I an asshole? Or does this make any sense?

(Side note: she/they he/they combos are redundant. Everyone can get called they/them.)"

Does Autogynephilia = Transgender?,NewPhilosopher966,ainbow,"I have seen the estimate of gender dysphoria incidence to be 0.003% - 0. 014%. Yet 0.6% of people identify as trans. That means around 2% of people who are 'trans' have dysphoria or have experienced it. Many people claim ''you don't need dysphoria to be trans''. Non dysphoric trans people transition due to a phenomenon known as 'Autogynephilia' which is sometimes called ''gender euphoria''. ''Gender euphoria'' as a reason for transitioning is a common euphemism for ''fetish'' used by autogynephilliacs as well as the people who support them.

An example of this would be a man, where they were fine having a man's body, but they experience sexual arousal by the thought of having breasts and a vagina. This type of transgender is a choice as fetishes are not innate, and acting upon a fetish is a conscious choice.

Dysphoric transgender people transition due to the sex of their brain not matching the sex of their bodies (this was visible on MRI brain studies a few years back). Gender dysphoria is not a fetish or a choice and it's present from birth, generally worsening around puberty. Transgender people often have endocrine abnormalities, brains that are structurally analogous to their preferred gender.

Do you personally consider people with autogynephilia to be transgender?"

There are a number of watch faces for the fitbit watch-style trackers (the current versa/sense models) but none of them were *quite* right. Some didn't show enough stats, some weren't inclusive enough, or only showed the ""standard"" 6-color rainbow.

So I made my own. It  began with me wanting all the stats and an option for the Progress Pride flag, because that one really speaks to me. I also wanted an  option to include the Philadelphia Pride flag, and an icon for #BLM -  because it bears being displayed.

What it became now includes **several many**  pride flags (although not as exhaustive as the flair emoji here!) for  GSRM folks and sexuality-based social groups. These also include the  ""icons"" that go with them such as the polyamory pi (and alternatively,  the polyamory infinity heart). Pick and choose your flag and customize  or remove your icon. Show your pride your way!

And to clarify, it's totally free, and i made the whole thing open source. I don't get anything out of this, just want anyone who wants to show their pride to be able to do so.

"Need Help. I am a straight cismale, and my wife recently came out to me as gender-queer.",testlap,ainbow,"TL;DR: Want to be as accommodating, and understanding as possible for wife that has recently come out as gender-queer. 


Preface: My wife and I have been married for a few years now. When we got together, she told me she was bi. I have absolutely no problem with that., and even encouraged her to get a girlfriend as I know I wouldn't be able to satisfy all of her wants and needs. 

Side note, we have under-age children (step kids for me) and an Ex that is always trying to find things to use against her, so she has decided to keep the ""she/her"" pronouns for now.

About 2 months ago she tells me that she hates her underwear, and buys several pairs of boxer-briefs because she is tired of getting wedgies or her ""bits"" getting pinched etc.. Okay, I have no problem. Although, as a straight male I do enjoy her body, and she has a great butt that ""normal"" panties really accentuate. I'm a little sad that she won't be wearing thongs or panties that show off her assets to me, but I want her to be comfortable. I would be miserable too if I was expected to wear something uncomfortable all the time. 

Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago. She and I are snuggled up in bed, we are talking about our respective days, and she tells me that she has always been uncomfortable in her own skin, and that she has always felt different. She hates wearing women's clothing, with the exception of dresses and skirts because the free flowing, non restrictive fabric. She hasn't shaved anything in several months. I don't actually remember the last time she shaved. I do like the look of clean shaved vulva, and nice smooth legs, but again, I want her to be comfortable. She also cut all of her hair off. She had chest length hair, and cut it down to ""pixie"" length. All of this within the last few weeks, and as we were laying there, she reiterates that she has always felt different, and that some days she feels more masculine and some days more feminine. This is where she tells me that she feels ""trans or maybe more gender fluid."" She has always been a bit ""tom-boyish"" so I didn't really think anything of it. I feel proud of her for being true to herself, and I want to be everything she needs, or as close as possible. She reassured me that she's not looking for a girlfriend, and doesn't want to leave me or anything. She is just tired of conforming to the expectations put upon her as a ""female.""

A few days ago, I get home after work, and she is wearing ""men's"" pants and a unisex shirt, and I look at her and comment ""you look very butch, or maybe androgynous."" I regretted it instantly, and knew I shouldn't have said anything. She did get offended and said, ""I'm just wearing comfortable clothes."" I apologized, and just shut up. I didn't know what to really say. She reminded me of Rachel Maddow in street clothes and shorter hair (which I did not say). That night, for some reason I told her that if she decided to fully transition, that I didn't know what I would do. She said she didn't plan on it, and I'm an idiot for saying it. I really am an idiot, but in my defense, this is all new. I still love her obviously, she is still the same person, 

I want to be the husband she needs me to be. I want to be as understanding and accommodating as I can without being patronizing. I want her to still be comfortable with me and confident in our relationship."

Help With Convincing my Family that LGBT+ People Are Oppressed,Songmorning,ainbow,"Hey, sorry to be asking this, but could anyone help me with gathering some solid evidence about the discrimination and oppression of LGBT+ people in this country?

For the past few weeks, I've been meeting weekly with my dad to discuss LGBT+ rights. We're both Christians, but I'm LGBT-affirming, and he's non-affirming. We've had some great theological discussions so far that have moved him closer to a position of understanding, but it gets tricky when it comes to laws and politics. He's one of those folks who thinks LGBT+ people 'aren't oppressed in the United States anymore', because they're 'mainstream' now. 

Not understanding how much discrimination LGBT+ people face and how it affects them has been a big barrier to my dad's understanding of why LGBT+ rights need to be protected. He says things like, ""Not getting offended isn't a right,"" and ""How do you know LGBT people are being fired for being LGBT? Maybe it's for another reason, but they're attributing it to being LGBT."" 

He's sincere in wanting to understand better, which is why we're having these meetings, but he's the kind of person who wants to see research studies and solid evidence before believing something. He also gets kinda fired up whenever politics comes into the picture, so that complicates things a little. 

I know it's not entirely my responsibility to convince him, but the more I can help move him towards more understanding, the better. My sister is planning to come out as trans in a couple months, so my biggest reason for doing this is to help create the safest possible environment for them to come out (nonbinary trans-femme). I'm a biromantic ace, and my dad is cool with me being ace because he relates it to celibacy, but he doesn't know I'm biro. I have straight-passing privilage, so not having had much personal experience with discrimination, I present myself as an ally in these types of discussions, with a connection to the LGBT+ community from being ace. 

I'm doing my own research, but a lot of academic studies have paywalls of $15-$50 to access them. What would be most helpful to me would be links to free research studies that demonstrate things like: 

- Higher rates of abuse in LGBT+ children (especially trans children so I can show him the importance of the laws for teachers not to tell the parents when kids come out as trans) 

- Research demonstrating LGBT+ people having less access to things like jobs, housing, healthcare, and other necessities

- Examples of hate crimes that have occurred against LGBT+ people, and research showing rates of these crimes

- Research showing how trans people are made more unsafe by being grouped with their assigned sex at birth in places like shelters, prisons, etc. 

- Anything else that demonstrates why LGBT+ people don't yet have equal rights in this country. 

If any of you have personal stories of discrimination that you would be comfortable with me sharing with my dad, feel free to share those as well. 

I hate that I have to convince people that LGBT+ people need rights, but that's where things are at right now for me, so I would appreciate any help so so much. I really want my sister to be understood by the rest of the family when she comes out."
A bit confused about my sexuality...,otakung_marupok,ainbow,"Hey, so I'm a 16 year old girl that's both romantically and sexually attracted to girls. I also find myself sexually attracted to boys sometimes, however, the thought of doing romantic stuff with them such as cuddling, kissing, dating, etc. make me really uncomfortable. Basically, I can be sexually attracted to guys, but not romantically. So um, is that normal? Is there a term for this? Please help lol, I'm really fucking confused rn :(("

It seems that I have fallen in love for the first time at the age of 33 and that person happens to be a man.,mazytesokeja,ainbow,"I have always considered sexuality to be fluid and much more complex than most people realized, hence I never felt a need to label myself. Needless to say, after most of my committed relationships being with women, I find myself rather surprised that I eventually fell for another man. 

We didn't meet too long ago but he's the closest thing I've ever had to a friend. And I've never felt so understood by anyone before. It's almost as if we were made specifically for each other. The only problem is that he appears to be straight. And I don't know how to approach him in less platonic manner without putting a risk to our friendship. Which is more valuable to me than anything we could potentially have."
Can I experience dysphoria as a cis person?,Opsdiditwrong,ainbow,"I'm cisgenderI've always been comfortable with being female and I'm fine with she/her pronouns. I identify as queer, but I tell most people I'm a lesbian since I've only ever been interested in other girls. When experimenting with gender presentation I find I like to present androgynously, and I can't stand wearing skirts or dresses, but I definitely feel female.

I started having trouble around the time I began puberty. I used to be neutral to the prospect of developing breasts, but once I actually had them I wanted them gone. I've often expressed that I wish I had a deeper voicemore specifically a man's voice. I could go on for ages, but it all circles back to desiring physically masculine traits. 

For a while I wrote it off as some side effect of having realized I was queer, or that I was simply ""copying"" my trans friends. Only I've felt this way for a couple years now, and over the past few months I've been especially conscious about it. Sometimes I feel physically ill when I recognize my breasts or feminine voice. Sometimes I have trouble even looking at my own face. Some of these things I think I've heard of my trans friends struggling with, except I'm cis.

But when it comes down to it, I look in the mirror and I've always just seen an individual. And I feel female. But apparently I don't identify with my body? Is that even a thing? I could really use any input, especially from trans people if you're willing.

(Also I'm a minor and not out to my family, so I'm not sure how much I can even do about this)"

"Heyyyy everyone, my name is Micah and I'm EhlersDanlosgender! ",itsmicahhhh,ainbow,"Hellooooooo everyone~!  I hope you all had a lovely day~! My name is Micah! I'm 22 and I identify as a Xenogender that I recently made up called EhlersDanlosgender! In case you're wondering, my pronouns are pop/crack/snap/joints! But I'll accept any pronouns! Alternative pronouns are: zebra/zebraself/zebras//'s/EDS~! It is a gender that is bendy and can contort itself, and the gender is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Just to clear some things up to avoid possible confusion, I don't biologically have EDS, meaning I don't have the gene variant associated with it, or meet the criteria for a diagnosis, but I feel like my gender is Ehlers Danlos syndrome and strongly relate to people with EDS!

There can be sub-categories of EhlersDanlosgender depending upon which type of EDS you associate to your gender the most - examples are as follows;

Vasculargender - for EDS type 4, or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome! Possible pronouns include, but are in no way limited to; blood/arteries/bleeding/aorta

Hypermobilegender - for EDS type 3, the most common type! Possible pronouns include, but are in no way limited to; bendy/bendyself/contort/contortself/flex/flexself

Classicalgender - for those who relate their gender to classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome! Possible pronouns include, but are in no way limited to; stretchy/stretchself/stretch/classical

Kyphogender - for those who relate to the kypho-scoliotic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome! Possible pronouns include, but are in no way limited to; kyphosis/kyphosisself/scoliosis/scolioself/bent/bentself

This list is non exhaustive, and you're free to extrapolate based on these examples however you wish~!

Some backstory..Most people who use Xenogenders are neuro-divergent people, but anyone can identify as a Xenogender! If you want to identify as Ehlersdanlosgender, you absolutely can and you're 100% valid! Xenogenders don't hurt anybody and gender can mean anything an individual wants it to mean, it's your identity and that's all that matters here, so nobody should judge!  All trans people are 100% valid! 

Just posting this to get it off of my chest and perhaps see if more people identify as this gender! "

Im having identity problems and Im looking for guidance,ThePhantomMusic,ainbow,"Hey there anyone who reads this! 

So basically heres the gist. Im a 16 year old guy, and Ive always been brought up as the manly-man type (put in a ton of sports, family told me I was a ladies man when I was little, ect). The only deviation from that was being put in dance classes and music, but thats pretty normal for guys where I live. On the contrary to that too, my family tends to be pretty conservative. Anyways, over the past few years, I realized Im much different than whatever notion of a person people tried to raise me as. Earlier last year I discovered that Im bisexual, but since then I actually ended up finding the girl who is now my girlfriend, and weve been happy together for a while. Only her, my sister, and one of my friends know that Im bi. Anyways thats just a bit of background.

What Im posting about now is how I want to be as a person, appearance-wise. You see, my entire life Ive had a classic guys short haircut, worn almost exclusively really relaxed type clothes (like sweatpants and shorts, khaki shorts, jeans, sweatshirts, cheap t-shirts), and just been overall a very average guy. Ive also tended to be remarked as attractive by quite a lot of girls, even though I dont see it. But honestly, Im not really happy with how I look. Really, Ive always wanted to have long hair (like armpit length) to wear a lot of different, fun ways. Ive always wanted to wear cool, out of the ordinary clothes. Truthfully, Ive always thought it would be fun to do my nails or get my ears pierced too. I just want to be the person I really want to be.

The only person Ive talked to about any of this has been my girlfriend, and she totally supports me. She actually says that shed be totally down to help me with any of it, like doing my hair or something. Because of a show Im in right now, my hair is already getting fairly long compared to normal (like 5 inches on top and 1.5 sides and back), and Ive actually found that it is pretty curly too. With summer coming up, I dont really have anything stopping me from growing it out. The only thing Im concerned about is my family being against me for it. My dad wouldnt be, but I dont know about anyone else. I dont know.

To anyone who read this far, thank you, and I guess Im just looking for advice. Should I grow my hair out? Should I worry about my family? Will I still be masculine if I do this, because I still want to be. I dont know. Im free to answer any questions though! Thanks again! 

TL;DR Im a mostly closeted bisexual guy from a pretty conservative family looking to go from an average looking guy style to growing my hair long, wearing fun clothes, and maybe even doing my nails and getting my ears pierced one day, but Im slightly afraid to do so, even though Id be much happier. Im just looking for advice or people to talk to about this"

growing up homophobic and queer,808sye,ainbow,"I don't know where to begin but I guess I will begin here- I'm gay. Im a girl, but I suppose the fact that I cant own the label of 'lesbian' is part of the reason I'm here. 

I grew up homophobic. I know that sounds weird to say, but it's true. I don't know where my homophobia came from; maybe it was catholic school, maybe it was my immigrant parents, maybe it was just something inherent to me. But the point is that I had some  awful thoughts back then. When I was around 12 I finally started to unlearn these behaviours and patterns, I didn't tell my parents about my new revelation that 'gay was okay' instead i kept it to myself. 

For almost 8 years I've been denying my own gayness. I convinced myself I was straight and now, at 21, I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I'm not. 

And it's really f\*cking hard. Even though its been a long time since I've come to accept queerness in others,  its really hard to accept in myself. 

 All of high school i did everything i could to feign being straight- i did it most of college too. And now, I feel like i've dug this huge hole of straightness and now I cant come out of it. I feel as though if i came out now, all my friends would think i've been lying to them this whole time (which is irrational because I know they wouldnt care). 

I just dont know what to do. I know the world is more progressive now and this isnt a big deal anymore, but I just cant seem to get past this. I envy people who can just accept their queerness with ease and pride because I cant. 

And I keep trying to look this up on google but I cant seem to find any one elses experience feeling like this, but im sure there have to be alot of people feeling like this 

if anyone has any advice id REALLY appreciate it"

So I'm (32F) bi and recentlyish (about 18 months ago) got into my first relationship with a woman. It's been fantastic and we're extremely happy together.

EXCEPT.

We both enjoy scissoring, and also both enjoy pretty firm pressure. What this means is that after particularly fun nights of Hulk smashing my vulva has the approximate structural integrity of chicken fried steak. I don't quite wake up black and blue, but I'll be tender to the touch for several days, often with visible swelling. This also means I'm closed for business for a while, which is a major bummer.

 That said, the sex is amazing as-is, so I don't want to mess with that aspect of it too much.

So my question is this: is there a solution to this problem besides ""Dear Lord stop tenderizing your oyster?"" Like is there a lesbian sex toy that acts as like...a bumper of some kind?

I've tried Google and the results would have been perfect if I were looking to watch BDSM lesbian porn, but weren't helpful for actually finding a solution.

I need to run away from Russia,throwaway34686,ainbow,"Hello Reddit.  I need your advice, as my entire life might depend on it.  I am an 18yo computer science student from Russia.  And every single day I dream of just running away from here and never looking back.  And this is exactly what I ask you to help me with.  So allow me to elaborate.

First of all, every single day I go to the same old college (where nobody wears masks btw, yeah, in the middle of a pandemic (also there is no vaccine)), and I fear for my life.  Why? Well I think you know just how homophobic and transphobic this country is, and I just so happened to be both.  Its pretty common for LGBTQ+ people to get beaten up, or even murdered.  I heared so much hate even in my own class, luckily none of them was trying to get violent with it, which I cant say about a lot of other people I had to met at the same college.  Why wont I report this stuff? Well, because its the \*norm\* for people here to be homophobic, transphobic, rasist, nazi, and all other beautiful things, which are encouraged through TV and social media propaganda.  Also my parents are all four of these, as well as abusive asshole, so thats nice.

Besides that, we are sort of on the verge of a war, and Id be lying if I said that Im not kinda terrified, also, like 80% of the population lives in borderline poverty, also also, the whole Navalny riot is pretty much done, protestors got beaten up by the police, some accidently fell out of the windows, you know, the usual stuff.  So there is no hope of the regime going down.

I cant keep going like that, I got officially diagnosed with the depression 2 years ago, and I honestly dont see a point in living if Ill have to stay here.  So yeah, thats pretty much the entire story.  Now comes the question: is it possible for an 18yo me, with only about 200,000rub (\~2,200eur/2,600usd), pretty good knowledge of English, and some programming skills, to escape this hellhole?  If I have a choice itll be somewhere in Europe, just not Eastern.  I need your help, thank you."

Am I gay?,wonderfulworld25,ainbow,"Ive been struggling with my orientation for awhile. Im not sure if Im gay or bisexual. 

The thing is that Ive watched gay porn since I was in my early teens. I would always get off to that content. Yet when I look at my future, I always see myself getting married to a woman, being in a straight relationship. 


Maybe this is because I just dont see myself being gay to work out with my circumstances. My mom wants me to have children and while shes not anti-gay, she just prefers that I not be gay. So I just envision the perfect life for me as being in your traditional straight marriage. 

Clearly theres a lot of soul searching I have to do on my own and asking people on a subreddit wont automatically resolve this issue. However, I just wanted to hear some perspectives from those whove gone through this kind of ordeal before. 

Thanks for reading this post. I hope it isnt too much of a bother. Im pretty new to all of this and still trying to understand what this all means. I appreciate you all for considering this post."

Changes with Sexuality since getting a buzz cut,incoguser_,ainbow,"What I'm about to say is going to be controversial

I always identified as a Bisexual woman (31/f)

But my relationships were with men

I knew I found women sexually attractive, always

Recently, I got a buzz cut

Since then, a few things have changed about my behaviours:

1. I touch my head a lot more when I'm nervous or confused - e.g. when speaking with my psychologist, I'll start rubbing my head when I'm distressed
2. I sit very, \*very\* differently now. I found myself sitting in a traditionally masculine way. I've always done this somewhat when at home, but not even to this extreme. Now, I find myself regularly and casually sitting with my legs open. I also rest back in my chair, extend my legs out, and put my arms behind my head, in a very typical \*confident, relaxed, masculine\* way. Anyone who looks at me would assume I'm gay, masculine, and most likely a dom. What's odd is a few things: - I never had this desire before, and so I wasn't consciously suppressing this desire. So where did this come from? - Also, it feels so natural, so so natural.  
Note: I'm still quite feminine at times as well. Crossing my legs, very expressive with hands and fingers, and very 'soft'. I go between both, but both of them feel like me, just have very different energies.  
I want to make a point here: I feel like a woman, I am a woman. I love being a woman. I'm 31 now and only became comfortable with this from the age of 28. But, when other lgbtq+ females meet me, they mention that I'm quite gentle, and womanly and feminine and it's really attractive &gt; even though I'm wearing jeans etc... it comes through the way I express myself. It's quite strong within me, and i love it, it feels powerful and sexy. And, I know that I'll never \*not\* feel like a woman. It's just something inside me, and no one can really diminish it. So, I want to note that here.
3. I prefer to wear pants when going out. Even if I have a nice sexy skirt, I'd rather be in pants. This desire just seems stronger than before.
4. This will be the most controversial:  
Sex: I haven't had sex in about 2 years, but I do masturbate. Now, when i masturbate, i still think of women, but I openly make it known to myself that I want to objectify them. I want them to tease me in lingerie and skirts, I want them to bend over. Fucking them seems like an achievement for me (whereas I never had this feeling/idea before..) I want to dominate them, and be in charge. But, even when I did this before, the boundary was there. Now, the line's been moved further down, and I just look at them as a sexual object while I'm in charge. It's a very aggressive, authoritative energy. It's somewhat conflicting for me, since I believe women should be treated respectfully.  
This last point has been difficult to explain. In essence, I feel like this energy isn't misogyny, but maybe in a similar family. It's definitely absolute objectification, that's certain, but it's this powerful energy in me. I'm just going to keep it at that, for now.

I'm just looking for some advice, or some thoughts.

I'm just confused. The hair cut was extremely liberating for me. I wasn't even aware that so much liberation was going to occur. As time goes on (4 months now), I find these behaviours stronger in me. I'm not sure, to be frank. I'm not sure what this is, and what this means, and how normal any of this is, or how abnormal it is, etc. The fact that so many changes have happened from a haircut, is quite interesting but unexpected and bewildering.

Thanks to anyone reading and/or responding"

I'm not gay but my new coworker is the most attractive person I've ever seen,bluefIowerredthorns,ainbow,"Last month I was introduced to my new coworker. He's the most intriguing and attractive person I've ever met and I'm guessing that what I'm feeling now can be easily identified as gay panic. I'm not gay, I'm pretty surely straight, I've had multiple girlfriends in the past and I've never looked at another man in the same way I looked at them. Hence my utter confusion. 

I'm also getting misleading signals from him, about his own sexuality. And I'm having a hard time interpreting his actions and comments. First, I don't even know his age. He might be around 30, no more than 3 years older than me. He's very elegant and distinguished? And precise in his work. He always comments on how great of a team we are. And how he's glad we met. 

He never really talks about his family or friends, or even hobbies. Except cooking. Which brings me to my last point. He invited me for dinner. In his house. I'm not sure if I'm the only one invited but at this point I'm too afraid to ask."

Trans and non-binary graphic liner that I did for trans visibility day,PikaTheKhajiit,ainbow, 
I was called a slur twice today. Happy trans visibility day!,SeaAd5422,ainbow,"So I'm barely the most out of the closet person in the world, I effectively live and present as a GNC guy until I begin medical transition, as I have to stay somewhat in the closet around my parents who are very quick to judge and bully me if I try to present more feminine (and well until I move out in a few months, I'd rather not be harassed by my own family.) However, I was in a good mood given it was trans visibility day, and I decided to put a bit of effort in. I by no means was trying to present female, it was literally just a femboy kinda look, and yet I bump into some old guy on the street and he calls me a T\*\*\*\*y and keeps walking. It took me by surprise, because I think it's the first time someone even thought I was trans, it didn't really bother me much though so I just kept going about my day.

I get home, and I'm talking with my enby friend, they identify as non-binary but not trans, and they're joking about how they can't see me because haha trans *visibility* geddit? Anyway we're going back and forth and they say something like ""Oh! These are the british T\*\*\*\*ies you keep talking about!"" (I'm out to them and british, and regularly talk about how tough it is to be trans in the UK). This really rubbed me the wrong way, I called them out on it but they haven't responded, and I generally just feel like everyone's treating today as a joke.

Breaking my silence about the r/lgbt situation,throwawayz27333,ainbow,"Hey. So, I've been contemplating posting this for a few days. I just didn't know where or how. Please read everything.

I posted on r/lgbt semi frequently and so got curious about the drama. As some of you know, the head mod /u/nekosune was found to be in connection with Aimee Challenor and her husband Nathan Knight. 

I don't simply believe things that are said without looking into them so I decided to do my own digging. There is strong evidence that /u/nekosune not only knows Challenor and Knight, but also had intimate relations with Knight at some point. 

Challenor, Knight and Nekosune have all been apart of the age playing furry community. Known as 'babyfurs'. Its not surprising that such a community would attract pedophiles like Knight. Although, not everyone into age play is a pedophile, I should stress. 

It's likely that Aimee and Nekosune played the role of the 'baby/child' in these instances according to what I've found. TMI, I know. 

Anyway, r/lgbt shut its doors and has yet to re open for nearly a week now. Most subreddits associated with /u/nekosune have gotten rid of her. Though it was expected since she deleted her account due to active doxxing. However, ownership of r/lgbt was given to a lifeless account /u/LoverOfBubbles, which is only logically an alt account of /u/nekosune. 

You should also know about /u/Fionacat. Nekosune gave a moderation role to Fionacat on r/lgbt. Fionacat, also known as Feefers has a heavy presence in the babyfur community and even has her own page on furwiki. Agree scroller through her furaffinity account, I found at least 100 pages of favourites and dozens of commission's she's personally purchased of furry children in obviously compromising position/poses. I'm not opposed to calling that borderline, if not straight up pedophilia. 

Either way, it's clear someone like /u/nekosune (or /u/LoverOfBubbles) should not be head mod of such a massive subreddit. She's involved in an extremely taboo kink community and promoted someone (Fionacat) to moderatordispite her obvious pedophilic interest just because shes in the same kink community as them. 

If r/lgbt reopens and they haven't promoted someone reputable and safe to head mod, please speak up about this. 

Also, I'm one of the few people who know for a fact that the r/lgbt discord group, Spectrum, still has /u/nekosune as a trial mod going under the name Kindle. 

It's possible we may need to get in contact with Reddit admins to rectify the situation since /u/LoverOfBubbles cannot be trusted to do anything than try and keep control of the subreddit while also trying to protect herself from valid criticism. 

Thanks for reading."

In all seriousness, sister (13 lesbian) and I (16 straight-mostly) are having an argument over whether people who identify as Bi/Pan Lesbians are valid. 

My argument is yes because I usually go by aggressive inclusivity, if it isnt something blatantly offensive or trolling like Supers Straight. The titles are supposed to be a personal thing that *you* use to help *yourself* define who you are, even if they dont make perfect sense logically.

Sisters argument is that these titles are Lesbophobic, Biphobic, and Panphobic, as the fact that combining these mutually exclusive titles (Bi+Lesbian/Pan+Lesbian) invalidates all three parties (thoigh mostly lesbian) involved as it implies that Lesbians can love anyone other than women. 

So, thats the argument, Im curious what yall think.

I don't experience any dysphoria, i'm femme presenting, i have long green hair, i wear much makeup but my personality and what I like doing doesn't align to what a woman typically does and in my head i feel disconnected from any gender and prefer gender neutrality in speech and clothing.

&gt;I'm not arguing for gay marriage, I'm pointing out that your logic does not beat the feels of the vast majority of people. The vast majority of people do not use logic, they use feels, as in they feel bad that gay people can't get married and feel it is unjust.

&gt;Exactly. Conservatives lost the frame game (most likely on purpose). They should have made the case that gay marriage is an attack on public health, youth innocence, traditional values, etc. The left managed to make the gays the victim and once you've managed to turn a group into a victim you can leverage the genetic dispositions of millions of normie whites who have a sense of fair play and empathy towards the underdog. That's why Jews do everything in their power to keep their foot soldier minions hidden as victims. On the dissident right we have the same pre-disposition to fair play and honor but we've seen through the gambit.

&gt;I am honestly surprised by Alan Keyes intelligence. He must be a 1-in-a-million case for Africans. Obama, whom I consider to be quite smart, got schooled by Alan Keyes in this debate; and I suspect, any subsequent one. The main reason he lost by 43 points in the race is due to the mainstream mindset in America to avoid even considering lending any support to someone with a slightly differing ideological standpoint--no matter how valid it is. Unfortunate. I greatly recommend for others to watch the whole thing.

&gt;Yup. He's probably terrible at sports, too. I hope he fathered a good number of children and is a role model for the talented tenth of his race.

&gt;He addressed a obvious fallacy common during the gay marriage debate. Conflating the general with particular: This was a favorite tactic of theirs, somehow if you support a heterosexual reproductive marriage at a institutional level then every particular case has to conform to your standard (e.g old people marrying, infertile people marrying or maybe intersex have to be banned), it's obviously dumb. No one designs or governs institutions in this autistic way.  
&gt;  
&gt;It seems pretty obvious that a state should privilege optimal conditions for child development.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't remember the gay marriage debate that well when it happened since I never cared much about it. I remember the common arguments were kinda dumb, like biblical defense (which can't be used to establish law in a secular state, also massive rise in irreligion), or it somehow personally threatened their marriage (e.g Rush Limbaugh), though many who did believe that said also it would bring about a massive change in our language, imposing gender neutral language which they were 100% right on, ""SO / significant other"", ""latinx"", ""folks"", ""state your pronouns"" are now common words in our vocabulary (maybe not latinx, but a lot of companies, US departments and NGO use it).  
&gt;  
&gt;Chirstopher Caldwell in ""age of entitlement"" gives a lot of history of the acceptance of gay marriage, here is a quote (with some annotation)  
&gt;  
&gt;[Reuters discovered in 2014](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gaymarriage-insight/u-s-law-firms-flock-to-gay-marriage-proponents-shun-other-side-idUSKBN0EL10820140610) that of the countrys 200 largest law firms, 30 were representing lawsuits against state Defense of Marriage acts. Not one was defending these laws. The gay rights activist and litigator (((Roberta Kaplan))) worked pro bono on behalf of (((Edith Windsor)))a coup, because it permitted Windsor to tap the vast paralegal and social resources of Kaplans firm, (((Paul, Weiss))). Kaplans heavily subsidized, expertly staffed machine of constitutional revision was fully armed to do battle against . . . nothing.

Now its 2021 and we understand that sexuality and gender are much more complex than being straight or gay or being a man or a woman, so surely the number is much higher. How does community exist and function in vast numbers, even when you go down to the local level?

Im introverted and socially anxious as hell, so the experience of community of any type has always been elusive for me. Picture the ultimate stereotype of the awkward bisexual with cuffed jeans who sits in chairs funny and that's me. I guess it's easier to interact with a wider circle of people online, but I have a hard time seeing it as a true experience of connection or community.

What does LGBTQ+ community mean to you? Do you inherently feel a part of a widespread network due to your identity? Is it over the internet? Is it a community in which you participate in your country, your region, your city, your neighborhood? Your immediate social circle? Do you find it in established groups of people who share your experience and get together to do a specific activity? This is something Ive felt strange about for some time, so Id welcome any thoughts about how you define these concepts!"

But in the country and community I'm living in, it is quite hard to discover my sexuality.

I did try downloading an app and getting to know this one guy. We really hit it off. But due to my uncertainty, I cancelled meeting him up twice which made me think that Im a tease.

So if possible I'd like to learn vicariously with the help of the ppl on this subreddit. Maybe it can help convince me on my own sexuality "

"Why refusing to accept ""atypical"" identities like stargender, catgender, wiigender, pupgender, frostgender, etc. is deeply problematic for the trans community",Rare-Ad-5732,ainbow,"Note: This was originally written for traa, but neither it nor transgender actually allow text posts, so I decided to post it here. It's absolutely relevant to the community at large no matter what part of it you inhabit, but the language of the post does address trans people specifically.

There's a vocal contingent of the trans community divergent from truscum that refuses to accept or even mocks identities like stargender and similar. I'm here to make the case that refusing to validate these people is not only problematic, but transphobic.

Firstly; it's an enforcement of gender roles. Not the same gender roles enforced by cis society, to be sure, but gender roles nonetheless. By denying people who take terms like stargender validity, you're positing that there's a ""wrong"" and a ""right"" way to be non-binary, which is no different than claiming there are wrong and right ways to be male or female. Typically, these people make the ""right"" way out to be ""between or in some combination of male and female."" Gender-fluid, bigender, demigender, agender, these are identities that do or can fit that definition, and among the most commonly accepted non-binary identities in the community. But restricting non-binary people to this definition is telling other people what their identity can and can't be; it's gate-keeping and enforcing a toxic set of trans-community specific gender roles. Especially egregious when you're not non-binary yourself, because then it's not even an internal discussion, but an external attack on a wing of the community you're not even a part of and have no personal experience of.

Secondly; the argument that I see more commonly accepting trans folk agree with the most often is ""they make us look bad."" The idea that the acceptance of these ""atypical"" identities into the community is bad because it will draw further attack from outside the community.

You know what this is?

It's called respectability politics. I'm sure many of you who might not have previously are starting to see my point with that definition applied to it.

It's blaming transphobia, not on the transphobes who actively perpetrate it--the oppressors of society who are responsible for the degredation, erasure, assault, and murder of trans people--but on other trans people. It's saying ""well you brought this upon yourself because you didn't play nicely enough for the cis people."" It's betraying the transgender community to appease the cis community--no, to appease transphobes. People that don't even care, and likely don't even know, if we accept atypical identities or not. Hell, these people consider even binary trans people the ""atypical identities."" Most of them barely see the distinctions that we do, and they hate all of us.

By refusing to accept uncommon terms like stargender (which I use as the example because it's the one that the haters always bring up), you're actively harming, betraying, the trans community, shafting your trans siblings to side with our enemies.

And that's why (well, one of the reasons why; basic decency is another) it's essential that all trans people be accepted with welcomed arms among our ranks. Not accused of being ""transtrenders,"" not having their identity questioned, not being told they're ""not trans enough,"" and not being gatekept based on the specifics of their gender (or lack of it).

All our trans siblings are valid!

I am specifically looking for gay and/or trans cowboys that have some documentation through newspapers or stories. I am specifically looking for cowboys in the US in the 1800s and the 1900s. Are there any other prominent individuals? How were queer cowboys treated? Are there any stories of queer cowboys who were also people of color? Are there any other good books, articles, or documentaries that I could watch for some research?"

"Do you think most or many men are more attracted a performance or costume of femininity than they are to actual women? For example they are attracted to clothes, hair, makeup. Which is why feminized men, femboys, traps, futa, ladyboys, crossdressers, drag queens, are fetishized by straight men?",Electrical-Song-2386,ainbow,"There was a radical feminist theory I read on here that men are attracted to a performance or costume of femininity and not to actual women. They said men see clothes, hair, makeup, nails and are attracted, regardless of gender. They said this is also why tomboys are less fetishized and popular in porn and why many men are turned off by any masculine and androgynous traits in women (like short hair) and why hairy unshaven women (women in their natural state) are such a turn off. (Because women themselves are not as attractive, pre shaven. Again meaning men are not attracted to women and men like the performance of femininity by shaving all the body hair.)


I think biologically speaking men haven't changed much since Ancient periods and in history where various documents tell us that men liked to have sex with submissive feminine boys and men and the boys were seen as the shameful ones who brought it upon themselves for acting feminine and taking the feminine role. I think this attraction to femininity and submissiveness rather than to women has continued to this day.

On Jerry Springer they used to have feminized men come out to their straight male love interest, the straight male love interest was always really shocked and got violent, saying he had no idea. But the thing is...these feminized men mostly looked manly, had deep voices, angular faces, even Adam's apples. It was so obvious to me watching, and I realised the straight men just saw the long hair, dresses, makeup and heels and that was enough. The costume and performance. They couldn't clock them. I have also read that femininity in itself is seen as sexual and flirtatious, so a man making himself feminine is seen to be wanting sexual attention and as being submissive. Whereas masculinity is the default and serious, so a woman becoming masculine is seen in that way.

I noticed this is not true for straight women and gay men, who do not fetishize nor watch porn of masculine women nor tomboys, reverse traps, drag kings and so on. And they like men whether feminine or masculine, a masculine woman would never be enough because they are biologically female and have a vagina, etc. For example gay men and straight women can like androgynous men like David Bowie, Adam Ant, and any 80'a male Idol really, who all wore makeup. These men were all heartthrobs and feminine. Gay men can like both twinks and bears. Straight women can like pretty boys in K Pop bands, metal heads who wear makeup, manly men like Tom Hardy and Ryan Reynolds and everything in between.

I would say the only people who really appreciate butch women (and tomboys) are lesbians.

What do you think? Are most or many men more attracted to femininity than they are to women? Why are feminized men more fetishized?"

I do everything I can to make sure hes sexually satisfied but Im struggling wrapping my head around  him spending 85% of his time on his phone looking at other women/sexual images. Is it possible to look at others too much?   I respect staring at whoever they find attractive but designing all your socials to be constantly sexually satisfied has to have an effect no?"

""Lived in Pakistan so can't speak for all Muslim countries but:

 I strongly do believe that yes, sexuality quite often does depend on availability of women. Education in Pakistan was gender segregated until the age of 16 ish. Before that, there used to be boys in my grade used to get it on with each other.



 2 men having premarital sex is definitely seen as more sinful than man and woman doing it. But men having premarital sex is not even talked about so I guess there is less risk of bringing that ""dishonour"".



BBC has a great documentary called ""How Gay is Pakistan?"", where they show how a lot of men who have gay sex actually don't consider it as part of their sexuality (this is of course bs and internalised homophobia). It's more like a sexual relief thing.""

And:

""As a European who has been to Morocco and had sexual fun with local guys over there, without even having to ask them ""are you gay?"" or ""you into guys?"", I can confirm the fact that men have sex with each other prior to marriage with a woman as a cultural norm.

Sex with another man is not considered pre-marital sex. This gay sex before marriage is an extremely common, widely-practiced part of their culture - and a very ancient tradition. Probably if you asked most straight-identifying Muslim/Arab men, they would deny it or say they know nothing about it, but believe me (from my own experiences in Morocco) - it is true.""

The same apparently happens in prisons, boarding schools, the military/navy, with Catholic priests, etc. And women in these same gender segregated and sexually repressed places or situations have sex with women far less.

It makes me believe straight male sexuality depends SOLELY and only on the sexual availability of women, but female straight sexuality depends on many things that cause their attraction to men. So to me this means women love men more, are more straight. Men are straight until sex is not available, then they replace women easily.

I think if it became physically impossible for men and women to have sex in this world, men would ditch women and turn to other men and women would be chasing men, clingy and not as quickly or easily turn to other women.

What do you think? Do you agree and see this as a common thing? Or do you believe it is a minority of men who do this?"

toxic relationship followed by spiritual awakening,giovanniaie,ainbow,"Hey everyone - I've been trying to do some inner work on myself after getting out of a very toxic relationship after two years. It was bad... I was 23 going into something I had never imagined to be so detrimental to my health. The emotional abuse on myself caused by none other than the thinking ego caused the ultimate self-destruction... in light of this I stumbled upon spirituality and meditation. I truly believe this has helped me immensely. I've been so drawn into this area that my life has become solely based around meditation and spirituality... I just recently read Secrets of Meditation by davidji which is great for beginners like me and made  a YouTube video about it just going over the techniques that resonated with me [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chIqaEVXK6I&amp;t=17s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chIqaEVXK6I&amp;t=17s) . They have helped me over come some really dark areas of my life by fully welcoming them and hugging the crap out them (haha) and letting it dissolve away from my thoughts completely.

Realizing you are not your past has helped me tremendously overcome such a dark period of my life. That being said there is still tons of work to do and I hope that these meditation techniques can help anyone else in a similar situation.

Im excited to have found this subreddit. If anyone has read this book or does use meditation to help with life overall, I would love to hear more about it, which techniques have helped and how it has changed  your life for the better :) comments and my DM's are open!

cheers,

Educate a newly awaken gender non conforming,ihavebeeantenas,ainbow,"Hello to all.

First of all, I am humbly stating that I am studying carefully all the details about every type of self identification. I believe that part of being (trying to be) a decent and cooperative human being is to accept and be humble to embrace all that comes with our humanity.

Thay said, being human is what I identify with. After 40 years, when I first read about the gender non conforming reality, it was like being stricken by a fireball. That is exactly how I have been feeling all my life. I hate the fact that the way I look boxes me into being treated in specific ways and I loath the gender pressures that surround us in every layer of life. I always, always felt human. 

After studying philosophy, jungian psicology and etc, I understand how damaging to our societys core is to be seen as male or female and all the pre conceived expectations of behaviour looks and all that regard it.

 I was born a woman, I am tall and have a curvy body of sorts, and that, in my pre adolescent mind made me a target of unwanted interactions and I have since nurtered a deep resentment over this. 

I just wanted to be, exist, without having to be reminded all the time that the way I exist provoked actions I loathed and could not avoid from others. 

I got into arguments with woman friends that trashed men for being sensitive, vulnerable, honest, and I have got into arguments and all sorts of heated exchanges in life because I felt Invaded on my personal safe space just because I look like a woman. 

This has since caused me sadness, angriness, and few people in my life path understood what I felt when I debated those thoughts. The people I admire and relate to as role models are in my soul's eyes simply human, the only requisite...how many of my idols from the past would have different gender pronouns if they were alive these days!

I feel free. I feel embraced. I feel that this anger I have carried and buried deep inside of me has a name: unconformity. It was never about my sexuality, but how I perceive myself as a human, and by proxy how I empathize with other humans. 

Please, educate me on anything you like. I feel so glad to finally put into a concept how I have always felt. I am a nerd and I want to be educated properly! Thank you in advance and simply for having the space to share this "

So my friend is at the same class as me and he is really touchy, extremely touchy, like we give many hugs and slaps in the but and like long times touching our hands like in a kinda lovely way without looking to our eyes because it would be really uncomfortable. He yesterday told  me jokes about sex with me like he cumshotting my mouth and idk. In fact ive noticed that when i was removing my shirt, he started to touch his dick. Some people tell him if he is gay for doing all that and just dont answer. He is really masculine appart from that kind of behaviour and in the other hand he talks a loooot about girls like really exxagerated like he talks about girls even more than clearly straight people and that is what makes me feel confused, my theories are that he is a really weird straight or that he is at least bi and he wants to cover it. I dont know guys, give me your opinions about what do you think he is and what should i do then."

The same apparently happens in prisons, boarding schools, the military/navy, with Catholic priests, etc. And women in these same gender segregated and sexually repressed places or situations have sex with women far less.

It makes me believe straight male sexuality depends SOLELY and only on the sexual availability of women, but female straight sexuality depends on many things that cause their attraction to men. So to me this means women love men more, are more straight. Men are straight until sex is not available, then they replace women easily.

I think if it became physically impossible for men and women to have sex in this world, men would ditch women and turn to other men and women would be chasing men, clingy and not as quickly or easily turn to other women.

What do you think? Do you agree and see this as a common thing? Or do you believe it is a minority of men who do this?"

"I have been told that sex between men is common in Muslim countries due to gender segregation, sexual repression &amp; no sex before marriage, but that sex between women is not common. Is this true? Does this mean that straight male sexuality depends solely on the sexual availability of women?",No-Pick-1739,ainbow,"How can I learn to feel like a sexual being and flattered by male sexual attention even though straight men replace women so easily for sex with other men when women are not available in gender segregated and sexually repressed places like in Muslim countries?

Comments that I recieved about how common sex between men is (due to gender segregation and sexual repression) on the askgaybros subreddit:

""Lived in Pakistan so can't speak for all Muslim countries but:

 Topping is seen as gay but less dishonourable than bottoming.



 I strongly do believe that yes, sexuality quite often does depend on availability of women. Education in Pakistan was gender segregated until the age of 16 ish. Before that, there used to be boys in my grade used to get it on with each other.



 2 men having premarital sex is definitely seen as more sinful than man and woman doing it. But men having premarital sex is not even talked about so I guess there is less risk of bringing that ""dishonour"".



BBC has a great documentary called ""How Gay is Pakistan?"", where they show how a lot of men who have gay sex actually don't consider it as part of their sexuality (this is of course bs and internalised homophobia). It's more like a sexual relief thing.""

And:

""As a European who has been to Morocco and had sexual fun with local guys over there, without even having to ask them ""are you gay?"" or ""you into guys?"", I can confirm the fact that men have sex with each other prior to marriage with a woman as a cultural norm.

Sex with another man is not considered pre-marital sex. This gay sex before marriage is an extremely common, widely-practiced part of their culture - and a very ancient tradition. Probably if you asked most straight-identifying Muslim/Arab men, they would deny it or say they know nothing about it, but believe me (from my own experiences in Morocco) - it is true.""

When coming out once just isn't enough,Cyclone_Tarpit,ainbow,"I came out about 3 years ago, and lets just say it was not great, which is why I'm about to cry for a bunch of random people on reddit, or maybe not a ""bunch"", just the one or two who sort new, but thats okay, buckle up for another thrilling coming out story. 

Bye the time I told my parents that I liked boys, I had already told my friends, who promptly stopped being my friends, but fuck them, I was positive my parents would accept me and then maybe after that I could make some gay friends and find a boyfriend and live happily ever after. That was a big NOPE. 

So there I was the following day packing up my things. Wondering if its even legal to kick out a 17 yr old, and thinking to myself, oh god fuck why did I just blow up my entire life without having a plan first, I'm so dumb.

I just couldn't face school so I never went back. A week later I was living by myself in a shit apartment, with a shit job, curled up on a shit couch and crying every night. Have you ever just looked at your phone, at your contacts and realized that every single person you know hates you? I have and let me tell you, ouch. 

I convinced myself that I was the loneliest boy in the world, and I let the pain of my life eat me alive, and to be honest I kinda enjoyed it. Did you know that you can actually feel heartache and loneliness? For me it was a really tight tingly feeling in my chest that would pulse like waves though my whole body, it got a little addictive and I thought, this feels pretty good, terrible absolutely terrible but also good.

I assume that most people, when they come out of the closet, they stay out, but oh not me, I slammed that shit shut. I picked out some curtains, a nice rug, some cool gaming stuff and hunkered down.

So here I am three years later, things are better now but I'm living a lie. I have people I care about in my life but I'm scared to death of coming out, of having no one, again, how on earth did I get in this situation. I hate myself more and more everyday and I just don't know what to do, I can't keep living like this, I just can't. 

The end.

Brits - PLEASE write to your MP about a conversion therapy ban. The British LGBT community is in serious danger.,lgbteensthowaway,ainbow,"The UK government's conversion therapy ban proposals are [very concerning](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/03/09/kemi-badenoch-conversion-therapy-ban-equalities-office-liz-truss-lgbt-crispin-blunt-john-nicolson-charlotte-nichols/). There is a risk they won't ban it for adults, they will allow a religious exception, and they have repeatedly made statements only referring to sexuality and not gender identity - risking allowing trans conversion therapy, or even banning medical transition as a form of gay conversion therapy. This sounds far-fetched but it's a common line among British TERFs. They promised to ban it 3 years ago and haven't done so.

British people: PLEASE ACT NOW. OUR RIGHTS DEPEND ON IT.

I know writing is ugh. I know it takes effort. But WE NEED TO FIGHT.

You can find your MP at [https://members.parliament.uk/FindYourMP](https://members.parliament.uk/FindYourMP).

Write them an email stating why conversion therapy should be banned, how disgusted you are that it hasn't been banned for 3 years/1000 days since the government promised to, and how it MUST protect all LGBT people of all ages including trans people. Make it clear you demand your MP support a full and immediate ban of conversion therapy. Finish off by making it obvious you expect a reply from them.

I'm not providing a copy/paste template as these are often ignored by MPs. Please write your own if you can - obviously handwrittten letters have more impact.

Then, send it to your MP along with your name and address (to show you're in their constituency).

"On a forum for gay men somebody asked if they think straight men love vaginas as much as gay men love penises, most of the men said no and they said ""they see vaginas as a means to an end only"" and ""they love their own penises more than they could ever love any vagina."" Do you think this is true?",Connect_Ad_146,ainbow,"I have also been told we live in a penis obsessed society and that this is also why many straight men like women with penises/trans women porn and fetishize and chase them. (This is also why gay men and straight women don't fetishize and chase men with vaginas nor watch trans men porn. So I also reckon straight women and gay men are more exclusively penis attracted than straight men are exclusively vagina attracted.)

And also gay men (and trans women chasers) give blowjobs way more than straight men give oral sex to women. Straight men apparently often refuse to give oral sex to women, sometimes saying the reason why they don't is because ""it's gross."" Gay men (and trans women chasers) rarely refuse to give blowjobs. Women say the reason for men not giving oral sex is ""men are selfish and only care about their own pleasure."" But if this was the case, gay men would be just as selfish since they too are men, but they aren't. So it's vaginas that are the issue.


Also boobs seem to be seen as the most womanly, feminine and female defining feature and have become the genitalia of women, to men or the equivalent to penis. Some would say everyone can appreciate boobs and penis (also why trans women can be called ""best of both worlds.)


Also straight men came up with jokes about vaginas like ""fishy"" ""beef flaps"" ""axe wounds"" and there is no vagina type as idealised and revered by them as a large penis is. Many draw penises everywhere, joke about them, compare and brag.

What do you reckon?"
"Unpopular Opinion: ""Genital Preference"" Is As Homophobic As ""Sexual Preference"". Please Stop Using It.",TeenageDarren,ainbow,"With the recent TikTok ""Super Straight"" drama, I've seen alot of trans right activists use the word **""genital preference""**.

As a gay man, I find this term highly offensive and homophobic as fuck.

It implies my sexual orientation/determination for male genitalia is influenced by the environment. It implies that my sexual orientation is subject to conscious or unconscious change. 

*A preference is literally defined as having a greater liking for one option over the other.*

I have a preference for vanilla ice cream. I don't prefer chocolate ice cream. But if it was the only ice cream available I would eat chocolate ice cream.

We don't use the term ""sexual preference"" in lieu of ""sexual orientation"" anymore because the term implies that gay men and lesbians simply ""prefer"" the same sex over the opposite sex and that they are capable of liking the opposite sex if the other option is not available. It implies choice. It implies our sexual orientation is as much a choice as a food tastes.

Today we consider the term ""sexual preference"" to be an offensive slur. 

In fall 2020, Am Coney Barrett used the term ""sexual preference""  at the Supreme Court hearing confirmation and she was justifiably called out for it.

The term ""genital preference"" is equally offensive because it implies our sexual attraction to same sex genitalia is a choice. 

A gay man prefers a penis over a vagina.

A lesbian prefers a vagina over a penis.

Just like ""sexual preference"" implies that sexual orientation is a choice? ""Genital preference"" implies that sexual attraction to same sex genitalia is chosen as well. 

I didn't choose to like dick. When puberty came around, I saw a boy's dick for that first time and I was like **""WANT""**. My attraction to male genitalia is part of my sexual orientation. 

If ""genital preference"" is valid, then what about ""gender preference"". Is my attraction to men with abs and muscles a preference as well? 
If so, then by logic my attraction to men must also be preference.

You see it's a slippery slope with uncomfortable inferrals.

What's even worse is that some trans activists are using the term ""genital preference"" in the same context as ""racial preference"".

This is also highly offensive because it's essentially gaslighting gay men and women to be ashamed for only liking same sex genitalia.

Sure it's okay for a white person to only like white people but you're kinda racist.

Sure it's okay for a lesbian not to like dick but that makes you kinda transphobic.

We're equating gay people to racists for not liking opposite sex genitalia. It's absolutely asinine. 

The very foundation of the gay rights movement is that we should not feel shame for our sexual attractions. Our sexual attractions are valid and as intrinsic to our being as the color of eyes.

Gay people should not feel shame for their sexual attractions.

We do NOT need members of our own community telling us that our sexual orientation is something to be ashamed of. 

There's alot of tension between the gay and trans community and using ""genital preference"" isn't helping to foster relations."

Yes, they do own a razor. It's cheap and they get razor burn VERY easily. Unfortunately it seems like that's an inherited trait - hence my own lack of knowledge in this area.

How to get over this guy when everytime we xhat he changing my mind?,ADHDBENZOBOY,ainbow,"Im from czech republic, so it sucks to find someone normalfor relationship, im 23 and he's 20yo, he's more masculine but inside emotionaly like drama Queen as me, I met him last summer, when know each other, because i was loving in same village but we werent close friends, i didnt knew that he is bi, so surprisingly he came to my city where i live and told me that he wants to have some side-relationship, beacuse he have girlfriend, but it must be our secret, next week my old flatmate came to visit me, they know each and i was so happy about it that i told him this situation. After this i felt very bad for broke the promise so i call that bi guy that he knows it, but he will not tell this to anyone, but he gets mad and said that we ending with our secret. I felt horribly i have some anxiety issues and emotional personality disorder from past and i was very self-destructive, self-loathing, lost my job, almost end up like a homeless. In couple months, we start to text again, but our relationship aint fixed yet, he sending mixed singnals, one day it seems like we could have something between us, second day he is like im emberrasing that im still trying even that he told that we wont have anything between, it's still this vicous cycle, one day im like im ending this nonsense and ignoring him but he sending me message and wanna talk so im again in it, everytime it ends with fight and than again we are okay, it seems he enjoying my attention that i stilk want him and i want to fix my mistake, he's lion, i dont believe in this bullshit but the characteristic is very accurate on him. I know that im idealizing him, but i cant quit it, cos i feel very lonely without his attention, he had some issues when he was younger because he had a boy and have some bully for that. So he dont trust, but im trying to fix from beginning, its almost half a year and we aint good. I have anxiety from wasting my time, but he sending some signals that we could be something, my big problem in this case is that he is really the dream boy, i live in capital city, but gay men here Are really boring and i dont like their mentality.. So it's like give him a chance and maybe it could be something or nope (wasted times) or forget about him but he will text me back, so ignore him, i really dont know what to do, it feels like he's using me only for his own good feelings of being wanted im also very needy guy, that sucks, im trying to make song for him, im producing beats and i just start to writing songs, but this drama makes me feels sick...

Hate to ask but Im in a spot. Is there anyone who can help? Sorry if Im being a nuisance.,electricturtlebar,ainbow,"Hello. I hate to ask and do this and I know it looks suspicious as hell but it isnt. Ive had a horrible year. I lost my job, couldnt get unemployment, family member died, and then to top it all off my grandpa got cancer and I had to take him back forth to the doctor 5 days a week. It was a 45 mile trip one way. He didnt have much money and gave me what he could but I exhausted all my savings helping him and other expenses I regularly have and it has left me broke and without food or anything. I really dont know what Im going to do. I searched for a job and finally got a call today from a call center and they want me to start work next week. It would help me get on my feet and finally pay some bills and help my confidence too. Ive never worked in a call center but I think I can do it. Its a 35 minute drive one way (I live in a rural area) and I dont have any money for gas or food or anything. I know this is desperate and sounds awful, but if anyone could loan me some money on here I could pay you back when I get paid. I have cashapp, paypal and Venmo. I would try and borrow the money but my credit is ruined and dont really have any close family I could borrow off of. Again, I know this sounds shady and I apologize for doing it but Im desperate. I will delete is asked, and even if you cant help me please send some good vibes and prayers my way. Thanks."

How do I better explain to my colleague that a trans kid would understand their gender earlier than a gay kid would understand his sexuality?"

True story. Just wanted to tell someone.,storytellingme,ainbow,"Me and this guy Justin had been texting for about 3-4 days. We'd known each other for longer but never exchanged numbers. I'd told him how hot I think he is and he'd said I was cute too with a nice butt so anyway some friends and I were hanging out drinking and I started feeling bold and horny... Me and Justin had made eye contact several times throughout the night and I walked up to him standing at the kitchen island and turned around and kind of danced/gyrated/grinded my butt on him I was instantly nervous with delight when he put his hands on my hips and grinded back... I turned around and kissed him right on the lips and made eye contact... I seen the Desire in his eyes and we made out for a few minutes. When he started grabbing my butt I told him not to start nothing jokingly and he said he wouldn't start anything he couldn't finish. He was so surprised when I said I would have to go home and get ready for that. It took him about half a second to realize I was being dead serious... He finally kissed me for a few more minutes then whispered in my ear ""go get ready and I'll meet you at your place"" I kissed him one more time in affirmation. When I got to my car I had a text asking how long it would take and i responded 30 mins... Fast forward and he made it to my house.. We were both clumsy and hungry as we kissed and grabbed and stripped each other down. I gave him a blowjob on the ottoman in front of my couch and then lead him to my bedroom. I grabbed the lube out of my night stand and gave him good hand job for a second and he was rock hard (so was I) I got on my hands and knees and the rest is history... It lasted a lot longer than I thought it would too. Tbh it was really good and I will definitely be doing it again lol Might even make him my boyfriend who knows"

I asked my mother to pray and ask God why I don't like men. She refused.,chobibi,ainbow,"Today, I started a conversation about how not every couple is sex-focused. I have been thinking how big a difference is in the mindset of having an innocent overnight with a best friend vs a partner. She said the difference is that you mustn't subject yourself to temptation by staying the night with a partner. Personally, I didn't grow up understanding the nuance behind certain things regarding relationships. For me, it makes perfect sense for a married couple to not have sex. Such a thing is unfathomable to my mother. 

For example, Netflix and Chill is something I had a hard time understanding. One time I asked my cousin if it was ever just Netflix and nothing more and she told me never, not when it's with a significant other. That was odd to me. Anyway, back to my mother, I asked her to ask God why I'm like this. Why I don't like men. She told me very bluntly that she won't, didn't even entertain the idea. In her mind, I'm making a choice and ""choice"" is a word that honestly sets me off but I can't control others. I've tried several times to convey that LGBT isn't a choice but in my religious family, it goes in one ear and out the other. 

I simply said, ""I apologize in advance for your inevitable disappointment in me."" At first she had a typical response, light-heartedly asking what I was talking about and she hardened when I explained. Her tone changed and she told me that I don't have to worry about disappointing her. It's God who I have to worry about disappointing.  

It's the way some religious people will pray to change people by opening their hearts to God, or to pay for a harmful behavior if they've committed an offense, but won't ask God why their child isn't ""natural"". Their noses are stuck in the business of others and the choices they make, but no, not when it comes to orientation I guess. Suddenly it's ""that's not my business"". 

Frankly, I went through a period of anger at religion because I knew that I wasn't putting myself through the pain of not being straight in a society that it's a norm in. It is something I can't control. Now, I'm still finding my footing in that realm but I'm still nowhere near where I was in the church years ago."

Does anyone remember when the HRC threw trans people under the bus with ENDA? It looks like the Equality Act is not much of an improvement.,sorcerykid,ainbow,"The Equality Act was introduced for the first time to the U.S. Senate yesterday. However, I remain concerned that the proposed statutory language is highly problematic and misleading. 

The bill attempts to equate ""sex"" with gender identity and sexual orientation. It further attempts to equate ""gender identity"" with appearance and mannerisms. Both of these definitions, however, are completely at odds with LGBTQ discourse of the past 30 years. By making all such concepts legally equivalent, it certainly reverses course from work in academia, activism, and other disciplines.

https://preview.redd.it/wml24u8rlgj61.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4b133ce8fa154535eb9e90029baeaead8d40b28

Why are we not properly codifying these as three separate classes: ""Sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression"" which is how several states have enacted their own human rights laws, instead of shoehorning all LGBTQ people under the banner of ""sex""? 

It is sorely disappointing that after campaigning for nearly 50 years to enact federal equal rights legislation, this is the product of that long-lasting effort. LGBTQ people deserve recognition and protection of their distinctive and defining qualities, given the merits of each, not merely as a footnote to the pre-existing terminology of the Civil Rights Act. 

The bill summary is equally deceptive in that it purports that sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity are individually protected classes, when in reality ""sex"" remains its own class, wherein aspects of sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex-based stereotypes are to be subsumed.

*""Specifically the bill defines sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity among the prohibited categories of discrimination or segregation.""*

https://preview.redd.it/ycrul9swlgj61.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a2427c38647c68717173ea99e90dfe5ccfd6916

The bill text itself makes frequent reference to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people as well as women, yet there is no mention of gender nonconforming people. Like much of LGBTQ advocacy, gender nonconforming people remain an afterthought. Their issues and concerns are consistently regarded as a lesser priority, tacked on only when politically convenient or expedient.

For legislation that Lambda Legal praises as ""comprehensive and inclusive"" for a diverse demographic, this confirms that gender nonconforming people were not of principal consideration in its drafting.

While it could be argued that *Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins* (1989) addressed gender expression, that decision was never codified into federal law. Moreover, it pertained to ""sex-based stereotypes"", not presentation of one's gender. Given the timeframe of that case, it was clearly not informed by our modern understanding of sex-vs-gender. The underlying impetus was to advance women's rights in the workplace, not to tackle the broader issues of gender variance.

Last year's ruling in the case of *Bostock vs. Clayton County* established a new legal precedent: sexual orientation and gender identity are characteristics of a person's ""sex"", and thus protected by Title VII from employment discrimination. Some critics, however, argued that it is not the court's place to update or expand existing federal law as written, but rather that is the role of Congress.

Indeed, if the overarching purpose of the Equality Act is to codify full non-discrimination protections for all LGBTQ+ Americans, rather than trusting in ongoing judicial precedents, then why is the proposed statutory language effectively a copypasta of past Supreme Court decisions?

For such impactful, long-lasting legislation, I would hope that the Equality Act could be drafted in a manner that is more accurate and consistent in its use of terminology, such that it reflects our commitment to full equality, and thus can serve as a model for LGBTQ rights worldwide."

Why is gender important?,somejoeschmoe,ainbow,"So we were dealing with gender studies at school a couple of months ago and one thing I didn't understand was why gender roles and gender identities are even important. So far my understanding of it is that your gender is basically what you identify yourself with when it comes to typically male or female attributes in your personality?(please correct me if I'm wrong). However, I don't get why that even has to be a factor. What stops people from saying that they are male and like for example playing with dolls? Again, I might be terribly wrong and it's been a while since I last did any kind of research on the topic of gender. So please help me understand what gender is all about, I'm really curious but I just don't understand it. Thanks a lot"

Maybe Im just not ready even though I feel that I am. Some days I feel like I could send that message out and others where I wish I wasnt gay. I just dont want to carry this weight on my shoulders and care what people think anymore. Please, any help is appreciated."

I've had to scrub all my social media accounts and start over on EVERYTHING because the words that I have used to describe myself FOR DECADES are now 100% illegal to be posted online. I've recently been relentlessly harassed by trans people because of how I identify myself, despite having NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM and having NO PROBLEM WITH THEM but now they seem to have a problem with me and I'm actually losing my mind over this because they are EVERYWHERE and actively attempting to delete me from existence for the crime of wearing girl clothes while not identifying as a girl.

I really don't know what to do. I can't just not crossdress or not look feminine because that is a fundamental part of my lifestyle as much as any gender identity, sexuality, or religious belief. But the very fact that I do this, and the very words I use to describe myself while doing this, are subjects of an ACTIVE GLOBAL CRUSADE by an army of trans people that, for LITERALLY NO REASON, have appropriated the words that WE, NOT THEM, use, as ""SLURS"".

"Is penetrative gay sex (oral sex, etc) heteronormative and emulating/imitating penetrative straight sex (vaginal sex)? If penetrative gay sex is not heteronormative, and is not emulating/imitating penetrative straight sex, can you explain why?",SeriesInteresting210,ainbow,"This has been bugging me. ""Who's the man, and who's the woman in the relationship"" makes me cringe. But according to evolution the question has some truth to it? Women and men evolved to have certain personalities, and behaviors. Women evolved to be penetrated (making the act of being penetrated innately ""feminine"", or something only a woman does). And men evolved to penetrate (making the act of penetrating innately ""masculine"", or something only a man does).

Women evolved to be pursued. Men evolved to pursue. Women evolved to perform ""femininity"" (e.g. to be more emotional, wear dresses, make up, high heels, etc, stay at home to cook, clean, etc, take care of others ...)

And men evolved to perform ""masculinity"" (e.g. to be more aggressive, be less emotional, wear suits, ties, etc, go out to do the work, not wear dresses, make up, high heels, etc ...)

These personalities and behaviors are firmly grounded in the genes.

If I'm wrong, please explain your reasons.

But if it's like that, and I'm not wrong, then isn't penetrative gay sex (oral sex, etc) heteronormative and emulating/imitating penetrative straight sex (vaginal sex)? This article says penetrative gay sex is heteronormative, and I think by calling penetrative sex heteronormative, they are shaming gay people that have penetrative sex, while lifting gay people that have no penetrative sex up: [https://www.insider.com/the-most-common-myths-about-gay-sex-between-men-2019-6](https://www.insider.com/the-most-common-myths-about-gay-sex-between-men-2019-6)

&gt;**Several gay men also point out that sex often doesn't include penetration at all. The idea that sex includes penetration they said, comes from applying heteronormative structures to gay relationships.**  
&gt;  
&gt;""There's always pressure to have penetrative sex in the gay community,"" Robert, a 24 year-old in Brooklyn who requested a pseudonym to discuss his sex life, said. ""I think that comes from straight people defining sex for us.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Straight people tend to define sex as penetration because, for them, intimacy is often connected to having children, Guggenheim said. But in reality, there's actually much to be gained by exploring other kinds of sex.

Imagine:

Two men have oral sex. One penetrates the other's mouth. Men evolved to penetrate, women evolved to be penetrated.

And so the man that penetrates is the man, and is doing something ""masculine"", for doing what a man evolved to do, and the other man that is penetrated is the woman, and is doing something ""feminine"", for doing what a woman evolved to do?

Two women have penetrative sex with a strap on dildo. The woman that penetrates the other with the strap on dildo is the man, and is doing something ""masculine"", for doing what men evolved to do, and the other woman that is penetrated is the woman, and is doing something ""feminine"", for doing what a woman evolved to do?

Two men are together. One is more emotional, cries more, wears make up, etc, and so he's the woman, and is doing something ""feminine"", for doing what a woman evolved to do. The other is less emotional, cries less, hates make up, dresses, etc, and wears suits, shirts, etc, and so he's the man, and is doing something ""masculine"", for doing what a man evolved to do?

If penetrative gay sex is not heteronormative, and is not emulating/imitating penetrative straight sex, can you explain why?"

Gay?,pots_and_pan,ainbow,"Hi friends. I feel like a complete ass, but can you all help me explain what is going on? 

  My brother has recently said he is bi. Now, I'm a andro demi pansexual who has been through the ropes. I have an immaculate gaydar, on top of the fact that I have struggled with my identity my entire life (25 yo). I have been through the trials and tribulations of it all, on top of a not entirely accepting mom and homophobic father (not looking for sympathy, I'm thriving). I have been scared my entire life with them and my sexuality/gender, as they really haven't ever approved of the community. I have never said anything about myself as well in these terms, which they seem to appreciate to avoid the conversation, and I live my life as someone who is out regardless. 

Back to my brother, he has been unemployed for the entire pandemic and came across a group of gaymers, where he has spent every waking hour of his quarantine. Doesn't leave the house as he is solely focused on his friends. Now he thinks he is bi. He actively seeks out affirmation from his group and they are all he talks about. They also I rent leave him on read, from what he has said., which makes me.believe they don't believe him either. He used to exist as himself and we all knew him as that person. Dated women in the past. Because of the gaymers, I feel as though he wants to be a part of their group, and its ""trendy to be bi."" Now he is so excited and just talking everyone that ""I'm bi"" or ""I like this boy,"" etc.

 I think he is lonely and looking for affection in any form, as he hasn't dated or been with a woman since his teens.  (He is generally just a too forwardly emotional person and it scares a lot of the women he communicates with.) He never has given off a gay vibe and based on my senses and the fact he is my sibling, he is not gay. No inclinations whatsoever would tell me he is gay. To me, he simply is not gay. At all. Am I an asshole for not believing him? Never once has he ever questioned it and has never had a lick of interest in the queer community. In our family, you don't just say it and I am just pissed he is blowing it around like a joke. It feels like a joke and he is using bisexuality as a front for other issues. 

Its almost like I feel he got a free pass because of everything I've had to go through. My sister also agrees generally with what I am saying. She believes he is just into ""weeb"" and ""furry"" (trying not to be derogatory, as I am not bothered by it) stuff, which is confusing him. Idk. Also, all of his video games characters are females. Never played as a male, and still makes all female characters. I just can't get behind what he is saying. 

Am I being unsupportive because of this, or are my thoughts justified? Do gay men realize they are gay at 30? I know they come out later in life, but realizing they are gay that late? I just don't believe it, particularly my brother. Don't gay men know they are gay relatively early? (I don't know much about gay men, sorry. I don't want to generalize or be homophobic) What do you think?"

"Questioning myself - help, advice, and experiences hugely appreciated",MeRogic,ainbow,"Okay, prepare for this text to be a long one. But to start off I'd like to set up some points that I need you to follow if you want to constructively help me instead of doing the opposite.

\-Do NOT talk me into anything or openly judge me as being something I'm not sure about yet

\-Do NOT give me advice if you yourself aren't very comfortable and confident in your sexuality/still searching for yourself

\-Last but not least, please be respectful about my character. That means instead of talking about or concentrating a lot about what HAS happened until now I'm wishing for advice for the current state. I'm gonna think enough about the past for myself anyway.

So if you've come this far, I already really appreciate you for your perseverance. This is not gonna be a lightheaded post, so I know I'm gonna scare many people off. If you don't want to hear the stories and just my points for and against my questioning, scroll down.

So then, let's talk about myself. I'm male, 20, live in Germany, and have always felt safe around my family and friends. I never had huge difficulties growing up, except for some bullying in school around 9-11 years old and always being hugely sensitive to negative feedback or attacks. Later in school, around 12-17 years old, I tended to have not many friends but good ones at that, I never felt attracted to girls in school (nor desired really). I do have had some experiences with girls but that was in elementary school when everyone was pretty much free from gender stuff, so back there I had a kinda crush on a girl for a day, but didn't really feel too much when she said to me ""she doesn't love me though"" the next day, and I had a mini relationship (as much as you can call it a relationship with 7 years lol) with another (pretty unconventional) girl back then.

\*NSFW\* In my younger years, I also had a friend who had the idea to experiment in terms of sexuality, so we kinda blew one another under the sheets on a sleepover. Something similar happened (I think with someone else but I'm not sure any more oof) when I was at a guy's birthday 1 or 2 years later. It was kinda exciting really \^\^ I also remember feeling drawn to watch my friends underwater in the swimming pool and that some of them were playfully sexually talking about stuff which also kinda got me excited in some way :p

(attention, uncomfy porn-related stuff ahead - you can skip that if you want idk)

Anyway, something I always felt like holding me off trying stuff with girls was porn. I began watching random dating sites and softcore stuff when I was 11 and after getting recommended an actual porn site (I didn't know existed) I began watching that when I was 12 and continued until this day despite various efforts to quit. In porn, I was always interested in female-only stuff, including pov videos of various fetish fantasies that developed along the lines. Fact is, I was never interested in so-called ""heterosexual"" porn because the emotionlessness and unattractiveness of it really turned me off. I rather indulged in fantasies instead, including stuff like very womanly-looking shemales, drawn futa, and stuff like that. I also began watching hypnosis videos at some point, including stuff like bi-curious experiments and the like. I was turned on by the fantasy and turned off by the forceful feel it always seemed to contain or anxiety that it could actually ""change"" me. Don't really think it can tbh and could well imagine it had to speak to me in some way to even consider watching it anyway.

(end of porn stuff)

While beginning to study I had one experience, which was being quite drunk at a club, a friend of a new guy I got to know who was also part of a gay couple wanted to take my hand and dance with me. It felt wrong because I didn't know him, didn't find him too attractive, and knew he was there with his partner a little away. I was very surprised at the offer and denied it despite being curious. But I put it off as just being curious in general.

Anyway, what really threw me off the loop was something that happened around a year ago. I was at my place in the city where I study and knocked myself out with lots and lots of weed for too long really. Also took a kind of shrooms I could order online once. I may have watched hypnosis as well which I'm not really sure about anymore tho. Well, at some points I began having ""revelations"" about myself, like being autistic or having Asperger and also becoming extremely anxious about all kinds of stuff. I went to a hospital nearby because I was so afraid of an inflammation I had on the outside of my ears and there had to be calmed down with medication and stuff. Talked a lot of bullcrap there and was in a very different state of mind, which was all diagnosed as a drug-induced, psychotic episode. It felt like I was being freed from certain mind constraints at that time though. It felt like it was healthy being away from my mother and her influence on me and one thought, that still bothers me until now that I had back there was wanting to be a woman and identifying as something in between. I don't really know the reasoning I had behind this back then, but right now my best guess is that my mind thought being a woman would make it easier for me to find the love that I actually can get to, which would be some kind of male. I also felt extremely emotionally drawn to my best friend and had thoughts of getting into a relationship with him. But yeah, what I thought at that time and the reasons for it are hugely mysterious and hard to pinpoint.

Sometime after that, when I was at the last phase of getting out of the hospital, a bisexual guy I wanted to be friends with because he looked very nice that I gave my number hit me up not long after we got to know each other and asked whether I'd let him blow me, or if I'd like that. I was... pretty confused and unsure and just answered he could, and that I'd let it happen to see what it does to me. It never happened because, in the end, I told him I'd like to do it when I was fully healthy again if ever.

Points FOR homosexuality and the likes of it:

\-Have had some sexual experiences with males in young teens and felt comfy/excited about it

\-Don't feel like nor want to be manly

\-Never really felt drawn to women romantically in real life nor fell in love or smth despite longing for love and partnership

\-Have seen some compilations of males I know from an internet tv channel going in for a kiss/kissing in a maybe comedic but still affectionate way and found it real cute

Points AGAINST homosexuality and the likes of it:

\-Never really came up even as an option for me until now

\-Don't find the male body very attractive sexually, female bodies instead

\-Never fell in love with a male either

\-Feels strange and unnatural to dress up or make myself girly in any way, no desire whatsoever (only clich though?)

All in all, this is all just really strange and I don't even know if it feels right to think about it. Maybe I'm just confusing myself for no reason and it feels kinda dangerous to let people on the internet influence my thinking of myself. Yet it's also one of my best bets to find more about this. I know my mom has strong opinions and probably influenced me in a way of making me think I can't be homosexual. Like why should I? But it also could be that all this time I repressed parts of my true self for reasons of being normal and fitting in, as that is the way I tend to work. I have no clue.

But maybe you can help me suggest stuff I could do to feel into myself and discover more about this topic. Or tell me from your experiences, like was there a similar phase for you and what led you to become sure? Does being homosexual mean that you necessarily feel you're just that from early on? Let me know :)

As the very last thing: I came here because I for the first time in forever actually wanted to get into a relationship, so I tried out a dating app. It feels like if I'm just myself there near to no women are interested, but lots of guys are xD That's precisely what I found to be happening in life too lol I was wondering if I'm just that special of a guy but tbh throughout all of the profiles I swept through I still had yet to find someone that felt like would match me. And I thought about actually beginning to talk to dudes that have an interest in me but first wanted to be more clear about if I should or not. To not get me into something I'm not actually into. Well. Tell me what you think.

Sorry for this neverending post, but at least I know that IF someone answers it I'll hopefully get good answers.

Trans women are women. Pass it on!,Imanerrrd,ainbow, 
Please help me understand the LGBT+ community,moodybiatch,ainbow,"I would define myself as a bisexual genderless person, even though the majority of people I hang out with are not concerned enough about my sexuality and identity to actually know that.

I've never been in touch with the community. I grew up in a small town in the north of Italy where, even though people have been *generally* open-minded and progressive about the issue, the population was never big enough to actually start an in-town LGBT+ ""club"" or whatever it's called (sorry, my vocabulary has its limits).

I've always lived my life as a straight cis woman and most people I know treat me as such. I had relationships with women but never for long enough to make it official to the world, and as far as I'm concerned I still have a vagina so there's no need for me to bring up my gender identity with a potential partner. 

For these reasons, I've always had a harder time understanding the ""labeling"" that people put themselves through, expecially when talking with people that clearly are not open-minded enough to understand those things. I understand that coming out is sort of a ritual and you want to inform your friends in the hope that they will be happy with you, what I don't understand is why one would do it when it's clearly not gonna bring anything but pain and hate to themselves. In particular, when the your gender/orientation does not actually imply a change in habits (ex: genderfluid not undergoing transition, bisexual but already in a relationship with a someone from the opposite sex, etc).

I get that it might be about pronouns, but if someone is clearly unwilling to accept that I'd rather have them call me with the wrong pronouns that be disowned and despised by them for the rest of my days. 

I hope this fits here and doesn't offend anyone.
A friend of mine just came out as gay to his homophobic parents and got kicked out, and since he told me he was expecting that I genuinely do not understand why he still decided to do it. He said he doesn't want to hide but I don't see how being kicked out is better than hiding."
"Why refusing to accept ""atypical"" identities like stargender, catgender, wiigender, pupgender, frostgender, etc. is deeply problematic for the trans community",TinyAdagio8070,ainbow,"Note: This was originally written for traa, but neither it nor transgender actually allow text posts, so I decided to post it here. It's absolutely relevant to the community at large no matter what part of it you inhabit, but the language of the post does address trans people specifically.

There's a vocal contingent of the trans community divergent from truscum that refuses to accept or even mocks identities like stargender and similar. I'm here to make the case that refusing to validate these people is not only problematic, but transphobic.

Firstly; it's an enforcement of gender roles. Not the same gender roles enforced by cis society, to be sure, but gender roles nonetheless. By denying people who take terms like stargender validity, you're positing that there's a ""wrong"" and a ""right"" way to be non-binary, which is no different than claiming there are wrong and right ways to be male or female. Typically, these people make the ""right"" way out to be ""between or in some combination of male and female."" Gender-fluid, bigender, demigender, agender, these are identities that do or can fit that definition, and among the most commonly accepted non-binary identities in the community. But restricting non-binary people to this definition is telling other people what their identity can and can't be; it's gate-keeping and enforcing a toxic set of trans-community specific gender roles. Especially egregious when you're not non-binary yourself, because then it's not even an internal discussion, but an external attack on a wing of the community you're not even a part of and have no personal experience of.

Secondly; the argument that I see more commonly accepting trans folk agree with the most often is ""they make us look bad."" The idea that the acceptance of these ""atypical"" identities into the community is bad because it will draw further attack from outside the community.

You know what this is?

It's called respectability politics. I'm sure many of you who might not have previously are starting to see my point with that definition applied to it.

It's blaming transphobia, not on the transphobes who actively perpetrate it--the oppressors of society who are responsible for the degredation, erasure, assault, and murder of trans people--but on other trans people. It's saying ""well you brought this upon yourself because you didn't play nicely enough for the cis people."" It's betraying the transgender community to appease the cis community--no, to appease transphobes. People that don't even care, and likely don't even know, if we accept atypical identities or not. Hell, these people consider even binary trans people the ""atypical identities."" Most of them barely see the distinctions that we do, and they hate all of us.

By refusing to accept uncommon terms like stargender (which I use as the example because it's the one that the haters always bring up), you're actively harming, betraying, the trans community, shafting your trans siblings to side with our enemies.

And that's why (well, one of the reasons why; basic decency is another) it's essential that all trans people be accepted with welcomed arms among our ranks. Not accused of being ""transtrenders,"" not having their identity questioned, not being told they're ""not trans enough,"" and not being gatekept based on the specifics of their gender (or lack of it).

All our trans siblings are valid!

All our trans siblings are valid!

Dating when a transwoman,CandyappleWinter,ainbow,"I'm not the smartest when it comes to dating and when looking back at situations I should have known better. This is probably going to be a lengthy ppost so bare with me.

Anyway a few months ago my job had to hire several employees who never returned after the covid lay off. I'm a transwoman and everyone knows because I was a very feminine male when I first started and I've been there for 13 years. I work in a hotel casino owned by an Indian Tribe and they don't tolerate any form of disclination. My job has a very high turn over so we have people coming and going and of course the people who've known me for years always fill in the others about my trans status of course. There's nothing I can do about it, if someone has questions I'm completely honest. I consider myself fairly passable. But again I don't care if people know or not. In fact I'd rather they know so I can kind of educate people and let they see I'm a normal person.

So there were 2 men in particular who were in my orbit more and more. I really didn't think much because I know to never get involved with co-workers. But the one I'm talking about now, I'll call him Eddy. The other one in a different story I'll share another time.  When I first saw Eddy he seemed kind of cute, he was wearing a face mask so I couldn't see exactly what he looked like, but he was 6'2"" at least, skinny, with a man bun, and later I found out he was Dominican. Not that this matters, but this made him 100% my type. I was introduced to Eddy a few weeks later briefly through a mutual friend he was working with and he seemed so sweet and courteous.  From that point on he would always say hi whenever he saw me. I would run into Eddy more and more and we would talk about work and he would laugh at things I'd say and I kind of started to develop a crush on him. I might be wrong but I felt he could be attracted to me, but out of respect I never acted on it. You can't just expect every man to be attracted to you when you're transgender. 

I made the mistake of telling another friend I thought he was really cute and I believe she told him and I'm assuming he already knew I was transgender so alone that was probably  the nail in the coffin because I rarely saw him any more as if he was hiding from me. I'd see him sometimes and he seemed to totally different and acted like he didn't see me. I'd see him sitting with other females acting like a completely different person. But I'd just talk to a friend to act distracted. So whenever I saw him I did the same acting like I didn't know he was there, never looking in his direction or looking down whenever I saw him approaching.

The other day was the first day I saw him in awhile. He was in the cafeteria sitting alone and although he was several seats away I sat facing him, but acted like I didn't know he was there although I'd see him glancing in my direction every once in awhile.

Even though I still really like him I feel it's best to forget about him, Now don't get me wrong I have a lot of men who are interested in me, but none of them interest me like Eddy does.

Does the questioning ever stop?,helpmybrainrest,ainbow,"I've (19F) been in a spiral for a couple of weeks now and I blame Jojo Siwa. Seeing someone who is such a huge role model for hundreds of thousands of kids very confidently declare themselves like that was an incredibly emotional thing for me. I'm impressed by her bravery and I'm so thankful for her opening up and potentially helping tons of kids feel normal, but I havent felt okay since then.

A couple days after that I watched Love, Simon for the first time and I cried like a baby. Days later I watched Love, Victor TWICE. Before that I had never felt more validated in my journey to figure out who I am, but the euphoria I had from that didn't last for long and the days that followed were some of the worst days I had with my mental health in years. It was scary.

I'm in a much better spot now, but I can't stop (over)thinking about my sexuality. I'm not super in to labels, but to put it simply, I'm bi. It's so easy for me to say that here and I've come out on multiple private social media accounts and to friends I've made on the internet, but I don't know if I can confidently come out to anyone in person. And I know a lot of that is because the internet can feel like a safer space. It's just that ever since I found this out about myself I've never been 100% sure that I didn't make it up for attention or something. How could I be sure? I've never so much as kissed anyone and I'm not the type of person to feel immediate attraction to any person. I've had very few ""crushes"" (it takes a lot for me to be interested in someone) in my life and it brings me so much discomfort that only one of those people was female.

I've thought about just waiting to see if I ever get in a relationship with a girl and only then coming out, but that doesn't sound like the ideal path for me and I'd never be able to share that part of my life with anyone. 
I don't know. I feel like I'll never be truly happy unless I know for sure and can confidently be myself. I'm not sure how to get there without messing with other people's emotions or worrying about outing myself to the people around me. I just need some peace of mind. I can't live like this forever."

"How can I (F) help my boyfriend with his sexuality, anal play and using his sex toys",Puzzleheaded-Gene369,ainbow,"Okay so here's some background: me and my boyfriend of 8 months are both bisexual. He has had sexual experience with men previously.  My boyfriend grew up with a father that was homophobic, so it took my boyfriend a while to be accepting of his sexuality. 

We did some anal play on him early on the relationship but he sort of brushed it off, claiming it was okay but not really his thing. I didn't initiate again since I didn't think k he was that into it.

Recently, we were discussing sex toys and I asked if he'd like a sex toy, in particular a butt plug, for his birthday. He got a bit embarrassed and about 5 minutes later he asked very shyly if I'd like it if he'd used one. I said yes, as I want him to be sexually satisfied. He then confessed that he does own a butt plug. At first, I reacted irrationally. I was upset it took 8 months for him to disclose this to me. We then talked and I realised just how bad and repressed his bisexuality is. He's not fully comfortable with it and feels like anal play makes him seem wrong. He said he once used it and he felt disgusted. We talked about how men of all different sexualities can like anal play. He agreed. 

We recently had sex after this, and did some anal play which he enjoyed massively. He was making faces I'd never seen him make before! It was a massive turn on and I loved seeing him enjoy this. 

We discussed how in future we can bring in the toy.

I am very happy that we have seemed to have made progress with him feeling comfortable with him liking anal, however was looking for some advice on how I can progress this further? I am bisexual but I never grew up with homophobia or biphobia, so any tips for helping him be comfortable with that would be great too! Thanks!"
Just got perma-banned on LGBT sub for expressing my opinion on feminism. (Vent),Baka_Burger,ainbow,"I have done nothing but uplift people with my comments and upvote posts on that sub. Ive been actively spreading positivity and trying my best to support everyone.

Then I get permanently banned for, according to the admins, saying that The feminism Ive experience is very bigoted and divisive. Its comparable to something like the KKK.

I guess my experience isnt valid then. I guess having a negative opinion after having experienced something negative is a no-no. I also got called a bad person and a racist for holding that opinion. Meanwhile there are TERF and SWERF feminists in drones, as well as misandrists. But nooooo, how dare I criticize a movement for its shortcomings!

My guess is that the feminist I was having a discussion with did what many feminists do best: play the victim and silence opinions.

Im sorry, but I dont support feminism in any way, shape, or form. The bad hits of feminism are bad enough for me to just exclude the movement altogether. 

I am a supporter of humanism instead which, in my opinion, includes every good part of feminism and leaves out every bad part. Its more inclusive and humane than feminism.

There, I said it. Am I the villain for holding this opinion? I might as well lay it out there and get banned for it if thats something worth a ban, rather than keep it in and have false hopes that this sub wont be as judgmental.

And idk, if I stick around then Ill do what I do best and try to give as much positive energy as a suicidal, depressed person can."

"There is a sad lack of healthy queer spaces, especially online.",Androvaxx,ainbow,"I dont speak for everyone because Im a gay guy (cis), but apps like grindr are often very toxic where I live. It conjures images of a dark alley full of ravenous sex monsters. And thats not me feeding into the stereotype that gay men are hypersexual, its me sympathising with the fact that many queer people are starved of sexual and emotional connections with other queer folk, and so when the opportunity for sex arises, it is grasped like a man who hasnt eaten in weeks (or in our case, our whole lives).
Again, this isnt the case for everyone, but that factor i mentioned above often leads to gay spaces in real life and online being quite toxic or even dangerous. I am appreciative that app developers and small queer business owners are starting to introduce more healthy, connective spaces for gay people, but the sad fact remains: many young gay men are pulled into this environment and struggle to escape. 

I dont think theres anything wrong with casual hookups, but there are plenty of spaces for that. 

Healthy queer spaces are lacking."

He has never shown feelings for me like I have for him, which have made him draw back. We have different definitions of what a friendship is. I think our outlook can definitely be attributed to the age difference , but I also have shared special connections with him that show he is a good guy. This motivates me to want to maintain an active friendship with him. We havent had sex before now have we kissed. I go out of my way to not make him uncomfortable when we are around each other. Its so hard to make gay friends as it is. I feel like I have put so much time and energy into getting to know this guy that its really frustrating when it isnt reciprocated. Too high of expectations?

"How to put an end to the heteronormativity that exists in language, in technology for instance?",Affectionate_Chair15,ainbow,"I didn't know where else to post this, couldn't find an appropriate sub where homophobes wouldn't laugh at me, so thought of posting here (please don't laugh at me). I just learned that guns and most other weapons men have invented during the long course of human history are all symbols of penises going into vaginas, that the word ""vagina"" means sheath or scabbard, and that a sheath or scabbard is a covering for a sword, blade, etc so vagina meaning sheath symbolizes vagina ""wrapping around"" a penis during straight sex.

The assignment of vagina and penis in parts of weapons is a direct analogy with straight sex.

The same is seen in technology, such as ""gendered"" connectors, pipes, etc: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_of\_connectors\_and\_fasteners#Early\_mentions\_of\_the\_metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_of_connectors_and_fasteners#Early_mentions_of_the_metaphor)

&gt;The part bearing one or more protrusions or which fits inside the other being designated ""male"", in contrast to the part containing the corresponding indentations, or fitting outside the other, being designated ""female"".  
&gt;  
&gt;In some cases (notably electrical power connectors), the gender of connectors is selected according to rigid rules, to enforce a sense of one-way directionality (e.g. a flow of power *from* one device *to* another). This gender distinction is implemented to enhance safety or ensure proper functionality by preventing unsafe or non-functional configurations from being set up.

Is there a way to call these connectors, pipes, etc different names, things other than ""male"" or ""female"" that still work in all cases like ""male"" and ""female"" do without an issue and are easy to remember?

Someone suggested a few alternative names like ""plug/socket"", ""top/bottom"", etc, but someone else said the issue is: [https://twitter.com/YouMe557/status/1305980731273785347](https://twitter.com/YouMe557/status/1305980731273785347)

&gt;those options fail to describe internal fitting/external fitting as well as male/female except maybe 'innie/outie'

Homophobes have used the heteronormative language, and the ""gendered"" connectors, pipes, etc in technology against gay people and gay sex: [https://www.lifesitenews.com/mobile/blogs/airlines-pro-lgbt-ad-reveals-the-fallacy-of-homosexual-couplings](https://www.lifesitenews.com/mobile/blogs/airlines-pro-lgbt-ad-reveals-the-fallacy-of-homosexual-couplings)

There's this question on Quora: [https://www.quora.com/If-homosexuality-is-natural-then-why-do-electrical-male-plugs-only-pair-with-female-outlets](https://www.quora.com/If-homosexuality-is-natural-then-why-do-electrical-male-plugs-only-pair-with-female-outlets)

Some have called me dramatic. To them, this isn't an issue, ""why does it matter, it's not offensive"" they say to me. But as someone that is not straight, I don't like using or hearing heteronormative language. I am discriminated against already. The heteronormative language just reminds me I am not accepted in this society. Even in language, most things symbolize or represent straight sex. Rarely, few things here and there might symbolize gay sex (I've never seen or heard of such symbolism though, just saying it might be out there and I don't know about it), but that's not the case the majority of the time.

It might not be offensive or an issue to you, but it is an issue to me. Does anyone else feel this way, or is it just me? What do we do about this? I feel like shaking after all that, I feel so lost."

List of transphobic tropes,pappyon,ainbow,"I was wondering if anyone could help me expand on this list of so-called ""reasonable concerns"", or transphobic tropes, or classic TERF talking points. I've compiled this list based on real claims I've seen online, or more often through real conversations I've had with so called gender criticals. I'm sometimes asked why I'm so keen to dismiss some of these concerns as transphobic without properly engaging with the question(s), so I'm hoping this shows those who are willing to listen that a transphobic/cisnormative outlook on the world will find fault in just about anything. I've tried not to duplicate anything, but obviously there is crossover with some.

Are there any I've missed?

**33 transphobic tropes**

1. A large number of so-called trans people are not trans, but merely mentally unwell, and they are only becoming trans because of a trans-affirmative bias/a rush to medical intervention
1. A large number of so-called trans people are not trans, but merely transvestites or autogynephiles
1. A large number of so-called trans people are not trans, but merely gay and they are only becoming trans because of homophobia
1. Because gay people are wrongly encouraged to become trans, gay people and lesbians are being erased
1. Lesbians who won't consider trans women as potential romantic partners are being accused of transphobia
1. A large number of so-called trans people are not trans, but are merely feminine boys or masculine girls
1. Because gender non conforming children are being told they are trans, traditional gender stereotypes are being reinforced
1. Because gender non conforming girls are being told they are trans, women are being erased
1. Increasing numbers of children are becoming trans because of peer pressure or societal pressure
1. Puberty blockers are unsafe, untested, experimental and irreversible
1. The medical consensus cannot be trusted because research is biased towards gender affirmative healthcare and countervailing voices are silenced
1. The new gender ideology is unsupported by science, which demonstrates that there are only two sexes: male and female
1. People who do not vocally agree with the new gender ideology face losing their jobs, social exclusion, or criminal prosecution
1. People who do not use the ""correct"" pronouns for other people face losing their jobs, social exclusion, or criminal prosecution
1. Cis womens rights to single-sex spaces are being eroded
1. If people were allowed to change their legal sex through self-identification, predatory men would use this to access women's spaces
1. Trans women have latent male tendencies towards violence and sexual assault
1. Trans inclusive policies are putting cis women at greater risk of violence and sexual assault in prisons/bathrooms
1. Cis women are unable/will be unable to compete in competitive sports because trans women or cis men pretending to be trans women will dominate in their chosen field
1. Women are being erased through trans inclusive language in private and public institutions
1. Women are being erased because public data is no longer being collected about biological women
1. Women's rights, eg. to equal pay are being undermined because data is not being collected about biological women
1. Trans women are reinforcing toxic idealised versions of womanhood
1. A large proportion of people who transition will go on to regret this and detransition
1. Detransitioners are proof that too many people are being encouraged to transition
1. Detransitioners are being forgotten/unsupported
1. Fundamental feminist notions of gender as a construct are being eroded
1. Using 'singular they' with a known referent is undermining the logic of the English language
1. Using pronouns not commonly linked to a sex assigned at birth is unduly confusing for other people
1. Anyone who raises a concern or wants to debate any of these things is immediately and unfairly written off as a transphobe
1. Trans rights activists tend to silence their critics with physical and verbal abuse
1. Trans rights activists use inflated suicide statistics to silence their critics
1. The trans lobby has undue influence on private and public institutions including the media and the education system"

https://www.reddit.com/r/nevergrewup/comments/jq2m3f/i_think_the_worst_part_of_this_disease_is/
&gt; I think the worst part of this disease is the sheer aching loneliness. There's so few people who understand and accept kids like us, that almost all the time we have no choice but to hide who we really are, from everyone. We have to lie to everyone, pretend to be what we're not, and wear a mask day in and day out. The worst part is the loneliness because whenever you make new friends or join new communities...you can't ever tell them who you really are, not unless you want to be shunned and witchhunted and bullied and banned for something out of your control. The prejudice and hatred and loneliness - that's what turns age dysphoria from something bearable, if only just - into a living nightmare.

Questioning gender identification and would appreciate any advice ,Tinytunacan24,ainbow,"Hello everyone 

I have been out as a bisexual female identifying woman (Im 27) and over the past year Ive been sitting with my relation to sexuality, gender, presentation, and relationships (monogamy and polyamory) and have recently changed my pronouns to she/they. 

I havent come out to anyone and Im scared because Im not really sure how to identify myself and what feels right. I still feel resonate with being female but for my whole life there has always been a very real male aspect to me that Ive hated myself for but last year I had an experience with a woman (not my first) but since then Ive been really embodying my masculine aspects and expressions. 

In bed with my partner (who is a male) I have these masculine feelings and physical sensations that I feel arent normalfor the binary if that makes sense. 

So, Id love any insight that you might have. Im not sure if I am genderfluid or genderqueer. The labels have definitely made it hard for me to identify where Im at but I do know for certain I am not fully a resonant female. 

Thank you all so much for your insight and support on this. This part of the LGBTQIA+ community is new to me and Im doing my best to educate myself while finally talking about something Ive been holding onto the past year."

The truth,ZesusYVNM-Fire-921,ainbow,"Still half way out.

Sup my name is my username.  Im turning 25 soon this February. I attended a college in my home town and will continue to finish my university in the coming winter. I perhaps have a lot on my plate and just needed something to open my heart out to. I dont really write about my self but I find Facebook a little to over rated to talk about feelings especially around family members.

Recently I came out to my mom (Jan.2021) biggest bomb dropped in my moms story line at least I thought so until she wrote to me in mixed words that I was not quite sure who I want to be and who I wanna see. That feeling of you could be someone better or stronger hit me in both directions. Im not openly open to close friends of mine. And I hope they never find me on here.  I dont like the idea of having an open gay friend to hang around with. But despite everything going on I find my self dating one. 

My life changed when I meet him, I was living in a room with two other roommates. Awesome people, at the time I liked to meet new people and experience new stuff. I was quite a curious guy I started going on a date app called Grindr. I meet a couple of cute guys my age. But like everyone on there there was no hop of love just lust. But this time I found a guy whos Instagram profile was attached and so I followed him on Instagram. He has no clue where I found his where about. Just a quick follow lead to a DM from him. It felt different and I continued to talk to him because he kept coming back. He is  two years younger than me. That didnt bother me and never did. There was only one problem, that I was still in the closet.

My life changed as we got together. We accomplished our little apartment which we are now moving into our own condo next month. We both have luxurious rides, Im a car ethicists and I love that about him. And well for my secret only my mom knows and my brother who I was bothered to tell because the fact that my mom wanted to be between us to was rumbling in my head. 

I only write for the 30 min breaks I have at work and hope to meet new people here while I write my story of my life along with many of my kind that are still going through this process along side of me."

Help me make an LGBTQIA+ themed quiz.,tabris,ainbow,"I've recently taken over hosting a weekly general knowledge quiz at work, and to celebrate Black History Month, I've done one themed around black history that celebrates the achievements of various people, rather than focusing on the negative aspects, like slavery and assassinations (seriously found so many BHM quizzes that solely focused on these two topics).

For context, I'm in the UK (I know our Black History Month is in October, but no one acknowledges it, so figured I'd celebrate the US one), and the office is mostly straight white cis men.

For my next quiz, I want to do one focusing on LGBTQIA+ history, and again I want to celebrate the amazing things members of the community have done. But I'm really struggling to find trivia about anything other than gay rights, AIDS, or other parts of our struggles. I want to celebrate people, not hardships.

We're all fully aware of Alan Turing, being a software engineering team, so there's little point starting there, as it has to be a somewhat challenging quiz.

Can anyone suggest some trivia of LGBTQIA+ people who have done amazing things that I can base questions on? I hate the phrase ""happens to be gay"" but it's kinda fitting for the trivia I'm looking for. I also want to avoid US specific celebrities as the team will struggle to answer a lot of those unless they're famous enough to be known over here, and again, what's the point?

For example, the black history quiz has a question on the inventor of blood banks, one  about Ella Fitzgerald, another on the book The Colour Purple, and a couple sports questions.

Any ideas?"

Do Cis people genuinely not think about or imagine about being a different gender?,Tal7550,ainbow,"I know this is old news, a tweet from October, and maybe it's already been posted about. Apologies for any duplication - I couldn't find if this has been addressed already.

But I'm just genuinely curious.... Katie Boundary writes (in a conversation with her wife):

Me to my wife: \[...\] because cis people dont think about being the other gender! \*pause\* Well, not very often, I mean.

Her: Hahaha no. Not EVER.

Me: Not...ever?

Her: Never. Not. Ever.

Me: ... Oh.

Is this actually true? Do most cis people never even think about or consider or imagine being a different gender? If one does think about these things with some frequency, and/or ever since childhood, how strongly - how definitively - is that an indicator that one is not cis? Or does it just vary and differ from one person to another?"

Some advice for the lonely gay life?,_cedarwood_,ainbow,"Hey brethren..  
  
I'm so sick of it. A guy falls for me, I'm not into him at all... I fall for a guy, and best case scenario he's upfront and say ""nah"" or ghosts. Worst case he strings me along cuz he's too chicken to express himself. Side note, it hurts A LOT more when you don't just tell people straight up.  
  
It's just hard. I try to take care of myself, right? Positive self talk. ""I'm a pretty great guy."" And I am. But it's hard facing rejection over and over, and not feeling like there's something wrong with me.  
  
Just had another guy, three months in, say what I guess I knew since about two weeks in. Except, it was more like I said it. I literally had to say to him, ""I don't think you're as into me as I am into you."" He called me sweet. I had my cry. I'll keep on trying. It's just hard sometimes. It's hard right now..

But recently, I realize that I don't know any trans men YouTubers. I don't know their experience and what the issues they go through are and any of the sort. Natalie's video talked a bit about how discrimination against trans men is different from discrimination against trans women. That left me wanting to know more.

So, TL;DR, is there any available online resource similar to the wonderful content they produce that talks about trans men? It can be a YouTube video or an article. I would honestly love to learn more."

"My fiancee is trans, Im gay, help",gaybobross0420,ainbow,"TW: sex, violently queer identities, mild kink talk, please dont attack me i am fragile and anxious

Soooooo... Im transmasculine, mostly try to live as male, and it took me a super long time to accept the fact that I'm gay. 

Met my partner a year and a half ago. We've been engaged and are getting married in April. I'm in love with this person. And a while ago, my partner came out as nonbinary. I was like, cool, me too. 

But today she told me she's a girl. 

I adore this person. Leaving is not on my mind. However, part of me is mourning, and i feel like shit because i know damn well how hard it was for her and to meet her with anything but support feels fucking evil, and i look at her and im still as in love as i always have been. But... Im gay. And polyamorous. 

Polyamory isnt a new thing between us exactly, we've talked about it before and experimented with it a bit. But we moved and started our lives over, and decided not to pursue that any further. And even when we did, it was from a wholly sexual perspective. But theres been this little desire in the back of my mind since my last relationship two years ago, and it goes a lot deeper than sexual. 

Im someone with a whole lot of love to give, and my ex had at one point brought up the idea of a triad type relationship. It was something i always craved and wanted, and my partner has made little comments and jokes about something like that, but i never really pushed it any further than that. I figured, if the right person came along, maybe itd develop naturally. That train of thought hasn't really changed, i guess. 

But this has kinda thrown me for a loop. I still adore my fiancee and i never want to hurt her. But my attraction lies primarily with men and masc/androgynous non-binary people, and it took a lot of introspection and time and self hatred to accept that. It took me a long time to be comfortable with my sexuality for fear of being seen as a straight girl, and it took me a very long time to find my pride in that. 

I love my human. I dont want to lose her. I want to be with her, I want to love her til we're both fuckin dead, but part of me wants a boyfriend too. To be loved in ways that she can't love me. She's my best friend and my life partner, but there have been parts of me that she hasnt necessarily been able to understand or embrace. This is spanning back for a long time, but I ignored it and suppressed it for a long time. 

I'm... A little.

I've never said that shit out loud, and the closest I've come was writing a letter after a fight kinda half asking her to be my daddy while explaining how I want to be loved; words of affirmation is my love language if you believe in that, and she is very much action oriented. I've learned to love and appreciate that in all it entails, but there is some part of me that longs for affection and love in the love language that i give it, in the way that makes me feel most loved. And I have spent about 19 of my 21 years with everything tainted by hell and religious abuse, so i fully consider myself robbed of a childhood altogether. So we moved to the desert to be hippies and I've been longing to regain childhood and something akin to childlike innocence, because I've been having nightmares of hell since 4 years old and suicidal since 9, and i desperately want my childhood back. And it goes further than spending my days painting rocks - its also in the way that i wanna be loved. I got to live with our friends in that type of relationship, and i was ENVIOUS. And when i gave her the letter... Well, we were different people in a more dysfunctional situation, but she told me that she cringed at that. 

And that's not her fault, shes not a boy, she doesn't want that role in my life, okay. But as someone with a lot of trauma, mostly caused by his father, i really crave that almost paternal sort of love alongside sex and romance and all that shit. Someone to take me out of my head for a bit, to give me what was robbed of me all my life. Someone who lets me be little. Up until she came out to me, i was trying to work up the nerve to bring it up again, but now I know that I can't ask or expect that of her. 

It feels selfish to think about it. But i want her involved too, don't get me wrong. I want someone that loves both of us, wants both of us. And i know in relation to sex, she's been wanting someone that can top her better than i can. I dont know, maybe im fishing for justifications in why i suddenly feel so overwhelmed with this desire now. 

Her coming out wasnt the reason, but i guess the final thing that made me actively want anything. 

And its stupid and purely hypothetical at this point. There's no one else right now that im even interested in, and i dont even know how a relationship naturally develops (most of my relationships have been long distance and online, and i met my fiancee on tinder). I have people flirt with me, and where i live, polyamory is the norm, but im so anxious and shy, i still only have a small handful of friends, none of which i could see anything developing with. I dont even know how i would broach the subject without hurting her. 

Its turned into a long and rambling vent post and i really have no clue what im even asking beyond advice. Desperate, desperate advice. 

TLDR: my fiancee told me she was trans today, im a trans boy and gay, and polyamorous, and a little, which is something that she's never really embraced. We've been in an open relationship in the past, but I think I want a triad type relationship because i dont want to part with my gay identity and because i really crave love in certain ways that she can't really give me, but still want and adore and love her, and would love for her to experience the little uptick of love too, if she wants it. Its not anything i want to bring up immediately but I am having a lot of very sad and conflicting feelings and feel like a total dick hole, please help"

I've been trying to imagine me with a man in a  sexual and romanticly way and dont seems good to me like its almost desgusting(sex) repulgnatn, so maybe my men's crushs were really something or just ""oh he's' fine and he is giving me attencion when no other man did before""(maybe i wanted a man friend and not a bf?) does any one had this thougts or feeling?

Living with HIV,thefentydoll,ainbow,"I was diagnosed HIV positive in September 2020. My entire world felt like it was over. I cried every single night to bed wondering why me? I struggled to disclose with anyone because I was so embarrassed. I couldnt confide in anyone because I felt like it was my fault for not practicing safe sex. Prior to being diagnosed I was engaging in lots sexual activities, with drugs and alcohol. The fault was mine and I had to own up to that. It was the hardest part of my journey. Deep down I was still very angry at myself. For not being safer. For not being precautious. For not taking the right measures prior to engaging in sexual activity. I couldnt be mad at myself forever so I sought out to change. I deleted every single dating app I was on. I decided that I would be content being alone. I cut off everyone whom I engaged with sexually. I opened up to my best friend and she took it well and consoled me. I felt safer. I felt okay. Being unaware of whom exactly gave me the virus was eating at me. I kept analyzing and replaying the year prior in mind to see if I can catch the source of it. I later realized that was a waste of time. The source wasnt important anymore. I took part in risky sexual activity and I needed to be responsible for my actions. I later came to realization that I had a negative viewpoint about people with HIV. My viewpoint of it was very ignorant. I started to unlearn the negative connotations I put on people with HIV. I learned that no matter high or low life will take you dont judge anyone. We are not inevitable to anything. These past couple months have changed my whole life. I navigate differently. I dont pass judgement on anyone for their actions. After unlearning my ignorant behavior, it was easier to start loving myself. I grew a different type of love for myself. I love myself for who I am. I am very lucky to be alive and I am very thankful to be alive. I still havent disclosed this information with my family because their not entitled to that. I am no longer ashamed. I feel at ease with myself. I love myself and Im praying for growth and peace on my little journey called life."

This is despite the Travelers website claiming (an update they had me make, no less) that they have guidelines in place to help transitioning employees and to create a positive environment: [https://imgur.com/XFCLbYx](https://imgur.com/XFCLbYx)

My appreciation for the beauty of women.,That_Smol_Bean,ainbow,"The human form is at its best in females. Even in the strongest, most powerful women, they hold a certain tenderness in their bodies that cultivated what it is like to be human. Since the beginning of time, women have been honored in art in a way amen never could be. The masculine sculptures always emit an egotistical aura, even in the most emotional of pieces. For those artists who can capture the gentleness of man, kudos. Those pieces are truly beautiful. However, rah woman is a walking magnum opus of Gods design. She is an individual capable of complex emotions. Being of excellence and grace. Computer of intellect and wit. Vessel for new life. Through her pain, we continue building humanity. The face of a woman is a unique portrait. Every face so sharp and soft in the perfect places. Her body is soft and round, with arms and legs to attach to her loved one. Her breasts are mounds of cushion that soothe the warrior and helpless babe. Even a woman with desert skin feels soft under the layers of clothing that keep them warm. Women are beautiful creatures tempting sirens. I am proud, yet ashamed, to admit I love them."

Not so happy coming out stories? Alas, we need them, too.

Creepy Encounters? Ugh, tell us anyway!

Live in/lived in or visited London?! We want Drag Queen saviours. We want stories that will make us cringe. We want recounts thatd make us wretch. We want gossip thatd drop our jaws. We want the cutest stories thatd make us 1% jealous, 99% happy for you. 

We want to hear whats made you sob, cackle, scream. We want to know when youve felt unsafe and what you did. We want to know what empowered you!

Did you have a brutal break-up which turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to you? Or did you meet someone that you thought was a dream come true but turned out to be the opposite? 

We want to know everything from when youve felt discriminated against to how was your first kiss, first time, first sauna? Have you gone to a party which did not end the way it started? How did you find your happiness?

Ultimately, we want to reflect the LGBTQQIAAP community in as real a light as possible, but also play with the ideas in a fresh new way. The good, the bad. The veneer, the heart, the glitter and lights as well as the darkness and difficulty. 

Whether youre on the scene or not, whether your story is dramatic, quirky or quaint  we want it! Nothing is too gross, too sweet, too heart-breaking, too delicate. We will listen, we will respect, and we will create!

We will offer complete anonymity if you prefer, or we can go ahead and plaster your finest headshot along with the story so you can use it as a conversation starter, or a bit o attention down the line. The story is yours, the choice is yours  were just gonna funnel it into a cool new format. And seriously, we have a lot of ideas to really let these stories and these projects shine.

If you have a story you want to send us, please email a quick summary of up to 500 words to: theinsecureunicornteam@gmail.com, or just send us a DM  we arent fussy! (Social Media tags below)

We will be reading over them together, and sorting through them before selecting a collection. Dont think its not worth sending something, it is  we have a tonne of eclectic ideas of how to get these stories out there, so theres a very high chance you will be featured in some way or other!

If selected, we will get back to you so we can get the full story, and we will be sure to green light any final piece with you, so fret not about us twisting it.

Dont worry, well be including our own, so were in this together... so, come on. Get them in! Spill the tea, as it were. Confide in us. Lets make 2021 that bit gayer, that bit more creative!

Love,
The Insecure Unicorn Team. Xoxo

I'm cis and I've become obsessed with trans rights. What do I do?,pappyon,ainbow,"Six years ago I was, at most, mildly curious about trans rights, although it wasn't an issue I understood at all well. To my shame, I'm sure I ocassionally made crass, flippant remarks about ""men becoming women"" for instance. While I believed it could happen, I wasn't above making stupid jokes. 

Fastforward to now and I'm thinking about trans rights almost non-stop, and have been for months if not years. I now know that trans women are women, 100%. And while I can obviously understand that not everyone sees it that way (yet), I'm continually shocked and disgusted at the level of blatant transphobia, and arguments based on unexamined transphobic assumptions, that I see on TV, print media and the Internet. Like, just now I've found out there's a group calling for the elimination of ""transgenderism"" ([source](https://twitter.com/KatyMontgomerie/status/1353427385379680256)). They might be a fringe group, but they are connected to other groups who have the ear of senior government ministers.

I'm not trans, I don't know any trans people, and, arguably, there are other issues in the world that are far more deserving of my attention, in the sense that they impact upon a greater number of people. But I just can't get the whole toxic ""debate"" out of my head. 

I think there are a few things that might explain why.... 

* I live in the UK, and over the past five years the environment for trans people here has become increasingly hostile. This was started, ironically, by government proposals to introduce progressive reforms to the Gender Recognition Act. But this sparked a massive backlash across online and traditional media. [This twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1347457964320452608.html) does a great job at outlining the awful history here.

* At around the same time, conversations with my largely gender-critical friends, often parroting now-familiar TERF tropes (eg. trans people exacerbate gender stereotypes, won't anyone think of the children etc. etc.), caused me to realise just how toxic and ridiculous the trans-sceptic side of the debate had become among left-leaning, otherwise progressive people. On the back of this, I became more interested in, and passionate about these issues, just as the media and celebrity backlash was really starting to ramp up. 

* I started to drift away from Reddit and onto Twitter just as JKR began having her ""middle-aged moments"" on Twitter. I started following more trans rights-focused twitter accounts, mainly to make sure I knew what was going on, because the UK press certainly weren't reporting on it fairly if at all.

* So now transphobia is trending on Twitter on a near-daily basis, and in the mainstream news weekly. In response, my Twitter feed is full of people defending trans rights and debunking the transphobic myths in the news reports (eg. [this from the Times today](https://twitter.com/benjamincohen/status/1353274050722869249)). 

* I find the website impossible to get off. It's like a car crash that I can't turn away from. Arguments that I see, or ocassionally get involved in, with my friends or with people online, play in my head constantly. I'm just ceaselessly amazed by the stupidity and mean-spiriitedness of it all. I don't want to ignore what's going on and I don't want to be silent about it either. I don't want to let the transphobia go unchallenged. At the same time though, it's taking up a lot of mental and emotional energy and I don't really know how to stop that.

So I don't really know what the point of this post is, and I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but I just wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience to me, and if anyone can help explain, or at least relate to what's going on here. I think I also wanted to ask, is it weird for a straight cis man to have this level of interest in trans rights? Is it helpful or harmful to LGBT people?"

Ive meet this one guy for a hook up. But we hit it off and stayed like the whole talking. Yes we did kinda hook up but we also were very romantic with each other. We even talked about deep stuff and cried. He told me from the get go he has his walls up and dont want no relationship with a man due to his culture and he knows a future with a man is impossible. Weve met the second time 2 days later and slept together. Again we talked about more deep stuff and he cried to me again. During the evening I saw he had grindr. I got super Jealous and he saw that. He opened grindr and showed me that he doesnt really reply to people and deleted his account and the app in front of me. When I complimented him he wasnt really comfortable he said he never had that before. On our 3 meeting we just hanged around and I told asked him again. I asked him what did you thought when I told you I liked you? and he said  I didnt really care  and  that I regret opening up to you bc I dont want people to know much about me. So he wants so be friends and we still follow each other on social media. Yes yall can say he is an asshole forget it etc etc. but what do yall think? Did he like me? Is he putting up a front to not like me more? Or did he never care about me? What should I do?"

"Sex seems like a whole lot of exertion for minor pleasure, is it even worth it?",CreakeyBroomwood,ainbow,"I'm not Asexual (or nonsexual), least I don't think so currently and I'm not exactly Apasexual either.  

To be honest I have never really had a pinpoint of my sexuality.  Which is rather odd because I've clearly had 'interest' I guess in both guys and girls plus I surprisingly own a lot of gay media, so I'm clearly not straight...Yet I'm no closer to knowing my sexuality.

The best way to describe how I feel about sex, is probably how I responded to a friend who considered themselves asexual at the time on if I'd mind if we ever got together.

&gt; Honestly sex really isn't a major focus for me, I'd be fine dating someone who has no interest in sex.  It would just be rather nice being with someone I feel comfortable with really plus I've always got my hand after all.

It isn't like I've never thought about sex or that I don't get aroused but fiction is harmless while actual sex seems like a whole lot of exertion for minor pleasure, is it even worth it?"
Homophobia as a swear word/insult to people,Dreadpirate45,ainbow,"I think its very disrespectful and thoughtless to throw around homophobic as a way to attack an individual. For starters, people with arachnophobia have an irrational fear of spiders. Sometimes it is such, that they can see a doctor and still not be able to get rid of it. Its not a choice, its a disease. Furthermore, I wouldnt be surprised if it is discovered that homophobia is an effect of being gay, but suppressing your true identity/hating yourself. That is to say, it is very possibly the case that homophobes are gay themselves, which if true, would mean that you are attacking the gay community when you attack homophobes. Thoughts?"

why the fuck do presidents act like edgy 13 year olds when talking about the lgbtq

in all of the above examples the like/dislike ratio is phenomenal, the comments agree with the claims and literally calls not wanting to die an""agenda"" 

these people have no empathy or sympathy for people who did nothing wrong,these people are disgusting 

africa is a conservative hellworld and the media never covers shit because it wouldnt get them money 

and no this not just lgbtq people being affected, women, internalized racism and so many others issues that no one knows about

i am 12 years old(turning 13) but i cant see these issues and not do anything i am disgusted and i can only talk about this shit on the internet because my family and friends would disregard as a triggered sjw 

men and women alike get shit for not fitting in the shitty stereotypes that the patriarchy made  

i literally cant show emotion without some jerk telling me to act like a man

no one seems to care, in fact they support it most of the time 

those who want to speak up cant because they will be imprisoned at best and killed at worst 

if i ever find my sexuality and it is anything other than straight i will probably keep it to my self and some close friends

parents here are so sexually conservative that we explore ourselves 

i lost my virginity when i was 7. 7 not a joke

i know trending hashtags dont do much but why not try?

A Friend of Dorothy (original poem) TW: Suicide mentioned at the end,MaxAtom31,ainbow,"&lt;Let me know what yall think!&gt;

A friend of Dorothy
Not by choice, but by force
Dorothy preyed on me
I felt trapped and coerced

Dorothy entered my life and refused to leave
She clung to my sleeve
She made it hard to breathe 
She was changing me

Dorothy was wrong

Their words rang out across the town 
Dorothy is a sinner, a slut, and a skank! 
She defies the word of god and spits in his face! 

These words bounced around in my head 
I tossed and turned 
I couldnt get comfortable because Dorothy was in my bed 

They say youve made your bed, now lie in it 
But what if I didnt make it? 
What if Dorothy made it and refused to go? 

She wants to cling to me for reasons unknown
Im a good christian boy whos life devote 
Devoted to god and all that is good 
I live the life I was told I should 

But Dorothy warps my reality and changes my perspective 
What if things shouldnt be the way weve always kept it? 

No! 

Shes in my head! 
Shes changing my thoughts! 
I dont want to be her! 
I just want it all to STOP!!! 

I plead for help 
I go to my father and he beats me with a belt 

I didnt choose Dorothy, she chose me! 
Yet I get punished and she goes free 

There is no escape from her 
She ruins my life and breaks my mind 

She tears me down without remorse 
But now Im done and Ill leave her for sure 

They say people are carnal 
Maybe thats why my way to escape her was cardinal 

Dorothy is gone and so am I 

My once perfect skin is now cut and torn 
The blood that leaks out has released me from my human form 

My blood serves purpose, even after death.
Dorothys once silver shoes are now stained ruby red 

The color shall serve as a reminder to be accepting so no one else ends up dead"

question/help about dysphoria?,milkkywaves,ainbow,"first of all, let me start off by saying this is in no way supposed to be offensive and i would highly appreciate if someone would comment if it does offend them so i can change it.

i have always disliked the way i look. i always projected that onto self-confidence, thinking it was something to do with my image overall. perhaps even something to do with my body, since ive previously had an ed before as well. but its so hard to describe what im feeling? i love being feminine and its something i take a lot of pride in. it makes me feel very me- but i dont like the way i look. ive never been able to look myself in the mirror and think of who i am. its almost like my personality doesnt fit my body. i also love my name. it has a very personal meaning for my family and its something that i think correlates with my personality. but i dont feel like i LOOK like my name. if someone were to guess what my name was, i know it would not be what it is. i am wondering if this is some kind of gender dysphoria and if its something i should analyze? or if i just need to find my self-identity and start displaying my personality? sorry if this makes no sense, i have no idea how to explain it...

tldr: i am a cis girl who is trying to figure out if im experiencing gender dysphoria or something else. my appearance does not make me feel like myself and i dont feel like i identify with the person looking back at me in the mirror. but i appear very feminine and ive always appreciated femininity.

disclaimer: my pronouns are she/her- i am a minor who is currently struggling with sexuality &amp; trying to become comfortable with identifying as a lesbian."

The Interventions to Reduce Stigma in Bisexual Men research exercises consist of an initial survey, then three days of online expressive writing or psychoeducation, and a follow up survey the next day and a month later. The research study asks participants to select a personal experience of biphobia that is causing lingering distress and explores healing through psychoeducation and expressive writing prompts. The interventions are at no cost to participants and can be completed at home.  It designed to be accessible for bisexual people who might find it expensive or difficult to locate other affirmative supports.

Maybe thats because they dont exist in my native language but what they mean to people is still meaningles to me. 

I know being not accepted is a terrible feeling but just because someone refered to you as he doesnt mean he is a homophobic, you should not be able to chose your pronoun. 

I dont care who you fuck with, or dont fuck at all (unless you fuck me or people under 20) but i am not gonna call you anything other than he/she/they

This got me banned from some subreddits, because i was asking same questions, about if i am really an asexual just because i mostly dont feel anything sexual but i do rarely feel something for but sexes but also thought this might be hormonal difrence, not mental since animals like bees tend to be homosexual too. Again, not saying bees dont have mental health but needed to say that.

I understand people dont want to see opinions on such sensitive topic, i got that when i was punched to ground on playground because someone i liked (same sex as me) rumored me being gay. But anyone with an opinion doesnt mean they are nessesarly homophobic.

Also, i am definitly not a homophobe, i myself dont know what gender i am, i just belive it is okay to use the pronoun right with their looks, not with their sex but how they choose to dress. I will call someone with highheels for example she or they according to their chose but i wont call them their first letter or some diffrent  just because they chose that. You can create your own language but you cant get mad when people dont speak it, i belive it is the same way with pronouns.

Also, people keep saying i should witness a gays getting married, i obiviously know it is no diffrent than straights getting married, married is something humans created, it exists because humans dont want to share their soul mate which is pretty obivious. There is litterally no diffrence in that, i dont know if i am missing something but yeah, i belive its same, not better, not truer feelings.

Also, teach me stuff i dont know instead of reporting me and making me question if being gay is a hormonal problem rather than something that should be normalized.

 I have been bullied so much both from online and real life, i am at a point to force myself a straight life and force my kid's life in the same way like a redneck idiot. I have never felt like that before, i dont belive i am straight but this idea nazis, they are creating homophobes because they want anyone who is close to straight burn.

Please help me,helpmeplease8999,ainbow,"For some background: 

I am a bi-sexual person with a tendency to like females (I am a female)  and my dads a priest (episcopal) so I am apart of the LGBTQ+ community but I don't participate a lot - because, well, *priest.* 

I am also autistic and I have BPD so I have a really hard time reading social situations. 

I'm in a group chat of people that will be attending a college I am going to next year. We have all been talking for about two-ish months. 

This is what happened: 

There is me, person X, person Y and a few other people in this group chat. Yesterday person X said that they were trans, which the whole GC accepted of course, and we went about our day. Today, person X (same person from before) sent a photo to the group chat of them injecting testosterone. Person Y asked what they were injecting into themselves and (jokingly, which I did not pick up on) asked where to get some. 

I said  ""I believe they were assigned female at birth and sometimes when you're transitioning you take certain drugs to help with the transition, and the drugs (like testosterone) shouldn't really be used recreationally but tell me if I am wrong @ person X because I could be wrong"" 

I left the GC because my dog needed to pee. No more than two minutes and I come back and everyone is really upset at me. Like really really really angry. Some of them are calling me transphobic and other people have blocked me the person that sent the photo is really upset and cursing me out. 

They said they weren't ready to tell the group yet (that they were assigned female at birth) and I feel super super super awful - like this happened at 2pm and I haven't stopped crying (its 1am) awful. 

I'm not hurt that they called me those things because maybe what I said or did was transphobic but I am so hurt that I hurt someone else, and that they are hurting because of me. 

I don't know what to do or say but moreover I am wondering *what I did* that was transphobic except for accidentally out them... obviously. (which again I feel awful about it, I assumed that they would have assumed that saying they were trans then sending a picture of testosterone people would have put 2+2 together but obviously I was very very wrong and again feel awful and like a terrible person.) I just want to learn so that I can not do it again in the future. 

I feel super awful and just want to know what I did wrong but when I reached out to other people in the GC they all were really upset at me. I also would just like a different age range point of view because most of the people in the GC are like 16-17 and I think there's one or two people who are 18."

Willing to share privately on social media about how that feels etc. some of the definitions essentially being able to be called aporagender. I think numbers two depends on some factors of which it would fall into and three for sure could fall into that category.. I think it falls into that gender experience completely and I dont identify with that experience as a stargender person.. But if someone did I'm not sure I'd consider that to be specifically stargender because of how specific the stargender experience can be vs how random and smetimes intangible an apragender experience can be... I dont think that denfinition really falls under Stargender and how it feels to genuinely feel like either an actual star in deep space, or light. But I know theres no real concensus in the trans community, that many of these gender experiences and expressions are not recognized. The otherworldly aspect to the gender experience could possibly fall into either Stargender or aporagender depending on what the persons experience and expression is..

to all the people saying this gender isn't real-

begone. you don't get to decide what someones gender is. if they wanna be male, they can be male. if they wanna be female, they can be female. if they wanna be a star, they can be a star. if they can use whatever pronouns and label they want. they can even not use a label! it doesn't affect you! so let people live their lives how THEY want to NOT YOU.

Don't be transphobic against stargender peeps.

I hate this so much. Why does the lgbtq community have to go through so much,goodmorningsatan,ainbow,"I just learned about Prep and chances of HIV even when safe and made me realise how much I hate myself for being gay.

I was watching a lgbtq show on netflix and it had a really cute gay couple on it and my closeted ass started digging into the feeling of being loved by another man so I started going on subreddits and seeing posts regarding sex/love/dating just to get a real feel of whats waiting out there for me. There I was introduced to the word PrEp  omg and I wish I remained ignorant but at the same time glad I found it. 

So even if my romantic and sexually dry self put myself out there to find love some asshole can lie to me about his status of hiv and I can still catch it. 

If I lets say hookup with a condom somehow its not enough it might break and i can still catch it. 

If i get into a monogamous exclusive relationship  MY PARTNER CAN STILL CHEAT AND I CAN CATCH IT! 

and to top it all off its so expensive that an uninsured bitch like me cant afford it or have to go through hoops to get it. 

Straight men dont have to worry about this they just fuck whoever they want then marry them. My straight friends go around fucking without any second thought all they need is a condom but I SOME HOW NEED A $1700 drug to feel love. 

I hate moves and shows how they romantasize gay relationships and how easy it is to go through life without thinking all this through. Fucking hate being gay. Gotta deal with this and my family rejecting me should just go and become a monk or get casterated."

Harmony is a Kansas tomboy, Erica is an All-American bookworm, and together theyve been the best of friends for years, but when Harmony finds that she is falling for the only person to ever accept her as she truly is she must decide if revealing her true feelings is worth the risk of losing Erica forever. When tragedy befalls them both it sets them on a course that neither expected, nor could escape.

But seeing as I've never actually experienced that with another man, how do I know if thats what I'm actually attracted to or not, and how would I go about so called ""experimenting"" if I would want it to be on the dl.

Questioning my identity rn,kg_mushroom,ainbow,"Okay so I found out I was bi in February last year and every now and then I think  about  times before that when I did bi/not straight (queer, perhaps?)  things like I had crushes on girls without knowing they were crushes (Kim possible, isa the iguana, buttercup, frickin Sam puckett- they weren't really crushes but I literally  remember getting butterflies from that blue haired girl in that group in ed edd and eddy while simultaneously simping for ace from the gangrene gang) and I liked ""boy stuff"" like I watched Ben 10 and wanted the watch instead of  wanting barbie dolls and princess  dresses. I've even had blue and purple as my favorite colors and I never liked pink (I would always say ""ew no pink is for girls, followed by a ""aren't you a girl?or you're a boy now"" followed  by a ""no I'm a girl I just don't like pink it's disgusting"")

(I also had more guy friends cuz the girls thought  I was weird for not being  a girly girl but the boys thought I was cool bc they didn't know any girls that liked Bakugan. One time my friend made me a paper plane and I was flying  it around and enjoying myself and this girl in a lower grade than me saw me and was like ""are you a boy??playing with a paper plane only boys do that"" and I felt really bad and threw the plane away)

My parents even shaved my head when I was in kindergarten and when the boys in my class called me a boy I told them to stop but I secretly was okay with it lol. Almost  a year after knowing and accepting that I'm  bi I'm  now wondering  if I'm  non binary. I like the idea of she/they but I'm not sure. My name is Gabrielle but I don't like that name cuz it seems too feminine  for me so when everyone  in my school  mispronounces it and says ""gay-briel"" I'm not mad in fact I prefer that they call me that. My friends call me Gabby but it still doesn't sit right so  I may tell my best friend to start calling me ""Gabe"" cuz that sounds like something I could get used to lol"

However, a couple of years ago (I was about 12) I started to fantasize about girls, and even having sexual dreams about girls (and I enjoyed them, and btw now I do even MORE), but I never really thought I was bi because at that time I wouldn't even consider dating them, I was 100% convinced that I only liked boys. Years later, I have been attracted to girls in real life, but I just kept unconsciously denying it to myself. 

Today at my 17 years old, I can say that I would definitely date a girl. 

I also wanted to mention that there's this girl I've been interacting with a lot lately and I think I'm starting to feel attracted to her(?. I've caught myself smiling at my phone and get excited everytime I get a notification from her (just like it would happen with a guy) I don't know what's happening honestly. Am I confused? Am I going through a phase? Or am I bisexual? I don't even know what I am at this point. How do I know if I'm actually bisexual or just confused?

Every time or nearly every time I do this I get progressive religious people who will respond. In itself it's fine but then when I respond critically they'll rock shut or I'll just get downvotes. Another problem I have is sometimes I'll see people want to rant something out or get something off their chest about religion, request they don't get responses from religious people assuring them that they're 'not all like that' or proselytising liberal Christianity and still get those responses.

Is there some sub for anti-religious LGBTQ people to discuss our issues without religious people intruding?

I really don't want responses defending liberal religion here. I don't want to debate you here, *please* be respectful of that."

I want to tell them that she's going by ""she/her"" now but even with my mom (who *claims* to be accepting and open-minded) when I told her about the change she gave me a look like I was kidding or something!? She *actually* tried to tell me ""you know this is gonna be a problem with your dad, right?"" what the hell does she even mean by that!?

I'm going goddamn insane at the pressure being put on by my family. They tell me they just want me to be happy but if I'm not in a cishet relationship (with no sex unless it's for grandbabies, of course) they suddenly give me a look like I've disappointed them. I don't want this.  
I friggin' love my girlfriend to death, she's who showed me what love can be, she gives me hope, she makes me laugh and I just want her to be comfortable and I want her to be respected, dammit!

Looking for advice on how to counter homophobic argument,Hircus2,ainbow,"Hello,  
Yesterday I got into an argument with a friend because he was saying that society and education was creating more gay basically. I am a straight man, the few friends that were there were also all (supposedly) straight. It was hard to argue in the name of a community i'm not really familiar with (I don't know many gay people, we basically have one lesbian friend who was not there and that's it), this is why I'm asking here.
His argument was that since there was more and more gays in occidental countries, obviously there must be something creating all these homosexuals. It wasn't really his words but what I got from our argument was that he thinks the youth was getting corrupted into becoming gay.
I know this is an age old argument, my response was that there were more gay people because they were allowed to embrace who they are because we are more accepting in general. That there was and have been just as many gay people all around the world but there are some part where they are not able to express it. I was also adamant that no matter what you do, you cannot influence someone's sexuality; if you become gay when exposed to gay people, you were always gay. Also another dude was talking about if you have relationship with women but would be gay if you found out about gay people you're still straight as long as you don't act on it (not his words really but what I got from it), I said that if you're attracted to the same sex you are gay (or bi) whether you act on it or not.  
This is what I had, but the dude came prepared and had examples and supposed studies. He named a sociologist that claimed that most gay people have often a social circle that is mainly composed of other gay people, which meant that they were influenced by their circles. I just said that it's not surprising that someone who is gay would feel more comfortable around people like them. He also cited Freud for I don't really remember what argument and I just said that freud was very dated psychology and you can't take all his word for truth.  
Basically, he had ""studies"" to back his argument, and tried to make it a debate; while I only had common sense and observation. In the end since I could absolutely not hear what he was saying, or agree to disagree (because it was in my opinion absolute nonsense that had hatred rooted in it), I seemed kind of like a dick  who thinks he can't be wrong. I believed I couldn't be wrong about this because it is not up to debate it is just people's feeling and experience, there is no debate to be had.  
Now since I was just reacting and honestly probably don't know much more about the lgbt community than him I might be talking out my ass. This is why i'm asking you your opinion and experience on the matter if you don't mind, and hopefully come back next time with more substance than common sense.  
Thank you, I am sorry if I'm offensive in any way in this."

Ive never felt like this,Expensive-Ad4593,ainbow,"Ive never felt like this

Ive been trying to work up the courage to post this somewhere. And after last night Im ready to snap. 

I am the sole caregiver of my father. He is in extremely poor health and Im all he has. Before the pandemic I was doing just fine. I was able to pay all the bills and make sure he had to food to eat. I didnt and still do not care about me, hes all that matters. Covid hit, I lost my job. In some sort of sick joke the universe pulled on me, he lost his health care because I didnt re-enroll him but I never received the letter they swear they sent telling me I had to and why I had to. Now I have to pay for his medications. I was able to pull myself some work, so I stopped getting my own medications and started getting his. As I said, screw me he is the important one. Now I have no work until the last week in January. I apparently had to apply for the stimulus check and I didnt know that so I dont get that. My dad opened the fridge this morning and looked at me with such disappointment. Im failing him. Ive reached out to community resources, neighbors, and programs. When I couldnt get any help or immediate help from them I finally called his sister. His sister is a vile human. When their parents were dying in hospice she somehow managed to switch everything over to her. And all my dad wanted was the vintage car him and his dad refurbished together. She didnt even give him that. She told me that my father isnt worth it and that I should just let him go and live your life. Do yourself the favor. No one will ever make money caring for another. I then asked if I could do any work at all for her and she replied with an extremely nasty remark and hung up laughing at me. She doesnt hire gays. I am bi-sexual and literally came out right before I was handed the title as my dads care giver. My father is very supportive of it but any family we did have has written us off. 

I am supposed to be the man of the house. I am supposed to be the one handling everything. I have the landlord and electricity down my throat. Ive had so many extensions. I tried just expressing how I felt to others and was mocked because men dont talk about this stuff dude. How do I tell my dad that the only person who would help wont because Im not straight?"

"I'll never understand gay conservatives (TW: homophobia, transphobia, mentions of hate speech)",CantDecideANam3,ainbow,"For a while, the Republican party bashed gay people (even if they were conservative) and said that they shouldn't be allowed to marry, and while some members of their party still do hate them, they literally claim the left is bad for their movement even though the left was the ones who helped give them rights in the first place. Unsurprisingly, just like straight conservatives, when they face the consequences of violating the terms of service, they claim that their ""free speech"" is under attack. No, they also spoke out against certain groups of people (including themselves) and their subreddits have had hate posts specifically against trans people which I will talk about in the next paragraph.

Of all the things gay conservatives have said about trans rights, all of them were against it. Not a single gay conservative is pro-trans. They promote this idea of ""separating the T from LGB"" which they claim means that ""sexuality and gender are different"", but in actuality, they hate trans people and want nothing to do with them. If you want to support the LGBT community, you have to support ALL the letters, not just some. My guess is that they've been bullied by their own party for so long that when they finally moved on to hating trans people, they took their anger out on us. They blame the decline in LGBT acceptance on trans people when the real reason is because of the rise of the far-right.

If there are other problems that you have with them that I forgot to mention, let me know."

TW: HATE SPEECH. Professor telling students that gayshave lower life expectancy from complications related to anal sex (hearsay),Weirdguy85,ainbow,"I heard this from a friend o mine who was told this directly.  So, yeah, its hearsay. Take it with a grain o salt. But I want to get to the bottom o this (no pun intended) and insure hate speech doesnt go unchecked...

A professor allegedly told theology majors (future pastors) that gays have lower life expectancy from complications related to anal sex. Something about the rectum or something being inverted or prolapsed (cant remember the word)

As far as Im concerned this is hate speech. But I dont know how to corner this professor (and former dean or school or theology) to question him to whether he said this or not. I need to scheme and strategize a way to get him to admit it, then get him some consequences... hopefully.

Any ideas? I would love to confront him face-to-face... but my job is kinda tied up w the university (former student and business owner with ties to alumni and a community that would ostracize me and sink me financially if I spoke up)... and they are all a bunch o bigots anyway and would take his side....

I was thinking an anonymous email? Ive already tried to find other students who heard him say this... no luck.... perhaps this is just bad hearsay. 

Ive also aired these rumors on student-run Instagram pages and confessionals and no action is ever inspired. Most students here are very bigoted anyway... (I wonder how they got that way? Maybe being taught to be this way from people like this prof?)

And I cant ask my friend without exposing myself. I bet he would take their side too. Loyalty.

Feel free to help me out. Im hitting a wall."

As far as I understand, sex refers to biology (male/female), and gender refers to identity (man/woman/nb, etc.), correct? If that's the case, why do I see people saying ""assigned male at birth""? Biology isn't ""assigned"", it's your observable physical characteristics


Wouldn't it be more correct to say ""biologically male, but assigned *man* at birth""?


It seems like half the time, we distinguish *hard* between sex and gender. Yet the other half of the time, we speak of sex and gender as though they're the same thing, which is very confusing. Maybe someone here can help clear it up. Thank you!"

"Came out to my wife, in a way. Still somewhat confused. Non-conformity, sexuality, label confusion, and self-acceptance",nonconform_throwaway,ainbow,"Covid lockdown has been a wild ride. Im 27M (assigned male at birth), married to a wonderful (cis) woman who Ive been with since high school. I have always self-identified and presented as a man my entire life. From the outside, things probably look about as ideal and normal as they can be, as far as societal norms go. We both have solid careers going, we have a house, we have a baby on the way, were about as fortunate and privileged as you can be at our age and I feel so lucky to be where I am in life with her by my side. I wanted to lay out this background because my story deals with societal norms and expectations, and I think this background context is an important part of where Im coming from. Now, I want to write out a sort of journey Ive recently undergone on a much more internal level, so here goes:

Starting a few years ago, I started to develop certain kinks that maybe hinted at some suppressed urges I had, but they were overall relatively tame and I didnt really think too much about them when I wasnt actively engaging in these kinks. (Really this was just limited to some light cross-dressing, wearing panties, and experimenting with penetration). I would always do these things in private, not involving my wife, because I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I had to literally force myself to admit to my wife that I ordered myself a toy because I figured shed likely see the credit card bill or find it eventually. It was so hard to admit it to her but I eventually did, and she was very neutral about it. Very much a do what you want, I dont care kind of vibe.

My wife and I have an incredible sex life, but as Im sure is true of most relationships, there are some challenges that were working through together. She has a good deal of anxiety when it comes to initiating sex, and puts pressure on herself to perform, no matter how much I tell her I just want her to feel comfortable and that I crave intimacy, not sexual gratification. When we do break through that initial barrier, our sex is passionate and incredible. I would definitely call it somewhat vanilla in the grand scheme of things, but it feels really good, and we connect with each other emotionally in a way that I know I absolutely crave. Like, in the heat of the moment, I almost start to disassociate from myself, and instead start feeling like she and I are merging into one. Its really hard to describe, but I absolutely love it, and Im mentioning it here because I want to refer back to it a little later on.

Now, let me change gears to my more private, personal sexuality. My wife works long night shifts, which means that for a couple days of the week, shes at work when Im at home alone for a good 6-8 hours before I go to sleep. On some occasions, I take advantage of this alone time to really engage in what Id call an altered sexuality. I feel differently about myself when I put on my wifes lingerie than when I do when she is around. I still identify as the same person, with the same personality, but theres a freedom to do what I want with no judgement that is thrilling. This thrill is very tightly coupled with arousal, which is why Im describing this as an altered sexuality specifically. When I finish up, without getting too graphic, I put the lingerie away, I put on my normal clothes, I go back to my usual activities and way of thinking and feeling. I liked that it could be discrete, that I could hide all of the evidence before my wife got home, and nobody had to know about this embarrassing part of my sexuality.

So this pattern continued over the course of several years. With covid, the frequency increased, since Im all locked down and working from home, but my wife is an essential worker who is still going out for her night shift job several times a week. Over the last week or so, the intensity of this sexuality felt like it increased, or maybe I was paying more attention to it, or letting it be more free or something. One evening about a week ago, while my wife was at work, I had a sudden, crazy idea - what if I just shaved my legs?. After all, its covid, nobody is going to see my uncovered legs for weeks, it sounds really exciting, why shouldnt I? I knew I obviously couldnt hide such a thing from my wife, so I texted her and said something along the lines of for some reason, I want to try shaving my legs, I dont know why but I think Im gonna do it. 

Her response was basically what I expected - similar to when I told her about ordering myself that toy, she basically said ok, do whatever you want, doesnt bother me. So, I did it. As soon as I started, I felt the same kind of thrill that I felt the very first time I ever put on panties. It was this incredible sexual excitement and arousal. This felt like the next level of this altered sexuality pattern that Ive been engaging in. The only difference was that this time, I couldnt hide all of the evidence when I was done. I couldnt just put everything away and go back to my normal self, because my legs were still shaved! I had to live with them, and the crazy thing was, I liked that idea.

I started to look at and appreciate my legs in a non-sexual context. I liked how they looked and felt, not because it made me feel naughty and sexual, but because it made me feel like me, and I could actually look at part of my body and be proud of how it looked. This definitely felt like a revelation of sorts, but it was also scary too. I didnt know what this was. Could I still call myself and think of myself as a man if I preferred my legs to be smooth and silky? What would my friends and family think of me if they found out I did this and liked it? I decided I had to do some research on reddit, since thats what Im often inclined to do when I want to know more about something new.

Now, Im still not really sure if going to reddit right away was a good idea. I stumbled across subreddits like this one and was seeing an entire world of people, terms, and ideas that I didnt understand. Ive always identified as an ally, Ive always tried very hard to stay educated and accepting of all types of people, but I admit I wasnt aware that there was so much variety and terminology. I really wanted to find a diagnosis for what I was going through. I came across some post or description of the term genderfluid and thought that maybe thats what I was dealing with. After all, the word itself sounded like it could fit since I was sort of sliding into femininity with shaving my legs. But, after deciding that maybe I was genderfluid, I read another post that described genderfluid people as non-cis, and that if you arent cis, then youre trans, by definition.

To be fully honest, this kinda terrified me. I dont want to be trans, it doesnt feel right to think of myself in that way. I think trans people are incredible, I think theyre some of the bravest, most courageous people on this planet, but I cant think of myself in that group, or with that label. I know about other trans people who have described the trans experience, and I just dont connect with what theyve described at all. I dont suffer from dysphoria, Ive never wanted different pronouns or a different name than the masculine ones I use today, I dont want to be a wife instead of a husband -- I am excited to be a father and a dad. But, Im such a sucker for definitions and diagnosis that I thought well shit, if liking my shaved legs makes me genderfluid, and being genderfluid makes me trans, then I guess thats what I am even if it feels wrong to think of myself in that way.

Another day or two went by and I was still grappling with this stuff in my mind. My wife, meanwhile, knew about the shaven legs, seemed totally fine with it, if not super excited by it. I started to work on a letter, in the mornings when she was still sleeping, because I knew that no matter what I was going through, I wanted to find a way to tell her. I wanted her help in figuring out what this was. So I worked on this letter over two different mornings, basically going over everything in this post so far, including my self-diagnosis of being genderfluid and the fact that this might mean Im trans, even if I didnt want to be.

My wife went to work another night shift. I distracted myself from the internal gender identity crisis I was going through by letting myself fall into that altered sexuality mindset again. Instead of worrying about labels and diagnosis, I was once again focused on loving my body and the thrill of my new legs. I reshaved them to get rid of the stubble, and felt a sudden urge to paint my toenails. I decided to just do it, throwing caution to the wind. When I was finished, I of course loved how my feet looked, they looked pretty and sexy to me, and since Im so unaccustomed to thinking of myself as being attractive at all, this felt like even more evidence that yep, I guess I really am genderfluid. So, while my wife was at work, I sent her the letter, telling her that if she had some downtime, I wanted her to read it and let me know what she thought. 

I think the letter kind of scared her. My usage of the label trans in the letter definitely made her uncomfortable, and I think she interpreted the letter as evidence that I might want to become a woman at some point in the future. She said that she was confused and couldnt really tell what I wanted. She told me she was really worried that I would someday want to change myself with hormones, or change my body with implants, or change my voice, and that idea made her afraid, I think because doing those things would change who I am to her and of course thats a scary idea. She wants to be in love with me for the rest of my life, she knows that she is in love with who I am right now, but what if she fell out of love if I completely changed as a person? I totally get it, and I know Id grapple with the same type of struggle if the roles were reversed and she decided she wanted to transition to being a man. 

Anyways, her overall reaction to the letter definitely gave me a confusing mixture of feelings. On one hand, she seemed totally fine with me having a feminine side. She was excited to help me paint my nails, or try different hairstyles, or eventually do some girly things together after covid like a spa day. That part of her reaction is awesome, and validating, and great. 

But on the other hand, she was definitely hung up about my self-diagnosis of genderfluid. I dont know if she fully believes me when I say that I dont want to become a woman, possibly because I was okay with using the term trans in my letter even if I didnt feel that I can identify with it. 

I think the part that makes me feel a little bit bad about her reaction to my coming out letter is that now I have this lingering feeling, like, ok she might accept me for who I am today, but what if she ends up being right? What if 10 years from now I decide that I do need to transition or something? And what if I were to do that and she wasnt able to completely accept me? I think she would try her absolute hardest but at the end of the day, it would be such a massive change in both of our lives that I wouldnt blame her for not being able to do it. I try to tell myself that this is a silly line of thought though, that I shouldnt worry about a version of myself that doesnt currently exist. But its hard to completely ignore that tiny bit of worry. 

I think this is maybe a problem with trying to grab labels, terms, and definitions as diagnoses, especially so early into the process of questioning who or what you are. Im not as educated as I can be on these issues, and neither is my wife. I feel like I had enough knowledge and awareness of gender issues to support that community as a cis straight man, but now that Im questioning my cis-ness (and to be honest, also my straightness), it feels pretty overwhelming to try to find a label that matches my mindset, especially when that mindset is evolving and changing day by day. 

So anyways, back to the story: The next day, while my wife was asleep, I did a bit more reading, and came across a term I hadnt seen before. This term was gender non-conforming, and it immediately resonated with me, I think because it seemed to describe actions instead of identity. Me shaving my legs is 100% a non-conforming action to take as a cis-man, and I know that I liked taking that action. I knew that I wanted to do more things that are non-conforming in the future, with my wife, and it felt right to want those things. I feel like identifying with this label gave me the freedom to want these new things without changing who I am fundamentally. I think this is what I thought gender fluidity was, but now that I have some understanding of both labels, I like gender non-conforming a lot more.

It also gives me a feeling of empowerment: gender roles suck, Ive always thought so (and so does my wife). By refusing to conform with some traditional aspects of masculinity, Im demonstrating my displeasure with these societal roles, and I like how that feels.

When my wife woke up, we talked a lot more, and I think this conversation made us both feel better. I showed her what I read about gender non-conforming, and she agreed that that term made her feel more comfortable too. At the very least, it gives me something to think about myself that doesnt scare me or my wife at all, which creates the freedom I need to explore this more.

We had sex that night, and it was incredible to get to feel open about myself. I took on a more submissive role than I ever have before, I unashamedly rubbed my smooth legs against hers, and kept thinking about how sexy my feet looked. It was incredible, and I also realized that the entire time, I wasnt worried about whether I was having sex as a man or as a woman. I was having sex as myself, fully and without any filter. If my body wanted to assume a submissive, feminine pose, I let it. If my body wanted to moan or make noises, I let it. If I wanted to grab her and switch to a more masculine position, I did so. It was a freedom I had only ever felt in my private, altered sexuality sessions, but this time it was with the person I love and I wasnt ashamed at all.

Remember way earlier when I mentioned feeling like my wife and I were almost merging into one entity when our sex was really good? In a way, I almost feel like this is happening on a broader, more permanent level. By freeing myself of all worry about my role and expectation based on my gender, it feels like Im closer to her now than I ever have been, both sexually and non-sexually. 

For example, since shaving my legs, Ive started to dislike a lot of my super masculine boxer-style underwear, and I asked my wife to help me shop for some new ones. I found a website that sells underwear purely by style and not by men/women categories, and it was such a great feeling to shop with my wife in a completely genderless mindset. We ended up each getting something with the same style (just different sizes), and it was somehow such a good feeling that she and I werent categorizing ourselves differently. I also picked out a thong for myself and just the fact that she was sitting there with me, helping me pick it out was so reassuring and affirming. 

Ive learned so much about myself over the last week, and I know that I still have more self-discovery ahead of me. I wanted to share this because writing it all out helps me reflect on it, but also because I think theres something to be said for the danger of reaching for labels and diagnosis, especially so early into a questioning phase. When I finally let go of finding the perfect label or perfect term, and just focused on doing what I want to do, regardless of what that might define me as, I started finally feeling happy and able to share my full self with my wife.

Some day, I think itd be awesome if I could build up the courage to show off this feminine side of me more publicly. But for now, especially when this is so new and different, Im perfectly content to just be myself around my wife. I love her so much and Im so glad I opened up to her. If you made it all the way through this, wow, thank you so much for taking the time to read about my experience.

And while letting go of labels and terms was helpful for me to keep exploring myself, if I said anything that is incorrect, or problematic in any way, especially about the terms and labels I described, please let me know! (Especially if I accidentally said anything that could be transphobic). Im always looking to broaden my understanding of myself and other people. If anyone reads this story and feels like there actually is a term that fits very close to what Ive described, I definitely would love to hear it. If anything, knowing which topics and labels I should read more about will only improve my understanding, as long as Im not so eager to immediately apply them to myself. In general, I still feel like Im actively questioning who I am, so if you feel like you have some insight after reading this, please do share it. Thank you so much!"

"Don't settle for ""soft queerphobes""",DaveGr0hl,ainbow,"One of the biggest things I've learned this year is that just because everyone is necessarily ""okay"" with your queer identity doesn't mean they're worth having as a friend. 

In the wake of a really toxic friendship this year as well as a home environment that forced me to foreclose upon my Queer identity (as opposed to simply being gay), I resolved that I wanted to be more upfront, and I guess, ""aggressively"" Queer. I'm fortunate enough to have a friend group mostly made up of other Queers or (actual) allies, but I also had a few friends who were in the sort of ""edgy Joe Rogan centrist"" camp. Think the kind of people who were saying ""I don't know why they can't just peacefully protest"" in the wake of George Floyd.

One of these people, and the one from this group I was probably the closest with, had recently had a string of....shall we say distasteful takes on certain political issues affecting me. The straw that broke the camel's back regarding this was when, in a discussion with members of this part of my friend group about ""alienating Trump voters"", I said that, as a Gay man, I don't feel comfortable around anyone who voted for Trump in 2020, knowing full well his record on issues such as my human rights. 

It was then that this friend told me that ""You won't get people to hear you if you keep shunning them"", and then proceeded to bring up that Black guy that converted KKK members as if it was *my* responsibility to be like him. Given the fact that I had dialoged with people wearing shirts from a neo-nazi streetwear brand (which is, apparently, a thing) as well as a member of the Hell's Angels at my job, I was none too pleased with this take, and resolved to talk to this friend about it when I felt comfortable.

While the talk itself was eventful, but resolved nicely, the next day I found myself removed by this person on most every platform we communicated on. When I inquired about why this was, I was told that, apparently, I got mad because they were just ""trying to help"" - lecturing me on why it's ""my responsibility"" to dialog with people who want to kill me is, helping, apparently.

It was a few days after this in which I found this person making transphobic remarks in another group, as well as misrepresenting what happened in our conversation in an effort to keep their own face, at which point I informed the (non queerphobic) members of our friend group that this happened, which ended up with someone else leaking this to this person. What ensued was the person who showed my ex-friend that we were aware making numerous baseless attacks against my character, resulting in me, in a blaze of panic, apologizing to the person who made these shitty hot takes - for what reason I did so, I'm still not entirely sure.

Because I'm not sorry.

I'm not sorry for being proactive about my right to exist. I'm not sorry for no longer wanting to associate with people who, if given the chance, would stand idly by while me and my other queer friends are hauled off to camps or jailed. I'm not sorry for expecting my friends to respect *my* experiences as I have done theirs for so long. That doesn't make me an asshole - it makes anyone who would become righteously indignant to the point where they would stop being friends with me after *years* of friendship because I put my foot down about these things an asshole, even if they don't realize it. And it doesn't make the person reading this an asshole for wanting the same thing.

If there's one thing I want to impart on you, the reader, it's this: Just because someone isn't outwardly Queerphobic in any form doesn't mean they're worth being friends with. In these trying times for our community, regardless of the (narrow) results of one election, we owe it to ourselves as Queer people to expect our friends - be they Queer themselves or allies - to defend each other in times where we are under attack. If someone isn't willing to defend your right to exist in the face of those who want to murder you, then can you really call them a friend?"

My mom gave me what I consider to be ""a girl's name"". In written correspondence, I've been referred using female words. Never bugged me.

I don't want to refer to someone else something that offends them. But it won't be authentic to my own wishes if I tell people how to refer to meit will be a lie to say that it matters, and to me, putting pronouns in your profiles says that, although, realistically, you're mostly doing it to support non-passing trans people, there's also an element of it mattering to you personally.

\[I'm with Tom\]([https://youtu.be/46ehrFk-gLk?t=30](https://youtu.be/46ehrFk-gLk?t=30)). I think it's archaic that we have a language system that still incorporates gendered pronouns outside of subcultures. But this garbage is unlikely to die off before I do. What's correct behavior for me?"

Any advice for a FTM still in the closet in a very transphobic area?,trans_throwaway2,ainbow,"Howdy, this is a throwaway account, partly because if this got tracked back to me, it would be the end of all communication with my family as I know it, and also because I didn't even have a Reddit account before this, being just a lurker on popular subreddits and not really contributing. 

Apologies for any incorrect terminology I might use, as I'm very ignorant of LGBT as a whole despite being one, due to a homophobic community and low access to resources.

I am, as the title suggests, a teen who identifies as a he/him, as a FTM transgender. I live in the butt end of no where, also known as rural southern United States, miles from the nearest town. I go to a small school, and everyone there is the definition of redneck. They eat, breathe, and shit discrete homophobia along side blatant transphobia. You'll often hear people using transgender folk as the punchline of jokes, or making a side comment about how much they hate homosexuals, and overall everyone here has the thoughts that LGBT+ folk are 'messed up in the head'. 

These people include my family. Both distant and close. My dad is more open to LGBT than most people, seeing no issues with homosexuals and any sort of sexuality, but anything other than birth gender is where he draws the line, and will often talk about how unnatural and weird trans people are. I've attempted to test both of my parents position on transgenders by mentioning a transgender discord friend, and my mom voiced even more hate for the transgenders than my dad, forcing me to block my friend. That made me extremely upset, as they were around one of the only people I had really ever connected with enough to mention my dysphoria, and the time after that was rough.

Here comes in me, a transgender male in the middle of all of this. I haven't told a single soul in my friend group about it even though I know they would support me, as I'm afraid of what would happen if one of them accidently had something slip to someone else. Despite being teenagers, or rather, *because* we're teenagers, most people in our grade are stupid assholes who would no doubt have the exact same dispositions of their parents, and would out me. 

I don't want to come out of the closet, as doing it myself in any sense would be near impossible, as with my current age I'm not well enough off to live independently, and the only other option would be to go to whatever conversion therapy my religious homophobic parents decide would be best. The state laws are very harsh on runaways, so staying at a friend's house wouldn't be an option either, unless there are protections for LGBT+ teens I don't know about in Texas.

**TL;DR**: I live in a place where as a transgender, coming out or talking to anyone about my gender would put me in immediate danger.

I'm not really looking for any specific advice here, I'm just looking for any help. Even just the assurance that I'm not alone. I lost my only line to the LGBT community, the discord friend, in a stupid test of my parent's tolerance.

I don't want to be told to come out or something yet, as that would be a total nuclear option that would completely change my life for the worst. I just want something, anything really, that would at least make me not feel like utter shit every waking hour."

I am deeply confused,matty95duh,ainbow,"I am a 17 year old girl, and I don't really know what is wrong with me. For years I have been deeply confused with myself. I worry that I am a lesbian, but at the same time I am not even at all sure if I am one. My sexuality is incredibly elusive. One minute I feel incredibly sure about it, and the next I am just deeply confused again. I have had crushes on boys(at least I think I have), but I am not sure. The first crush I ever had was on a boy when I was 7 years old. I clearly remember feeling nervous and thinking he was cute. I went on to have crushes on 3 more boys(these where all in elementary and early middle school). But, by the 7th grade I no longer had crushes on any boys. I began to have these very intense crushes on girl, totally unlike anything that I have had with boys. With boys I thought they were cute, and I would feel nervous around them. But, with girls it's entirely different. My freshman year of high school was the first time that I felt the urge to actually kiss someone, and they where a girl. But, I get incredibly uncomfortable also. If I like a girl I just stop talking to them, and avoid them. Every time I feel guilty, and strange. 

But, even stranger I feel like I could be happy with a man. The idea of having sex with either a woman or man makes me disgusted, so with this in mind I would much rather just be with a man and be ""normal"". This entire thing is hard to explain anyways, because I barely understand it myself. Sex repulses me most of the time, but sometimes it does not. Sometimes I can watch porn(straight and lesbian) and actually find it appealing, but I could never imagine myself doing those acts. But, most of the time I am intensely repulsed by sex in general. It's to the point where I just can't understand how people want that. It becomes almost obsessive because I think of every little detail. I constantly think about sex, but not because I want to have sex. Instead its about how gross I find it to be. The thought of something going inside of my body, just no. It makes me so disgusted. Maybe I am just a prude? And then with lesbian sex, sometimes I don't find it all that disgusting, but other days I think it's the most disgusting thing in the world, the same as straight sex. 

What I do know is that I have a stronger romantic attraction to women then men. I am not romantically attracted to men, but I am also not sexually attracted to either, except for a few random moments. Could I just be a lesbian in denial?"

Now, I can't speak to how the trans reddit community behaves but on twitter there is a non negligible sum of trans/trans activists people who are toxic and straight up unhinged. That is my opinion. Perhaps there is not alot of individuals on trans twitter, I do not know the data but they sure are loud sometimes. A couple recent examples I can point out the is response to Elon Musk's tweet and a #startcisshaming twitter movement that popped up in my feed.

Elon Musk recently tweeted out saying pronouns are an aesthetic nightmare. I agree with him to a certain degree. Having a ton of pronouns and expecting people to learn them is rather bold. I don't expect people to learn my greatest passions, what identifies me. That's just my opinion, plz don't hurt me. However, Imo it's hypocritical of him seeing as he named his son XAEa12 or sum shit I forgot. 

Well following that tweet he got alot of responses telling him to go fuck himself, go to hell, mock his rocket test failures, insult his intelligence and just generally take the topic of discussion completely away from gender identity and pronouns. This is extremely counterproductive and delejitimizes the transgender community's mission of spreading awareness of transphobia and fighting for better treatment.  

Also, I recently noticed a #startcisshaming tag go around twitter. The premise has 2 fronts from what I gather. 1 being that the tag is just a joke from the trans community and front 2 is that the tag is essentially a punching bag for bullied trans people to use in order to vent their frustrations. I don't have a huge problem with the substance of the tag. My issue is the hypocrisy of the matter. Had I, as a cis person started a #starttransshaming tag I would be demonized and utterly lit up. Rightly so too. Shaming anyone is not cool. 

What am I getting at... I'm kinda rambling. I just think that some of the more vocal members of the trans community who resort to shouting and insults over logic and reason should reconsider their methodology so as to not look like the very same people they are fighting against. 

P.S Please note that I really hope I did not offend anyone with this post!! I honestly wish nobody harm. I cannot stress this enough.

They are defects, even nature hates them or we would have way more gay people than what, barely 10% of the population. That should be obvious"". I didn't tell her I'm lesbian after that. But what do you think, is straight the default sexuality? Are we abnormal? Is nature against us?

I am also attracted to females only.

So, maybe you could help me with defining myself? I don't feel that it's fair to call myself trans because I see the pain trans people usually feel when not in their comfortable form."

I'd be a good way for us to maybe swing more moderate people, and well as get some exclus to come to our side if we're lucky

I think a debate sub would be useful is because it would provide a safe space for inclus and exclus that *want* to talk to each other can do so with out the social pressure to be mean to the other side. I've actually felt bad for not immediately being mean to exclus before. A weird thing to feel bad about I know, but it still happens occasionally.

People who are in support of BIPOC issues but completely ignore issues surrounding the LGBTQIA+ community. People who support feminism, but won't support women's rights in nations not in the west. I've always felt that you need to understand the intersectionality of the issues and how they are all interconnected and related. To the point where if you ignore an issue, you are not supporting any issue. That either you support the marginalised as a whole or none of them. Of course, people can have issues that they focus on over others. Hell, my own focus is trans rights as well as female reproductive rights. But it's important to understand how these issues intersect all other issues surrounding it.

Harassed for a Year,PrestigiousBread3458,ainbow,"I want to thank everyone for their support, but I'm going to have to leave Reddit because I've been harassed for a year by a guy named Peter Cooper from Berkshire, UK. After I started questioning my sexuality last year over a female professor (I'm F), Peter created a libelous post accusing me of stalking her in retirement and made fun of my anxiety disorder in this same post and the comment section (which was pretty ironic considering that he supposedly suffers from severe anxiety himself). He would then follow me from sub to sub to taunt and provoke me, and I obviously had to delete that account. He then followed me onto two more accounts (this being the third) and continues harassing me and sharing his SRD post. I have reported him to Reddit admins. several times, but they allow him to continue.

I even called his police back in April, when he was still living in Sheffield UK, and they warned him to stop harassing me, but he then used the warning as a further source of harassment, bragging about ""having the police called on him over a SRD post."" When his harassment continued months past the warning, I reported him again, but because of the international nature of the situation, they wouldn't prosecute him. (Had I lived in the UK, he probably would have been charged with malicious communications and harassment.) I reported him to my local police as well, but cyber harassment isn't taken seriously in the US.

I'm sure that he will show up here either on his main account (thestickystickman) or on one of his alts. (Asticky\_, DovahzulsABadConlag, notpeternotpete, Paintings\_of\_Fawns, or one of him many others) to share the post or harass me some more. He's clearly never going to stop, enjoys harassing a complete stranger, and loves the attention he receives from it. So the only way I can (hopefully) escape him is to stop using social media altogether. It's not worth the stress anymore, but I'm going to miss this community."

Crowdsourced insight: How would you describe my sexuality?,RobinWhose,ainbow,"Hi everyone, I'm a genderqueer (cis-male, gender-non-conforming, crossdresser) guy who's embraced his queerness only in the past few years and I'm still wondering how best to describe my sexuality. Not because it's super important to have a single label, but just because it does come up and because language reflects thought, so I'd like to be as clear as possible about who I am (for my sake as much as others).

The long description: I'm definitely not 100% hetero. I am primarily attracted to women, but there are definitely men I'm attracted to. It's not close to an even split though - I live in LA and in a given day, I might see dozens of women I'm attracted to but maybe one guy, if that (at least pre-pandemic, right now I see my living room couch). The ratio is maybe 50:1 or even 100:1 women:men that I find attractive. I'll say, if it was even 10:1 I'd call myself Bi, but the split as it is, Bi doesn't seem to fit (at least to me).

On the Kinsey Scale, I'm something like a 1.5.

Also, my attraction isn't the same for each gender. One of the best models I've seen for romantic attraction splits it into three parts Physical Attraction (i.e., naked fun time), Emotional Attraction (i.e., wanting to share, care for them, be cared for), and Social Attraction (wanting to 'be a couple'). In other words, wanting to screw, wanting to cuddle and talk about feelings, wanting to sit on the couch and watch Netflix or go on dates.

I have all three of those with women. With men, it's really just physical.

One final wrinkle is that my sexuality is tied somewhat to my gender identity and expression. When I 'see myself' with men it's much more often with me presenting femme. It's not always that way, but definitely more so. My crossdressing is separate from my sexuality and my sexuality separate from my feminine gender expression - but there's definitely some overlap in the Venn Diagram there.

So, of the poll options, which seems to you to most fit what I'm describing? Thanks in advance. :D

&gt;01. Denial of your sexual orientation to yourself and others.

&gt;02. Attempts to alter or change your sexual your orientation.

&gt;03. Feeling you are never good enough.

&gt;04. Engaging in obsessive thinking and/or compulsive behaviours.

&gt;06. Low self esteem, negative body image.

&gt;07. Contempt for the more open or obvious members of the LGBT community.

&gt;08. Contempt for those at earlier stages of the coming out process.

&gt;09. Denial that homophobia, heterosexism, transphobia, biphobia or sexism are serious social problems.

&gt;10. Contempt for those that are not like ourselves or contempt for those who seem like ourselves. Sometimes distancing by engaging in homophobic behaviours  ridicule, harassment, verbal or physical attacks on other LGBT people.

&gt;11. Projection of prejudice onto another target group.

&gt;12. Becoming psychologically abused or abusive or remaining in an abusive relationship.

&gt;13. Attempts to pass as heterosexual, sometimes marrying someone of the other sex to gain social approval or in hope of being cured.

&gt;14. Increased fear and withdrawal from friend and relatives.

&gt;15. Shame or depression; defensiveness; anger or bitterness.

&gt;16. School truancy or dropping out of school. Also, work place absenteeism or reduced productivity.

&gt;17. Continual self-monitoring of ones behaviours, mannerisms, beliefs, and ideas.

&gt;18. Clowning as a way of acting out societys negative stereotypes.

&gt;19. Mistrust and destructive criticism of LGBT community leaders.

&gt;20. Reluctance to be around or have concern for children for fear of being seen as a paedophile.

&gt;21. Conflicts with the law.

&gt;22. Unsafe sexual practices and other destructive risk-taking behaviours-including risk for HIV and other STIs.

&gt;23. Separating sex and love, or fear of intimacy. Sometimes low or lack of sexual drive or celibacy.

&gt;24. Substance abuse, including drink and drugs.

&gt;25. Thinking about suicide, attempting suicide, death by suicide.

&gt;In their book, Pink Therapy, Davies &amp; Neal (1996) illustrate some examples of how internalised homophobia and oppression may affect gay and bisexual men. Some of these examples include:

&gt;Fear of discovery:

&gt;where a person may try to hide his sexual orientation from family, friends, work colleagues, etc, by passing as straight. He may also pass to protect others, i.e. pretending that his partner with whom he lives with is just a good mate.

&gt;Discomfort with other gay people:

&gt;men who prefer not to socialise on the gay scene for fear that they will be seen going to/from those venues despite being comfortable going to gay bars when abroad on holiday, or the man who chooses not to speak to another gay man at work because he is a bit camp and people may put two and two together.

&gt;Heterophobia:

&gt;putting down or even avoiding heterosexuals is an example of reverse discrimination from some gay and bisexual people to heterosexual people.

&gt;Feeling superior to heterosexuals:

&gt;the idea that gay people are better than heterosexuals. Examples include attitudes such as gay men have a better dress sense than straight men or gay men are better listeners than straight men.

&gt;Being attracted to unavailable people:

&gt;an example may be a gay man who happens to be in love with a friend whos straight. When this pattern of being attracted to unavailable men is repeated over and over, it may be the result of internalised homophobia.

&gt;Short-term relationships:

&gt;an example could be the person who works long hours, has a hectic lifestyle, and when a partner wants to get to know you that bit more, you may decide that your life is too busy for a relationship and that you want to keep things simple.

&gt;Internalised homophobia and oppression can have a huge impact on your mental health, as well as influence your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.

&gt;Davies &amp; Neal believe that it is virtually impossible for any gay or bisexual man who has grown up in the UK or Ireland not to have internalised societys negative messages about homosexuality."

Co-worker (CW): cis male, gay, and very active in his local LGBTQ community.

Me: Interesting, I use them in mine. Why do you think it's dumb?

CW: It's a false show of solidarity. My friends who are trans don't like it and it doesn't help anyone in practice.

Is it okay to unironically dislike or even hate cis/straight people as a whole?,DtheAussieBoye,ainbow,"(Posted this to r/AskLGBT a few days ago, but I felt it would fit here too. If anyone knows any other subreddits where this question could be appropriate for answering, let me know. Also, while I wanna hear from everyone, Im particularly interested in the answers of those who make cis/straight jokes of any magnitude.)

Now granted Im LGBT+ myself- a bi dude. I understand that a lot of the cishet bad! stuff is a joke, most people being lighthearted with it. However now I feel like Im being told another thing- that they need to be just jokes without truth behind them. I always saw those jokes on Tumblr and Twitter and stuff as vents, with truth behind them- maybe they didnt mean it 100% but they definitely dont like cishets. And now Im being told that actually disliking them as a whole is bad? Despite all the stuff in the past, plus everyone seems to find it fun fun to watch insecure cishets getting angry about them. I wanna do that stuff too, but i just dont know how far I can go. 

Am I allowed to be angry at them for all the past stuff or not? Can I take the piss out of them, even meaning it? And is there such a thing as going too far? I feel like I havent got a substantial answer. Im sorry if this question is dumb, and I can always delete it. I just need guidance."
I think that it's perfectly valid if someone wants to identify as a different race or ethnicity. We have things like ''catgender'' and ''pupgender'' now - where people's gender is literally a dog or a cat. Identifying as a different race isn't too different from identifying as a different species.,stacybuttercups,ainbow,"I don't believe we should gate-keep who can identify as what. Everyone should have the freedom to identify as whatever they want. As of December 2020 we have things like catgender, pupgender, frostgender, Pichugender, stargender (all of them have articles on the LGBTQA wikia) etc.

Oxford has updated its definition of gender to now mean it's simply just what you identify as. Your gender is a cat? Fine, you're a cat. Your gender is a class C star in outer space? That's great, you're a star. Your gender is Japanese or Irish? That's perfectly valid, as well.

People identifying as a different race is fine, if it makes them happy to identify as a different race I don't see why we should give them abuse over it. Identifying as Japanese isn't really different from identifying as a cat (catgender) or a star (stargender).

If someone has an identity, and it has the suffix 'gender' at the end - that is their gender identity and you cannot change that. It is also transphobic if you harass anyone over their gender identity. If someone says they're (idk) ''Japangender'' and they identify as a Japanese person, you should respect their identity. If you don't respect it then you're literally being trans phobic and prejudiced"

Coming out trans - fears for family,playingpoodles,ainbow,"Hi all, I was assigned male at birth, but from my early teens I felt very strong urges to dress as a female, and take on what society considers feminine roles.  Even as a young child, I demanded to have a pink ribbon in my hair like my sisters, and played with dollies as they did.  

But I have alwasy publically suppressed my desire to express myself and dress as I wanted, it never felt safe to dress feminine in public.  But at this point, I consider myself a gender fluid person primarily attracted to women.  I have a good friend and she and I have had intimacy over many years, but she is currently living in her country, and I am in Australia.

Taking meds and surgery are something I considered and decided would not be a good fit for me, but I would like to be free to dress and act as I want in public.  I would like to permanently transition to female dress at home and out in public.  I would also like to wear nice feminine boots and shoes with low heels, and also use some lovely pretty bags.  I have often worn all pink in the past, and people just thought I was a gay man, and I never had a negative experience with that. 

But I am worried for my family, partiuclarly my nine year old daughter, because I do not know if I will be subjected to open abuse here in Australia if I start presenting as female in public.

I have some questions and I would like to hear your thoughts:

1. Will I be judged both in the LGBTQ+ community or in public if I identify as gender fluid presenting female without using hormones or surgery, but wearing clothing society stereotypes as female?   Will my relationship with my girlfriend be judged?  Will people mock me if I identify our relationship as lesbian - I don't think it is any of their business, what the nature of my sexual relationship with my girlfriend will be or how we choose to define it.

2. If I dress fully in women's clothes publically will haraassment from strangers in public here in Australia be a real thing?  If it will happen, will it be just abusive words, or could we expect even physical aggression?  You understand I am not just worried for myself, but for my daughter.

3. Would people think or even say or falsely report to some authority that I am a bad parent or abusive to my child because they will think I am a 'freak' for dressing as I want and therefore that I should not be having custody of a child as a single parent? 

4. Will adults mistreat my child because they think I am a 'freak'?  I am not worried at her school, as we know them well, and there is mutual trust.  But I am thinking at things like sports and choir or other activities kids do when they are left in the care and supervision of adults I don't know but where parents aren't allowed to stay for the activity.  I am worried if there are people hateful enough out there to think they can abuse a child because their parent is a 'freak' and therefore the child deserves it?  I know I might be over thinking things, but those who are parents will understand that that is our job also.

Thank you for your feedback!"

being confused is not poggers. help.,Bread_Banana,ainbow,"
ive posted this to like a million lgbt subs bcuz im annoying and im not gonna wait for answers any more. im honestly sick of waiting to figure out who tf i am.

at this point fuck it yknow. idc if anyone ik irl finds my acc. i want advice, and i dont have real friends so imma make a reddit post about it. cope.

im just so confused. ofc ive questioned my sexuality, doesnt everyone? im a girl. i know i like guys, i find them attractive and would def want to date them. im just rly confused on whether or not im actually attracted to girls

like idk bro. do i just think theyre hot and absolutely beautiful and gorgeous bcuz i want to be like them? or is it something more? cuz i genuinely cant tell.

on top of that, i have this friend. i suppose ex friend now bcuz im a jerk and i cut her off but thats a whole different story. shes straight. shes been my closest friend for years, and ive been wondering if i caught feelings for her or smthn. shes just so beautiful and kind and just thinking about how amazing she is overwhelms me with emotion, idk what emotion tho, just some emotion. idk if its platonic or romantic attraction, or maybe just obsession. i just love being around her and she makes me so happy. could i imagine dating her? i mean im 15 and i cant imagine dating anyone, but i kind of feel like i would want to date her. idk i just want to hold her hand and kiss her ok or do i even want to do that i just aofunekshfndo idk

and then theres this girl i saw on the internet. just some random tiktoker. idk, shes beautiful. shes so cute but also gorgeous but also hot. my heart literally fluttered the first time i saw her on my for you page. ahhh idk tho just bcuz i think someone is hot doesnt mean i would date them tho, which is why im confused

my dreams are always very weird and random and dont make sense and the plot changes like a million times throughout the night. sometimes i just have these dreams that make my heart heavy. i cant stop thinking about them and i long for them to be real. the whole reason im making this post is because after questioning myself for so long this was kind of the last straw. i dont know its kinda weird ig i just had a dream with this girl who we just i dont even know we just were talking and walking around this huge building looking for something and we were being mean to eachother and we didnt like eachother at all but she just kissed me and i dont know i kinda just fell apart. i just cant stop thinking about it and my heart just idk i just want that to happen again. thats why im writing this absolutely ridiculous post

ofc theres just random celebrities and characters too yknow. ive only had one crush on a real boy my entire life, and then one other crush if it even is a crush idk on the friend i mentioned earlier. i have fictional crushes on men, and there are some female fictional characters that i like but idk if its a crush or just wanting to be them.

i know this post is super stupid and dumb and its like im probably not bi im just a straight person that wants to be quirky and cool and so i think saying im bisexual is gonna get me attention. like i know im probably just doing it for attention but theres still a part of me that thinks its something real. 

so just, tell me. please. im genuinely a wreck over this. i just need an answer. like this is probably nothing for someone to use to figure out my sexuality i just need some advice maybe. how do you tell if its attraction or wanting to be someone? how do you tell of its a crush or not? do you think im bi? sorry for wasting your time ik im prob straight im sorry but if you have read this far please consider answering."

"How can someone be a ""non-binary lesbian""?",breast__croissant,ainbow,"This is a genuine question, I just really wanna understand how this works, because correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the definition of lesbian 'a woman (cis or trans) that is attracted to women (cis or trans)? So in that case how is someone who doesn't identify as a woman remain as a lesbian?"

"Gays: what would the future of healthcare be like, look like, and feel like if it were designed for gays by gays?",AcceptableDrama,ainbow,"I've had a slew of terrible experiences seeing the doctor and it turns out that I'm not the only one. Curious to get your thoughts on positive and negative experiences with healthcare, the patient visit, and doctor interactions, specifically:

What do you love about your care experience today and what do you hate?

What is meh-but-tolerable and what must change, like yesterday?

If you could wave a magic wand and design your own care experience from the waiting room to the procedure room, what would it look like and how would it make you feel?

What topics did you wish you could talk about with your doctor but were too embarrassed to ask?"
One year ago I found myself,dtrachael,ainbow,"It's just past one year since I accepted that I am transgender. I had been wondering for a while. I knew that there was something not right but I couldn't understand what.

One night I decided to try an online gender checker. I was well aware that these are not reliable and are best avoided. However I was totally unprepared for the elation that I felt when the result was Pangender. However elation turned to disappointment a couple of weeks later when another test result said that I was Cisgender. Enough said about these online checks. The only thing that I can take from that experience is confirmation that these tests are unreliable and not to be trusted.

I then decided to start educating myself about gender and transgender issues. Reddit was a big help together with other online sources. I soon realised how ignorant I was with regard to gender, sex, sexual orientation and in particular transgender issues. Now I feel that I am better, although not fully, informed. However I'm sad to say that this can't be said of the public in general whom, In my opinion, are poorly informed.

By now I was accepting, although not admitting, that I was transgender and becoming a little more comfortable with myself but I was still not sure where I was within the gender spectrum. At that time I was still thinking that I was pangender.

Around six months prior to this I had become aware of dissatisfaction with my body and decided to diet in order to satisfy my wish to improve my body shape. I have always been fit, take regular exercise and run usually 3 times a week. Prior to my diet my weight was 142 pounds which for a 5 foot 5 inch small framed person is no doubt good. However for me It was not the look that I was yearning for. I wanted to have a more feminine shape and have a female looking face. Although at that time I did have very small man boobs I wanted to have small but proper female breasts . I started to research how I could achieve this goal and eventually came to the conclusion that HRT was required. By this time it was early 2020 and Covid was starting to hit our shores. This together with not wanting to approach my doctor meant that I was going down the DIY route. My records of when I started HRT is a bit sketchy but I know that I was on testosterone blockers and estrogen come March this year although I think that it was earlier. It took a bit of adjusting but I now think that I have the dosage right and I'm satisfied with the results and feeling fine. I would have preferred to have gone down the route of getting HRT via my doctor but I did not see this as being viable given my timing. I'm a great believer of the National Health Service here in the UK but hearing of a two year plus wait for a referral to my local gender identity clinic this was not an option. If I was 29 years or younger I might have considered it but being the wrong side of that a two year plus wait meant that it was not up for debate. I accept that there are risks, as there is with everything we do in life, but the alternatives could be worse.

One thing that I have enjoyed is getting my presentation correct. I now consider myself as being NonbinaryAgenderfluid and try to present Androgynously. Changes to presentation are in the main subtle. Previously I would be seen wearing jeans, polo shirts and sweaters. I would get my hair cut in a gents barbers to a traditional short style. I would always be clean shaven as I naturally have very little facial hair. Nowadays my male jeans have made way for female size skinny fit jeans, for no other reason than that they fit me better and I feel more comfortable wearing them. I also have a couple of pairs of leggings although I'm yet to wear them outside any further than the bin store. My polo shirts have all been ditched and replaced with t-shirts in both female and male sizes and style depending on which fits me best. I have kept some of my sweaters but have added a couple sweatshirts and hoodies. These have been in male sizes but I wouldn't hesitate to buy these in female sizes if the fit was better. My male sleepwear has been replaced with female sleepwear as I was feeling distress regarding the cut and style of male sleepwear. Nothing sexy but more of a plain comfortable style and look. Male underwear has all been replaced with bikini style female underwear which is again relatively plain but comfortable. My breasts aren't large enough that I need to wear a bra unless I have a tight fitting top that shows my breasts and nipples. For this I have some bralettes but prefer not to wear them. One thing that hasn't changed is my footwear which consists of my old running trainers which are androgynous in appearance. I do have a few female tops, skirts and one dress for the times when my gender fluidity moves heavily to the female side although I haven't worn the skirts or dress outside. Perhaps this may happen one day but for now I'm happy with my androgynous look. My short hair is now long and cut in an asymmetrical style at a unisex stylists and I get it coloured, currently it's a mid brown shade. I previously hated going to the barbers but now I really enjoy the experience at the salon. I have changed my skin care routine and regularly cleans and moisturise my face during the day. Although I have little facial hair I shave every day and this is a must before I go outdoors. I don't have much in the way of body hair but I now shave my entire body at least once a month. I am conscious of me being dysphoric towards body hair. I've been experimenting with makeup but have some way to go before I get it good enough to be comfortable going out with full facial makeup although I feel that I'm almost there with foundation and lip gloss.

I've not had much of an issue with dysphoria but, although in general I like my breast growth, there has been times when I have taken a dislike to them. Most of the time I accept my male genitalia but there are occasions that I take a total dislike to them. I've had occasions when I got negative feelings but thankfully these occasions have been rare and I've always recovered from them satisfactorily.

Many past events in my life now make sense to me. I first tried female clothes at about the age of 14. This is something that I thought all 14 year old boys did. I don't know if this is the case or not but now it makes more sense to me as to why I did it. Since my late teens I've had dreams where I am a girl and I've often had feelings of wishing that I was born a girl. These are events and feelings that I'm not particularly proud of but I can't deny them or think that they will be eradicated.

Its been quite a year for me. Its been a massive learning curve and that aspect has much further to go. I feel that I am a better person and much more understanding of others. I feel really good with myself and where I am with my journey in life.

I wonder where I go from here. I'm thinking that I should perhaps take a little break and fine tune before continuing my journey. I would like to come out to family and friends but I am frightened of the reaction that I might get. I have briefly discussed gender with one close friend but only to the point of saying that I don't relate to gender as being male and female and that people to me are just people. This was merely an attempt to gauge reaction and went reasonably well.

One thing I'm sure of is that I have much further to go and my journey will continue but for now I'm content, happy and in acceptance of being transgender."

Or if I like women more like say a 60/40 split does that not count as bisexual. When talking with people they said that if Im attracted to people that are transsexual than that means Im pan. Of course a transsexual man or women is just a man or women so Im attracted to them as well. So does that mean Im pan? Ive also heard people say you can be both and I dont really understand that. Im sorry if this question is dumb. I cant talk to anyone in my family about this and the friends I have that I can talk to about it are just as lost as me. So Ive been very confused lately. I just recently allowed myself to accept that Im apart of this community and that I have sexual and romantic feelings towards men (though Ive known it most of my life).

I am going through a lot.,PatrickH5A,ainbow,"So to be friendly let me say hello. I am still a little new to reddit. I stream now on reddit. I used to stream on Instagram TV well that was just a mess. I am Gay. I have DID which is a bit of a hassle because it seems to cause more troubles than any other things. You would not think being single and 54 and lonely would have been a thing. you would not think being somewhat looking at and upvoting and commenting under the influence's of some of my Alters would be seen as Huge No No's You wouldn't know that these events would lead you to be called a slur. a Tranny Chaser.  What on earth would make anyone ever think that its okay to go there and say that. No its Okay to not give a person reasonable chance to explain. not that it matters anyway. your labeled now and now everyone in the communities will forever know you as that ""Pervert"" your now the Pariah. Without anyone knowing a singular thing about you. What is said must be law? so now I am wondering as a Gay man who went through a lot in my life been scared to come out when i was told I would die and go to hell. And when I did Manage to gain the Courage to come out. Nearly lost my family. Oh I nearly forgot to mention I was raped twice by the same guy, at the same school. that i wrote the coming out letter from. this was years separated yet still the Irony right? The Rape well in the early 90's in Texas let us just say was not a band marching event. You could not go and walk in tell the University Police and they went and got their person. They Laughed at me they called me names made fun of me told me to get the hello out of the station warned me to never come back with any other such nonsense like that again. Was I not a Big Boy! A Real Man would have fought his Attacker! A Real Man does not Get Raped! Men Do not Have Sex with other Men! But Wait! when is it ever okay for anyone of us to attack another one of us. maybe it did not happen Directly Here, but when you go anywhere even a Discord where when one asks to join they are turned down banned and why. Tranny Chaser! Wow! Really! Imagine if you are able that is. that at childhood your life is shattered and you don't even know it that you are now Multiple Personalities. and that no one in your life knows this either, that it will take many many years,

when you do find out its a revelation. and you begin the journey of Merging and trying to gain more of your memories and other things lost. what if during this your haunted with doubts fed by your Alters who are not the same gender choice as you the Host? you go down a rabbit hole. you finally get that taken care of after much pain.  Women can be very cruel wanting money and things from a Disabled Man. Then you reach an agreement with your Alters they can look at pictures vote and even comment within reason. but then these rouge Alters begin to go to far. So You begin a long and arduous task of Merging. This process takes time. its not a Magic Trick. I am done now. but it would have been nice to have had some support. There is Zero Support for anyone like me. When I go to the Local Bars and Clubs all they See is an 54 yr old man! And no one wants to be near nor even look at a 54 yr old man!  So even here its the Same no one wants to talk to or get to know a 54 yr old man! No one wants to Date a 54yr old man because its gross! Your a Perv your a Tranny Chaser Your a Pedophile! Your a This or That! Omg You have DID what kind of Sickness do you have. In the Clubs when they find out that you have no money at all then they really want nothing to do with you. You are useless! 

So Tell me again why is the LGBTQ Et Al Community which has done nothing but shun me from the beginning before there was a reddit or social media. Why Should I even care? Because Damn it! Your Supposed to be my People! Your Supposed to be My Kin!  If no one else in this earth gets me then Your Supposed To!!! No Not Once Not Ever! Not in My Local Community! Not in any Social Communities Not Once! Not on any Platforms!  I live with my Two Best Gay Married Friends. They have been the only ones who have loved me taken care of me accepted me. and yes that is so great. But that is not enough right. 

I may have Alters but I am alone, its not right twenty plus years and not one single date. I take care of my Best Friends Husband since he got sick two years ago from sepsis! he has legs that attach to his knees. but he does not walk much his hands have attachments that go over what were once his fingers he never uses those. While my Best Friend works I take care of my Brother In Law who is my Roommate also. I make him breakfast  I make his lunch. I help with everything else he cannot do. 

So again its okay to call me these Names right? to not let me on a Server because of somethings I voted for that were not even really me. I get it. I get hassled by the Straights enough as it is. It Stings and Hurts more when its my Own People.

I am making some decisions [Coming out],geographical_penis,ainbow,"Hello to all people. Back in August, I thought myself to be nonbinary. Except I always enjoyed feminine things, and my thought process was always ""Fuck gender roles!"" Except a little bit ago, I was thinking ""what if I was actually female instead?"" And recently, I've discovered that I don't feel 100% comfortable with any of the terms/pronouns, except if I had to choose one, it would be female. Except a transition is still up in the air for me, I am still not 100% comfortable with the idea of one, except I am getting more comfortable with the idea of one. I am wanting to more and more, yet my masculinity and deep vocals for a 14 year old make me feel less comfortable with she/her pronouns and transitioning. But I got so much support from my friends that know about this, and now I feel much more comfortable with it. I do know that physicality doesn't matter as long as you're comfortable, but I do feel insecure about my body because I've always hated how hairy and masculine and male-looking I am, since I am in a male body. But I think I have an idea-

I want to be a she/her, and I will try it out for a couple of days. My name is no longer Nate/Nathan, it is Nat. (Such as Natalie, but I like Nat better). I only have one person who can call me something else, and that name is just a nickname that honestly sounds male or female. Other than him, everybody else, my name is Nat

I just felt like saying something about it, get rid of some of the fear and insecurities. Thank you all for reading this :D"

I am a hetero cis woman and I have several questions,TheDudeOnHisRug,ainbow,"1. I have a trans friend and sometimes I mispronounce the nouns, especially when I am taking about her in third person. She came out rather late and I have known her since I am am 4,so I sometimes switch back, mostly when I speak about them in third person and I always feel terrible and its never intentional. This never happens when I talk about a trans person I just met... 
How do you feel when someone mispronounces your gender? Do you feel bad, even when you know it wasn't intentional? Does it still hurt?


2. Doed anybody has a good article/sources about beeing transgender? I want to learn more and need good sources. Amongst other things I want to explain properly to other persons the views of trans people( mostly trans because this was the topic I received the most non understanding).
Friends were on one sinde understanding towards the trans person I am speaking of.. But on the other side still like: ""but whyyy? I really can't understand that."" And I want to give a proper response on that. For me it does not matter why... It should not matter at all.. But I think a little explanation could helped with getting a better perspective."

"How to respond to homophobes who say that gay relationships are a ""disgrace"", that the depiction of them in media ""gradually corrupts media and society"" and that those who enjoy the media depicting gay relationships are ""mentally ill""?",Affectionate_Chair15,ainbow,"A homophobe left a comment underneath this website sharing a series which depicted a gay relationship. This is a screenshot I got of it: [https://imgur.com/WNwb3KK](https://imgur.com/WNwb3KK)

It was originally in my own native language, but it was easier to use the ""translate this page"" option for you to understand it as well. Though the translator was incapable of comprehending everything, it got the ""point"" across. 

What the translator got: 

&gt;I would like to say about this series that some people want to play the role of intellectuals, for example, why do you work for the interests of others !! Sir, you are saying this, this discussion is not interesting. One time you like yellow, I am another color, but this is no longer a matter of taste. For example, someone says I like to kill people. That this series is one of the dirtiest, and the person who loves this kind of relationship is definitely a sick person, and even in other religions, it is considered very ugly, which is the normalization and disgrace of this series that makes society dirty. Someone says that other movies also have scenes, yes, other movies also have screens and they have problems in their place, but it is not a dirty launch of this series. Incest. This is my taste !!! What a ridiculous justification 

But if you can't understand anything from that, then this is my own translation of what they said: 

&gt;They say ""gay people have their own preference, leave them alone"", but being gay is not a preference just as my saying that I want to rape, or commit any other crime is not a mere preference I have. What a pathetic and ridiculous ""justification"" you have.   
&gt;  
&gt;Preference is ""I like x color"", not being gay.   
&gt;  
&gt;The depiction of gay relationships in media normalizes the atrocity which is gay relationships, and gradually corrupts media and society as a whole.   
&gt;  
&gt;Gay people are mentally ill, and those who enjoy watching anything that depicts gay relationships are clearly sick in the head. Even other religions view gay relationships as an abomination which should be avoided at all costs. 

What do you think? How would you respond to such a person?"

Seeking friendship advice,thellama285,ainbow,"Its funny Ive been debating for sometime whether or not to post online, Im not really looking for attention but kind of feel some type of way and dont really have people to talk to so I thought maybe Id find a connection here.

Growing up in a predominantly conservative area I was able to find myself in college with the help of someone whom I had met and considered to be my best friend. A year after meeting him he got cancer and I helped him through everything, money, time, food, rooming due to his family issues, almost someone I wouldve considered family. Most people didnt like him but I looked beyond what everyone else thought because thats what good people do. Because he was sick I joined an organization at school at the time to try pass off as straight as I wasnt out yet, and wanted friends that shared similar interests as me. As time went on and we grew closer he helped me come out as he was also bisexual, eventually he went into remission and we kind of stopped talking for a few months and after getting invested I got shunned by a majority of my friends in the organization because following the rules isnt what you should do, and I ended up shutting down and my other friends stopped talking to me because I betrayed them because I didnt talk to them for a month while dealing with my own stuff. My old best friend walked back into my life a few months ago and we reconnected like old times, until he faked his death, and I have been stuck on this for months.. I have never thought anyone would actually do this but it has weighed heavily on me.. its sad that because of one person my social life has taken a nosedive, I feel like I dont really connect with anyone in the lgbtq community so Im kind of just floating on this island 

Has anyone else ever really dealt with really strange issues like this, how do you cope and grow as a person. How did you learn to trust others to make friends again after something crazy happened?

[Serious Question] Why is LGBT community so exaggerated and forced on children and other people?,Throwaway_342634,ainbow,"Throwaway for reasons like I don't want to get bullying/angry pms but I hope you will understand my point of view and we can have a calm discussion about this:

First of all I would like to claim that I do respect LGBT community and I understand that the base of it is to accept people who have attraction towards the same gender or people who feel like living as the opposite gender and etc.. My conviction is that it got so much popular over the years that it's a bit unbelievable.

My purpose of making this post is to help me understand it, since I live in a country that is very conservative and all my life I was taught not to accept people that doesn't have the ""usual"" sexual orientation, but as I see a lot of people support it and I also think that it's the right thing to do.

I was raised as a christian and obviously it's known the Bible states that ""God created woman so man shouldn't be alone"" which basically gives you the message that only male and female should be together to make a family.

We don't even have to dive into the Bible and christian principles but it's a fairly obvious fact that the love/sexual intercourse of a man and a woman will have it's result. --&gt; A child/children. And if we imagine the other ways it won't have a result. Which means that doing this is basically against nature. That is what I call fornication, since primarily making love shouldn't be done to make ourself feel better, but to make children and to populate the planet. It is literally the purpose of life and surviving. If nobody follows it humanity will become extinct.

For an example I could bring up the left-handed. Why don't we protest to accept them more? To manufacture right-hand drive vehicles for them and to allow them &amp; legalize to drive on the other side of the road as well? The answer is easy: Because it would be dangerous. There are less left-handed that right-handed so it's crystal clear that it will be harder for them to do easy tasks because always the majority wins.

I am saying that LGBT people should be accepted as much as left-handed people. Their thought is programmed in a different way that is perfectly admissible but please **do not force it** on the majority **especially on children**.

Young children's brain is still in development and they need time to decide their preferences. If we force a left-handed child to write with his/her right arm it can cause stuttering, spelling problems, reading difficulties and other terrible results that may have an impact on their life forever.

This is the same with forcing them to change their sexual orientation. They might accept it, but later they will be hesitating and they might not even make a family for the rest of their life because they won't understand/can't decide which gender they want to choose the most.

Last but not least I was taught to belive that in a family everyone has it's roles. The father does the physical work, the mother does the house related work and mostly the raising. The perfect balance is there and it was there since the age of prehistoric people. --&gt; The man went hunting because they were physically more stronger because of their anatomy and the woman remained with the children because they are more reliable and their raising thought process is more adapted to this.

So I don't get it. Why should we let gay couples adopt children? Nature obviously tells us that a man and a woman can make children so it's clear that they have the right to raise them and if we don't keep this there won't be any balance in family roles and the child won't be viable because he/she lacks the required experiences that can only be gained from the mother/father.

Keep in mind that the above mentioned reasons are all told to me by my parents, my school and basically the people in my whole enviroment when I asked what is this hate towards LGBT. I don't want to offend anyone with this post I just simply want to get counter-arguments about these fairly rational arguments.

I would love to hear your opinion and I'm also open (I want you!!!) to change my mind about all of this if you have a reasonable explanation. Thank you for reading it through!"

[Research Survey] Inclusion of Non-binary Gamers in Role-playing Games,Temporary_Alias,ainbow,"Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 4th year game design student, and I'm working on a dissertation pertaining to non-binary inclusion in role-playing games. If you're a non-binary gamer who plays RPGs, I'd really appreciate it if you could answer my survey! All respondents will remain anonymous, and all questions are optional.

The survey seeks to gather the thoughts and opinions of non-binary players of RPGs in regards to their experiences in the genre. Data collected will be used to establish the current state of non-binary inclusion in RPGs, and draw attention to what non-binary players would like to see in RPGs going forward.

I'm also hoping to conduct some short online interviews, so if you're interested in participating in that, you can leave a contact email at the end of the survey, or DM me here on Reddit! Any contact information provided will be deleted once the interview process is complete.

&amp;#x200B;

Before taking part, please ensure that you fulfill the following criteria;

* You are at least 18 years of age
* You identify as non-binary
* You are a player of RPGs

If you have any questions, feel free to DM me!

Are Sexual And Romantic Attraction Really That Different?,PrestigiousBread3458,ainbow,"As someone who has a split/sexual romantic attraction, I've also been questioning whether these are actually two sides of the same coin. (In which case I would definitely be bisexual.) They're certainly distinct in how they're initially feel. To me sexual attraction is being ""turned on"" by someone, having  sex with them, fantasizing about them sexually...well, you get the idea. But you can have all of these things, and incredible sex, and still not feel any deep attachment to the person emotionally. 

By contract, to me at least, romantic attraction is being exciting about a person, wanting frequent interactions with them, feeling like you would do anything for them or to have them in your life etc. Yet you can experience this without feeling any desire to have sex with them, at least I have. However, this is also how I started questioning my sexuality. I develop such strong romantic feelings for a woman (I'm F), that I started thinking about having sex with her. (Though since she was gay and someone I admired, I'm not sure how much of that stemmed from my admiration/wanting her approval, but it still counts as being attracted to a woman.) Conversely, I find that there's a degree of romantic attraction in sexual attraction itself, such as feeling connected to a person during/after sex. 

I happen to experience each type of attraction separately with each gender (sexual attraction with men, romantic attraction with women), but at the same time, I'm realizing that perhaps these are actually just different ways of experiencing the same feeling? Agree or Disagree?"

So they are confined to their bedroom, hiding behind a screen-name to protect their identity. And that just brings tears to my eyes every time. I think that now is an ideal time to revive this concept.

The event would be slated for fall of 2021, assuming the pandemic has subsided by then. It would be a weekend-long gathering, consisting of gender-related workshops, discussion panels, vendor booths, and seminars offering information, guidance, and support in addition to a fashion show and a dance party. There could also be extracurricular activities in the evening like sleepovers, pillow fights, movies, as well as a designated play area for guests to explore their naughtier side in private.

With sufficient interest, we could conceivably rent out an entire hotel. This would afford guests a safe-space to express themselves openly and honestly for the duration of the convention. Of course, it would also give us priority use of the restaurant, pool, fitness center, and other hotel facilities.

Before moving forward with planning, I would like to gauge people's interest in such an event and also get feedback on what everyone would like to see! So if people have any suggestions, feel free to chime in. I value everyone's input that is here in this sub, no matter how you identify."

Okay ... so let's say we are just 0.5-3% or even that gross over-estimation which is 10% of the population, what are we doing? 90% of the population are straight, give me a break. I don't want to be in this world where left and right all I see is straight people. I have no gay or bi friends, well I have no friends to begin with, that happened when I realized I barely see any non-straight around me. There's no variety. It's like going to a table and most of what you see is greasy hamburgers and that's all. 0.5 to 10% of the table is something other than greasy hamburgers.

I hate this disgusting world which is dominated by the straight people. There's no place for us, even this disgusting world is against us and is a breeding ground for straight people. When we ask for representation of gay an bisexual people in media, it's straight people acting as gay or bi people.

It's all a lie. We are so small we can't even represent ourselves in media and straight people have to do it for us. It's a joke.

And when we hate straight people for the homophobia that exists, gay and bi people use the huge number of straight people against us and threaten us, say things like ""watch it, we're just a minority. A tiny percentage, if we get on the straight people's nerves, they can squish us all and get rid of us. We would be nowhere near where we are if it weren't for straight people sympathizing with us and being our allies""

Oh thank you straight people who sympathize with us gay and bi people and then use your huge number to threaten us to not hate you, you're so super nice, you want me to kiss your feet? I would just throw up on your feet instead.

I don't care if it hurts our cause, I don't care if you allies turn into enemies, you allies yourselves are a small percentage compared to most straight people who are prejudiced against us. If you want me not to hate straight people by threatening me that they will do something to me if I hate them then I will just hate them more. I'm not going to like someone who threatens me. ""oh we are 10, you're just 1, if you don't like me I will beat the f out of you"" f off with that bs. I am going to dislike whoever I want.

You're going to say ""oh don't be prejudiced against straight people they didn't choose to be straight"" I don't care? A greasy hamburger doesn't choose to taste like garbage but I still hate it and throw it in trash. If straight people are going to hate me for hating them and if they are going to ""get rid of me"" then I will fight back to get rid of them, I will hate them more than they hate me everytime. And if I go away in the fight and lose at least I didn't submit to the people I hate. 

Yes I hate this. I don't belong to this disgusting straight world. The only reason I haven't ended it is because it's too much work to end it. I barely get out of bed anymore, that's how much I hate everything. And I'm literally crying right now as I write this."

Can People Have Two Sexual Orientations?,PrestigiousBread3458,ainbow,"I posted this r/bisexual, but I wanted to share it here as well to get as much discussion on it as possible and to hear from people of various sexual orientations. 

Someone else brought this up, but I've been thinking about it lately. People are expected to identify as a single sexual orientation, but perhaps some people have two sexual orientations? I'm not suggesting that being bisexual is being gay and straight at the same time. Bisexuals, however, usually experience sexual and romantic attraction to both genders, even if their ratio of attraction is skewed. For example, one can be 90% attracted to men and 10% attracted to women and still be bisexual, but they're sexually and romantically attracted to each gender.

I feel like I'm straight and gay at the same time because my attraction is mostly split. Personally, I like the ""bisexual"" label better, but I'm not sure if I'm actually bisexual as much as straight and gay at the same time. Similarly, if a person is equally sexually attracted to each gender but only romantically attracted to one (or vice versa), they might be bi and either gay or straight.

Must a person only have one sexual orientation? I think the main obstacle is saying you're both part and not part of the LGBT community, as well as the legal complications that come from saying you're both a minority and not a minority. However, since most people only have one orientation, identifying as two should still be considered a sexual minority. It may fit under the general ""queer"" category?

"I thought I'd be over the moon in my first orientation-aligned relationship, but the guilt is strong",chobibi,ainbow,"Could simply be a result of first relationship jitters but just over the past day or so, I've felt extreme sadness and guilt over not being straight. I burst into tears with my mother the other day over my orientation; she isn't all the way there in terms of acceptance but she is much nicer than 3 years ago. She is able to comfort me but last night I had this really severe episode where I was overcome by guilt and shame and self-hatred that I was in a terrible place mentally. I didn't tell my parents what was going on (self-hatred, despair, religious inconclusiveness, etc) but they comforted me and told me they love me. I ended up camping on their floor because I couldn't be alone with myself. 

I met this wonderful girl and she's so nice and understanding but all of a sudden, my guilt built up to a dangerous point for me. Part of it is relationship anxiety but a big part of it is the guilt and lack of stability within. I don't think I'm directly asking a question in this post but I just hope at least someone understands. I don't feel alone in feeling this, it just leaves me in such a dark place."

Guys he follows,Shinethelightnoww,ainbow,"22/ M

Hey everyone,

I want to share my insecurity that probably affects my life.

when I get to know a guy, we usually exchange our instagrams.  We have good conversations and we seem to like each other. 
When i like that person,  after check his instagram followings/followers. I get disappointed  al the time, because I look nothing like those  masculine and athletics guys he follows, and other cute guys. And they usually not only follow but also like their pics.

After that I feel that i am not his type and he is writing me because he has no other options or he thinks he likes. After that I try to shift my focus and try to cut all these feeling to him because i feel i will be hurt. 

I know that I dont need to compare myself with others because we are all different, but it happens unconsciously, we all do that when we are on instagram.

( i dont think I am ugly or whatever, i am really cute actually , but I am not that perfect as those masculine instagram models that guys follow).

How do you feel when your partner follows those super beautiful people?

What do you think? 
 Please, you dont need to calm me and say we all beautiful, just share your thoughts and experiences."

En este momento, estamos estudiando el tema de 'diversidad y diferencia', y hemos estudiado los derechos de los transgneros y los problemas que enfrentan. Yo soy gay, y me considero ser bastante consciente de que significa ser transgnero y he estudiado mucho en mi tiempo libre para que utilizar mi vox para luchar para ellos/tus en mi pas. 

A pesar de eso, cuando lo estudiamos, mi profesor a nos habl mucho sobre 'los transexuales', y nos dijo que hay una diferencia, lo que es, segn el, los transexuales no han tenido un cambio de sexo, pero los transgneros lo han tenido. En Inglaterra, ser 'transexual' no es un trmino que usamos, y por eso quera preguntar a vosotros si esto es mi profesor que no es consciente, o si esto es la realidad, porque, desde mi punto de ver, discriminar entre si has tenido una operacin me parece transfobo, porque aqu ser transgnero no significa que has tenido una operacin, ni significa que lo necesitas que hacer. 

Estara muy agradecido si pudiera ayudarme con esto, y tambin si tiene algn consejo o correccin para ayudar con mi espaol. adems, lo siento si te parezco demasiado desafilado, o insensible."
Have we solved LGBTQ issues?,Jingeasy,ainbow,"Im a white cis gay man living in the US, and I sometimes get the feeling from straight people that the US has somehow completely solved issues for gay men (relating to myself) and the LGBTQ community as a whole. I know weve made lots of progress, and I know there have been many milestones in recent history, but I have a group of straight friends who continue to imply that LGBTQ issues are resolved or are not important problems in society right now. Or that weve made it on the LGBTQ front, and LGBTQ people (specifically gay men in my case as well) dont really face discrimination. Whenever I try to bring up LGBTQ issues, I immediately am met with well you dont face XXX problem, and I see pride flags in a bunch of different places.

Now I wont deny the privilege Ive experienced because of my other identities; however, I have a lot of trauma in my past and present due to my sexuality. And I still have instances of what I feel is blatant discrimination when Im out in public. I guess I just need some validation as to whether or not Im crazy for feeling like as a society, we havent completely solved discrimination against LGBTQ people."

I feel quilty every day for something I can't control,chobibi,ainbow,"I'm attracted to girls and what I feel with my girlfriend is something I never felt with guys. It's a whole new realm. I just went to get my daily meds from my parents' room and my dad greeted me with a huge smile and wave while he was on the phone. Moments like this make me feel guilty for being unable to like guys. Last night, my mom straight up asked me why exactly I am attracted to women and that conversation started with me being unable to keep a straight face as she asked me THOSE (telling me to have a conversation with God, asking Him why I am this way, and the usual ""it just isn't natural"" statements, what is it about women that attracts me) types of questions and ended with me balling my eyes out, proclaiming that I hate myself because I can't be ""normal"". 

My parents have actually gotten a lot better about it since I came out 3 years ago when I was 15. I acknowledge and am grateful for that. They're still very rooted in the religious viewpoints of LGBT, which I totally understand; it just hurts because this very obviously isn't something I can switch off, no matter how much I may want to. I used to say I simply liked girls more than guys to prove there was some sort of parachute, that I could still end up with a guy and not sin or whatever. But I've known for some time now that I just can't be with a guy. I don't feel any romantic connection to them at all. I just don't. As for the other things I feel guilty about, I think about how my brothers won't have a brother-in-law to do stuff with, my parents won't have a son-in-law, I have to live with some if the family invalidating my orientation through believing it's a choice which will spill into other places, it's just a lot. Not a single thing could be wrong between my parents and I at any given time and that ping of guilt will hit me so hard. I'm sure therapy can help with this but I just wanted to talk about it here in case anyone else is going through the same thing"

I don't understand and I want to.,abramcpg,ainbow,"Firstly, I'm a cis straight male, 29yr who believes people should be free to love who they want (consensually of course) and that people should be free to express personal identity however they feel is true or fulfilling to them. 

Also, I'm not trying to make any kind of point here. There's probably a good reason for why people feel the way they do and I want help understanding them.

Please forgive and correct if I use improper terms. I don't mean disrespect in any way.

So I can wrap my head around that someone identifies with one, both, or neither gender. And I known there's a handful of other gender classifications for things I'm not considering atm (no disrespect to those not mentioned). But if we are considering gender to be an infinite and therefore difficult to identify spectrum, what's the point in the classification to begin with? It seems gender at that point is so specific, it's just identifying an individual. At that point, I'm no longer 97.6% towards male, I'm just Abram. I'm just me. I'm athletic, kind, non-aggressive, rebellious, and I don't really understand which personality traits would be related to my gender aside from that I have traditionally make genetalia and produce more than average testosterone.

Tl;dr: If there are infinite genders, what's the use in identifying by gender at that point?"
I was never expecting this,Necessary-Cress-6553,ainbow,"I never expected this

This is long and Im sorry about that but this is just I need to remember this one so I wrote it all down



Soooo a while ago... it was like in October I kinda in a way came out to my friend. I never actually said it but I think he figured it out when I gave him a blowjob... since then Ive had some wild experiences and my life has changed forever. 

I have explored my sexuality more in a month than I thought I ever would in my entire life. And Im glad I did because holy shit I guess the gay side of me has been waiting to come out for so long that when it did it was a lot and it hasnt slowed down at all and Ive loved every second of it. 

For those of you who dont know my from my posts in r/gayconfessions hi  Im 18 Im in high school and Im bisexual as fuck but to where I used to think I was maybe 20 to 80 gay to straight I was wrong the whole time its more like 60 40 or even 70 30. And so Ive been posting my wildest experiences on 
r/gayconfessions and Ive had some pretty great times. But this one probably tops all of them and its not even about sex. 

When I came out to my best friend I did it the way I did because honestly I was terrified and scared and I wanted a way out if he didnt feel the way I did and that was going to be me joking and I was just to scared to look him in the eyes and tell him that Im gay. But it ended up working out so I wouldnt go back and change it but I now know that he did feel the same way and I didnt need to be scared I could just be honest with him.

Last night he texted me asking if I wanted to get lunch today and so I said yes... and he said

Ok so its a date
You and me over lunch... Im excited 

And I had to sit there for a second and reread those texts a couple times. First off two months ago I never would have thought that he would use that emoji especially not when texting me. And I was also like this has to be my dyslexia I have to be reading this wrong. And so I texted back like date date?

And he said i mean if you want
And so I just said Id love to and he just responded with great Ill pick you up at 11:30

Soooooooooo.. I woke up today with butterflies and when he got here I told my parents we were just gonna hang out at his house and chill and stuff and then I got in his car and asked where we were going and he said it was a surprise. So when we got out of my neighborhood I leaned over and kissed him on the cheek and told him that I never would have expected this. Then he told me all about how he had had a crush on me since sophomore year and I couldnt believe it because I didnt even think he liked guys until maybe recently or when I made my move I just had never thought about it. And he told me that when I made my move he thought he was dreaming because he had wanted it to happen for so long and everything and so I was just surprised but also so happy.

Then we got to the park where we practiced soccer a lot and went near the back and parked his car. We got out and he opened up his trunk and there was picnic supplies and so we laid out a blanket and we got the food and sat down and it was so cute and it made me so happy. It had everything all different kinds of foods but that wasnt even the crazy part... there were candles and flowers. He bought me flowers. Can you believe that? And so I asked him if he did all this himself and he said his mom helped a lot. I was surprised that he got his parents involved but then he told me that his mom already knew and was super excited when he told her that we were going on a date today so she went all out. And Im just sitting there confused and I never would have guessed that but his parents are also way more progressive and accepting them mine but I was still surprised.

It wasnt perfect because the weather wasnt great it was pretty cold but I didnt care. I got close to him and we shared each others warmth. Ive never been on a better date. We were just talking and it was nice. After we were done eating I just laid down on my back and he laid down too but he put his head on my chest and I played with his hair as we talked more until I realized that we had been there too long and I had a class online that I had to get to. And he said he was sorry but I told him it was fine and I would rather stay where we were and so I just logged on on my phone said I was sorry for being late and turned off the volume. Now that we were both sitting up I leaned in and kissed him and I saw an old couple looking at us weird but he said he didnt care and we kissed again until we gave them something to look at as he said. It was a little cliche but it was cute so I let it slide. 

Then packed everything up and went back to his house. When I got there I saw his mom and I gave her a hug and I said thank you so much that was perfect and she was like I dont know what youre talking about and then pulled out from the hug and winked at me. She told me that she knew he was gay or at least bisexual long before he did and always thought wed be cute together. And Im just standing there thinking about whether or not my mom knows Im bisexual but then I said I wanted to hear more about it and she told me that she would talk all about it another time because he already looked embarrassed. Then she told him that she got more of what he asked for and that they were on his couch. 

So we went to his room and I sat down and grabbed the bag before he could and saw that it was condoms. I have never seen him more embarrassed and he was talking really fast about how his mom said that if youre going to have a boyfriend now you need to make him happy and to just let her know when so she could put on some head phones and... 
so I stopped him and I just said boyfriend
He was blushing even more at this point and so I stood up from his bed and he said oh yeah I know I told her that we werent going to put labels on it and she kept saying it and so uh 
And I told him its ok I like it and he stopped talking and looked away from the floor and at me and so I kissed him. And he asked if I was sure and I told him that I had waited for this forever and I never thought it would happen and that I was not going to waste time taking it slow and he kissed me. It was nothing long just a short little kiss that confirmed it. And so we sat down watched tv. Usually I would have kept kissing him and went down on him and turned it in to sex but honestly I thought the moment was so cute and a happy moment that I just wanted to leave it there and maybe later well have some fun but for now I just want to spend some time with him.

Im still at his house just chilling on his couch typing this. I didnt expect to finish this while I was still here but first I told him I had to use the restroom so I could write it then after a while of his mom texting him he went down there probably to talk about her embarrassing him but I told him I thought it was funny and that it was fine but it gave me time to write this and type out the story of the best day of my life so I can remember it forever."

I get stared at a lot by the same store clerk and Im wondering if he has a thing for me,Foreignerinnihon,ainbow,"
I'm in Japan right now, 23 years old male

I frequent this one shop about once or twice a week and im a regular. i usually get the same cashier and he seems to be the same age.

One thing I notice is when he sees me in the shop, his eyes follow me sometimes. when he checks out other customers items, he doesnt even look at the customers sometimes.

When i come around, i start to see a smile on his face, and he looks at me a lot. at times when there is a long queue, i catch him staring at me. sometimes as i leave his register, hed give me a small wave.

How it works when there is a queue, is that there are two cashiers and we wait for them to call us. This one time I got called by another cashier, and when the guy in question saw me, he was startled. Could also be because i came in a day i dont usually go to the store at.

Another time I got called by a diff cashier, and when the guy in question heard me talk to the cashier, he quickly turned his head around to see if it was me.

I dont want to seem like im jumping to conclusions. in all honesty, i am feeling a little bit lonely and could be becoming victim to my own thought hahaha

Do you guys think he has a thing for me? I dont even know if he is gay. Would be a bummer if he isnt though."

"With this year being the 30th anniversary of the Bisexual Manifesto, I present my proposal for a Bisexual Umbrella 2.0",sorcerykid,ainbow,"[The Bisexual Manifesto](https://bialogue-group.tumblr.com/post/17532147836/atm1990-bisexualmanifesto) has served as a cornerstone of the bi+ community for the past three decades, consistently affirming the experiences of bisexual, pansexual, and omnisexual people across the spectrum and giving a voice to those living outside of the gender binary.

I feel like we're now entering the next queer frontier, as more and more youth are challenging traditional binary notions of gender. While bisexuality already accounts for genders outside of the binary, it still quantifies and qualifies sexuality on the basis of each partner's gender identity.

Unfortunately, characterizing sexual or romantic attractions in the traditional manner of ""sexual orientation"" inherently disqualifies many gender variant people whose appearance, behavior, genitalia, etc. and other gender-specific traits are not in full alignment with societal norms and ideals. This limitation of language can prove to be a particular impediment for genderqueer, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people seeking acceptance and validation in the online dating world.

So back in 2015, I shared my proposal for a more inclusive definition of bisexuality with BiNetUSA, one which would engage and empower the bi+ community in the forthcoming decades:

I long for the day when all bisexual people can be attracted to whomever they happen to be attracted to, and that's it. No further explanation necessary. This would give us the freedom to embrace our true sexual nature, without having to constantly second guess the label that we choose to self-identify, moreless to be interrogated by those seeking to invalidate our sexuality."

Resums &amp; LGBTQ+ question,DorfTheDuckie,ainbow,"Hi,
I am not lgbtq+ so please correct me and help me be better and also on mobile. 

I am trying to help a relative who is nonbinary with their resume.  They were assigned male at birth, then started transitioning to female and legally changed their name to a ""girl"" name (this is over the past 10-15 years). Due to threats 
of violence and not passing to the extent they would like they have decided to stop caring about their gender identity.  Unfortunately, they are trying to apply to jobs and have legally changed their name that no longer fits the gender expression and they look more masculine now.

They are worried about putting their legal name on applications/resume and then not being selected because of the disconnect.  

I don't think they should put an ambiguous nick name down and we don't think they are in any danger to admit their gender and they are open about it if there are questions.

Is there a way to explicitly or not so explicitly mention it so the employers aren't caught off guard? Are there resources I could look through with them to help?

Sorry again if i made mistakes.  Thanks for any advice you can give.

I am completely worn out by straight oriented media,scout_14,ainbow,"I'm gonna start this by saying that I obviously don't hate straight ppl but I have to say this just in case. See it as frustraition venting or something because I don't want to be labeled as some sort of radicalist. I am tired of straight crushes/relationships/marriages being portrayed as dramatic/life changing/ really serious when same sex relationships in the same pieces of media are treated as accessories or something like that. I may not be really good at explaining it but I am sure some of you know what I am talking about. I don't mean to discuss a singular piece of media because I see this pattern in just about any show I watch that tries to implement gay/bi/pan characters with same sex relationships. It baits you and it tries to seem so diverse and open to ""portraying the real world"" but there is an enormous difference between the way straight characters are written and non straight ones(in terms of how much depth and how much dignity the character seems to have).Also the notion that a show can have 10+ straight characters that are/aren't involved with eachother sexually, but if you have 2 gays in a relationship it means there are already too many and we gotta stop hoping for more. I get that irl straights are majoritary by far more but this is a piece of media we are talking about. A piece of media showing characters that we are supposed to relate to and watch them as they overcome unexpected struggles in their worlds. Ur gonna make me keep up with watching about 3 disfunctional straight marriages/relationships and then throw in a lesbian in the middle of the 4th season and call it ""progressive"".
Really, my problem isn't the fact that these things exist, because I am aware there are lots of people that enjoy them as they are. My problem is that all these makers advertise their work as diverse and say shit like ""the times are changing guys"" while I look through all the things I want to watch and realize that only about a third of them are actually worth getting time invested in."

A new poem I wrote last week. NSFW,RabdyD1958,ainbow,"""Dreams""Randy Dickison

&amp;#x200B;

I had a good friend, that lived down the street.

I won't use his real name so let's call him Pete.

Dreaming of us naked and hugging in bed made me feel safe and warm.

But I was a boy, so my dreams weren't the norm.

I'd wake up still dreaming and played with myself.

I had no idea that was actually good for my health.

Don't sit there and judge me. You know that its true.

Playing with it is just something normal that all boys do.

It felt good, but I felt bad, and I know why.

Back in those days nobody let a boy like a guy.

This made me feel bad, like a strange little slut.

Resources for straight partner - top surgery doubts,Matosinhoslover,ainbow,"Im 33, AFAB, and married. Ive always been a tomboy and frequently get mistaken for a guy. Short hair, love to work out and wear sports clothes most of the time.

I dont want to change my pronouns or my name but I have been dreaming of top surgery since forever. I would be happy for any resources, links, tips for my husband.

He knows how I feel about my chest and my plans to undergo surgery but Im still worried that this might destroy our relationship. Its like: am I still woman enough without boobs? Will he feel gay if hes married to someone who can walk topless on the beach?
The weirdest thoughts going around in my head. What if he leaves me for someone with big boobs? (Actually we are polyamorous, so he can technically have a gf or a fwb if he wants).


Im just a mess. Im so excited thinking about a flat chest but my concerns about our relationship really make me hesitate."

Hi! Im looking for a book that handles homophobia delicately and thoroughly,mapleleaffriend,ainbow,"Hi! So I am doing NANO (National novel writing month) and I have realized that my story deals a lot with homophobia. Im bi (and apart of the United Methodist Church rn lol) so Im pretty familiar with homophobia and how that prejudice impacts people firsthand, but I still want to see an example of how a book deals with it well. 

Does anyone have a really good example of homophobia being handled well in literature? (Not just LGBT+ lit, but something about homophobia - especially violent homophobia.) Preferably in literary fiction or scifi/dystopia (because thats what my story is) 

Thank you so much! May you all have a lovely week

I was outed. I dont know what to do next,FlutterKatt,ainbow,"Without going into a lot of exhausting detail I dont have it in me to write the novel for. The incredibly short version is four plus years ago I came out to my parents as polyamorous. It didnt go well, but it went particularly poorly with my mom. We hoped that with time she would come around. But at the time my mom had threatened all of us if we came out to any of my grandparents particularly my grandmother that I was extremely close with. I was not ok with being threatened, but since the grandparents were all dealing with some major health issues and in there mid late 80s at the time I agreed thinking it was to not add any additional stress to them.  I wasnt happy about it as I was hoping that the one grandma would be at least understanding of our strange little family. But it wasnt a fight I felt I could handle making right then and over time it just became less important as I live on the other side of the country and my grandma Im close too isnt an idiot and she knew something was going on and she would ask some things and I made it very clear that nothing was going on that want fully transparent to all parties and everyone was fine with it and encouraging. That was enough for me.

I found out this last week that my mom had outed me to my grandma that I am close with. My mother apparently complained when I brought up my partners name when she (my mom) asked what our thanksgiving plans were (we are going over to partners Monday after and cooking a feast at partners place as partner has double ovens and an amazeballs stove) She also apparently portrayed poly as that I am cheating etc. and basically made things sound as bad as they possibly can. So I got preachy religious judgmental comments thrown at me followed by please dont tell my mother I said anything please. 

I dont know where to go from here. I am still seeing red at the hurt and betrayal of being outed in such a bullshit and inaccurate way to someone that I really love and care about. But Im also just gutted and hurt by them both in ways I cant even find words to describe. I dont know where else to go for advice on this. I dont know what to do. But I know I have to do something and soon as I am expected to call on Thanksgiving no matter what if for no other reason than so my kid can say happy thanksgiving."

Am I cisgender?,chordgasms,ainbow,"I was assigned male at birth, and I still identify as a man and use he/him pronouns; but I also use they/them pronouns and identify as non-binary and gender non-conforming. 

By MY understanding, this means I'm cisgender, since I still identify with the sex I was assigned at birth (although not exclusively). 

It's weird to grapple with especially in online circles, though. Most LGBT+ folks on twitter and the like would never use ""cis"" to identify someone who uses they/them pronouns in any capacity.

Am I too hung up on this? Maybe. But for now I still identify as cisgender."

Am I pan? Bi? Queer?,zucchinirat1,ainbow,"Hi guys, sorry if this is inappropriate for this sub.

Basically when as soon as I learned there was something other than straight or gay, I knew that's what I was. The first term I heard was bisexual. Now I know that there's more than just that, there is pansexual and queer as well. Through my late teens and now into my early twenties I had been using these terms interchangeably. I'm coming to realize that these are not interchangeable terms and I want to correct myself. I need some advice on which term is the correct to use for myself without misrepresenting people, as I have been doing.

I genuinely don't want to misrepresent or offend anyone, I just want a conversation about this so I can learn about what I've been saying and how I could potentially be hurting anyone by it - and also so I can learn how to accurately identify myself. I really don't want to continue being ignorant about my own community, so please anything helpful is welcome."

How Can I Support My Trans Brother?,SuicidalHoe,ainbow,"Background because I feel it's needed:
Our family is very supportive of LGBT+ rights and everything under the sun. My mom and I are both bisexual. 

My older brother is 22. We'll call him Alex
I am 21, 
My trans brother is 13, we'll him Louie 
My sister is 10, she won't be in the story

The 2 youngest share the same dad, and Alex and I share another dad. 

When I was growing up, my mom would preach about lgbt and her support, as she suspected Alex  to be gay. He's not, but the support was there and I learned what lgbt+ was from her. 

More recently: I moved back in with my mom for a year before eventually getting my own place. While I was living with her, I suspected Louie wasnt gonna be my sister much longer. So I did what my mom did and I preached about how supportive I am of lgbt+. My mom took this differently than I thought she would, and kept trying to shut me down. I guess within the 8 year age gap my mom decided 12 was too young to learn about this stuff. (This was a year ago)

This year, Louie moved to another state to live with his dad, and then shortly after, came out to Alex and I privately in dms and let us know that they're a guy and would prefer the use of they/them and he/him pronouns. So now my sister is my brother as I suspected. I asked him if he told our mom yet, to which he said no. 

Ps: I know very little about Louie's dad as we do not share the same father. I know their dad typically does not share the same views as my mom, as she has complained vaguely about that previously. I know their dads sister comes by and gives my younger siblings company whenever they would visit. And I know that other than this aunt, their dad does not have any other family and has never done anything with family for the holidays since we've known him. But that's all I really know about their dad. 


I will not force Louie to tell our family. In fact, I'm just waiting right now for when they're ready. I know our mom will support him but I understand if he doesn't know that based on our moms previous reactions when I'd bring up lgbt around him. 

So as someone who has had no prior connections to those who are transitioning and knows like next to nothing about what he might be going through,  how do I support Louie and also keep it on the down low?"

Shaming gay ppl? (Reposted to get more opinions),-confusedconfliction,ainbow,"I don't know if it's just me but I really don't like when people say someone is gay person in denial or a DL person, just because they being homophobic bc:
1. I don't think that's true, on a massive scale.( I feel most ppl really believe that say)
2. Feels like it shames gay people in the closet. ( Not directly but indirectly)
3. It also feels indirectly homophobic (kinda, I don't 100 feel this) for example:
 homophobe: *say homopbic things* 
Normal person : we'll be waiting for you to come out of the closet.

This one isn't the best example but its basically not acknowledging their statement (however dumb it might be) by saying/shaming them ""haha you're actually gay"" as if that would be a problem. Besides we do know gay people can be homophobic, gay conservatives exist. 

Example for point 2:
homophobe: *say homopbic things* 
Normal person : we'll be wait for you to come out of the closet.

Same thing here, its doesn't acknowledge statement and says or shames them(kinda) by saying,"" you're in the closet, so sad"".

I might be reaching fr, but I do feel icky about these.
Also I understand that most of the times these jokes are meant to joke about the hypocrisy or to make the homophobic person mad, it just feels slightly homophobic by extension.

Any Closeted ppl want tell me how they feel about this."

Lesbian bars are in danger,Sxzzling,ainbow,"Thats right. Many safe spaces are in danger as currently in the US, there are only 15 lesbian bars remaining. In the 1980s there were ~200. Yes, as we progressed our safe spaces degressed, to the point of extinction for many. 

Many of the 15 bars have began selling bear, collaborating with artists, fundraising and other methods to stay afloat. While there may not be any around you, these 15 serve as a sanctuary, a place of acceptance for many which provides a feeling of normalcy in a world where its so easy to be discriminated against for sexuality, race, gender identity, etc. 


This is not my project/I have no affiliation or representation, but something I feel is important to share with the community. There is currently a campaign called [the Lesbian Bar Project](https://www.lesbianbarproject.com/) working to raise funds and awareness to ensure [all 15](https://www.lesbianbarproject.com/the-15-bars-home) stay afloat. I understand times are tough, but even bringing awareness to the campaign and these businesses make a huge difference!

Looking for GBT Fathers for GWU Research,jesschillin,ainbow,"We are conducting a qualitative study on queer fathers parenting and attachment development. We are seeking to better understand how those who identify as queer fathers developed parenting and attachment skills and abilities. Your participation in our study is requested because you identify as (a) either male, cisgender male, or transgender male, (b) queer (e.g., gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual), and (c) a father who is expecting a child within 9-months or has a child under the age of 18.

Thus, we are seeking volunteers to participate in a research study involving two (2) interviews and two (2) member checks. The interview will involve two 45 (minimum) to 90 (maximum) minute interviews over the phone or via Skype or Zoom, which will be based on your reported preference. These will be focused on asking questions about your experiences with developing parenting and attachment skills and abilities. The member check will involve two (2) meetings lasting between 5-30 minutes. The member checks focus on checking the accuracy of our research findings and provide you with time to provide any additional thoughts or clarifications. All interviews will occur over the phone, Skype, or Zoom. Your participation is completely voluntary, and your consent may be withdrawn at any time. Your experiences will be used to develop further understanding of queer father parenting and attatchment . The results and participant de-identified data will be used in any subsequent presentations or publications. In total, this study should range between 100-240 minutes. No incentives will be directly provided to you for your participation.

If you are interested in participating, I can give you more information. Please DM me!"

How does I tell prospective boyfriend that Im enby??,Indecisive_Monster32,ainbow,"Sooo theres this guy that Ive been hanging out with, and sort of dating, and I really like him and he seems to really like me, and I could see us becoming a couple.

My problem: I have not told him Im nonbinary yet. 

I identify as genderfae, or just nonbinary in general, and sometimes I dress femininely when the mood strikes and sometimes masculinely, he doesnt seem to care. But I have not outright told him that I dont identify as a girl. 

My question: When should I tell him? Is it something that needs to be said before becoming anything official or do I wait until after? 
Also: how does one bring this up??

My problem part 2: Theres a bit of a language barrier. Hes relatively new to the country so his English isnt great. (I dont even know how he feels about lgbt people because Ive been too nervous to bring it up.) The point of me mentioning this is that I can hardly explain my gender identity to native English speakers, how do I explain when he may not understand what I mean?

I really like this guy, I dont want to mess this up, but I feel like he deserves to know.

Any and all advice is welcome :)"

I'm afraid my parents won't love me anymore if I come out,DepressedSapphic,ainbow,"(Incoherent rant incoming. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I just need somewhere to get this off my chest)

I've struggled with depression for a while now, but I thankfully have been blessed with loving parents who have supported me through my toughest moments. However, I am gay and still in the closet, and I am terrified that if I come out my parents will stop loving me. 

Although my parents are overall good people, they're homophobic on religious grounds, and have openly mocked the LGBTQ+ movement b/c they think it's anti-Christian and weird. They aren't the kind of people who rant about it all the time, but when the subject comes up I hear their contempt of it, although my mom does at least acknowledge that there's ""plenty of good people who are gay"" even if she ""doesn't agree with the lifestyle"".

It's just been really hard and causing me a lot of distress and self-hatred. My parents are the only people in my life that I can confide in and who love me. I feel that if I come out to them I've betrayed them somehow, and that they'll stop loving me and I'll deserve it. Realistically, they probably won't stop loving me, but I'm also afraid that they might start using tough love on me in order to make me ""straight again"" or something like that. They aren't very strict, so that hopefully won't happen. I'm just terrified that if they know I'm gay everything will change about how they treat me, or that I'll just become more of a burden on them."

If you are a fluent mandarin speaker thats even better!

For context: Chinese gay men are mostly closeted, and often feel the need to marry women and have children because of societal expectations and legal reasons.

I am gay or not please help me,Jacktuu,ainbow,"Hi, my name is T. I am 17. I need to decide what I should do with my sexuality. For this reason, I am gonna share my history. Since I was born, people were affectionate about how humble and gentle I am, as I never had a brother, but many sisters (cousins, and one sister). I even had a nickname "" girl T"". Fortunately, I was raised by my grandpas and, they loved me with their whole hearts, which means I am kinda really sensitive one iniside my body. I likely to hug so while sleeling, because I used to cuddle with my sister while sleeping together. I did sth naughty with one of my sisters(cousin), but also had a oral sexes with my two cousins (boys), when I was young. I did have only one girl friend, when I was in 6th grade, but many good friends. As I said, I cant help hugging someone whom I sleep together, no matter who is that person. Also, I always found myself cuddling with my friends when we slept together and, I liked it so much. I loved my friends so much. I would even give them gifts on their birthdays. Like my peers, I started to jerk off and watch porn, which let me meet gayporn and, I was fond of it. I found myself waching gayporn about 3 years, becuase I didnt have time to think about it. Moreover, I used to do a lot lessons, which awarded me full scholarship and other. I didnt have friends for a long time, but i found my life friends 2 about 2 years ago. I love them more than my old friends because they understand me well,  take care of me, know how much I love my friends. This friendship even led me to understand what being smart is not the most important thing in life but happiness. I was afraid of falling in love with them. So I thought that I should take care of my sexuality, I cant be gay becuase my countrys people dont accept it. I hated myself a lot, but i was determined to change my sexuality. For this, I confessed it to my one friend, becuase I thought that I should accept to overcome this. He understood me well and, we are now still best pals. From that time on, I stopped to watch gayporn; however, sometimes I lost. Now I am here to understand and find myself. In fact, I cant imagine myself with guy, but I have sth different. I love my friends so much. I like to watch gayporn and play with my hole. Can I be straight one. I dont wanna cheat myself, but I cant be gay especially in my country. In summer, I went to countryside with my relatives and prayed about this reason a lot. Unfortunately, When I slept with my cousin who I used to have oral sex, I hugged him a lot, which aroused him. He ended up sucking my cock. I didn't want it, but I did it too. In the morning, I felt gross and hated myself a lot. I mustnt be gay. I dont know what I should do. Please, help me."

Is coming out necessary?,AnonQsIask,ainbow,"I am on mobile but my grammar is usually bad as I write how I speak. I will try to make it understandable but its 6 in the morning and I havent slept.

I only have a few friends from the LGBT community ( not on purpose, I have had the same group of friends for 12 years). When they came out to me I was extremely happy that they knew I would be understanding or that they cared about me enough to tell me. Even when my ex told me I felt happy that he knew I would be understanding. 
The problem I have is when I imagine a scenario of my son coming out as gay, transgender, non-binary etc, I get disappointed? I feel like he shouldnt have to. 
Any films/tv programmes I have watched always show a coming out situation. The only time this was not the case is James Charles mentioning he never came out to his parents on a video.

I want my son to bring home a boyfriend in the same way he would bring home a girlfriend, or ask for make up tips as if he is just asking for homework advice. But the more I think of it, compared to stories I see online, the more I believe I am being too unrealistic, possibly even wrong.

What would make you feel like you didnt have to have a big coming out conversation? Or if you didnt, what made you feel like you didnt need to? Would I be failing if he did feel like he had to have a sit down coming out conversation? 

I should note my son is very young, I watch LGBT positive programmes around him and I make sure to speak thoughtfully when discussing certain subjects around him, but I really cant sit down and explain anything to him yet. Im hoping to gather some views around the purpose of coming out and the need for it."

Shaming closest gay ppl?,-confusedconfliction,ainbow,"I don't know if it's just me but I really don't like when people say someone is gay person in denial or a DL person, just because they being homophobic bc:
1. I don't think that's true, on a massive scale.( I feel most ppl really believe that say)
2. Feels like it shames gay people in the closet. ( Not directly but indirectly)
3. It also feels indirectly homophobic (kinda, I don't 100 feel this) for example:
 homophobe: *say homopbic things* 
Normal person : we'll be waiting for you to come out of the closet.

This one isn't the best example but its basically not acknowledging their statement (however dumb it might be) by saying/shaming them ""haha you're actually gay"" as if that would be a problem. Besides we do know gay people can be homophobic, gay conservatives exist. 

Example for point 2:
homophobe: *say homopbic things* 
Normal person : we'll be wait for you to come out of the closet.

Same thing here, its doesn't acknowledge statement and says or shames them(kinda) by saying,"" you're in the closet, so sad"".

I might be reaching fr, but I do feel icky about these.
Also I understand that most of the times these jokes are meant to joke about the hypocrisy or to make the homophobic person mad, it just feels slightly homophobic by extension.

Pronouns do not exist to describe you as an individual. They exist in our language so we collectively can understand the context of a conversation. They exist so we understand that someone is referring to an individual when they speak.


Gender-neutral pronouns (they/them) are VERY important and necessary. They, like he/him/she/her, are pronouns we collectively understand what means. That's their function. Pronouns are not titles.



If you want a new word that describes you as a person, that's what a *name* is for. Names don't have to have meaning. Pronouns do.




IMO, these kind of neo-pronouns show an intense level of self-absorption because you're demanding that language, and all of society that participates in language, changes to suit you and only you. It seems that people who invent these pronouns don't understand, or don't care about, what pronouns actually exist for

"Belated Happy Diwali Redditors! How is my Bisexual, Pansexual and Polysexual themed Rangoli?",DiffIsUnique,ainbow, 
Im just tired of this already. Pls help,Hyphen1-2,ainbow,"Hey everyone. Im a 16 year old closeted gay kid. I have been posting on Reddit about my self discovery and coming out journey since the beginning of last year. To sum it all up, its been me hiding who I am because Im scared of what other people will think. Im just done with it. I hate it and want to come out, yet Im scared of the people I love the most pushing me away because of it. My parents are the ones I love the most. They are Catholic and Hispanic, the two together dont sound like a good mix. However, it hasnt been exactly as bad as it sounds it would. They have never said anything about the LGBT community, however, they also havent said anything good about them either. Its just been unspoken about. Through the time Ive been questions, Ive picked up on some clues on what they think of LGBT people but the clues are all over the place. 

For example, when Bad Blood by Taylor Swift came out, i would sing it in the car with my older sister ( now 23 and would probably accept me) and one time my dad asked my why i was singing it because it was a girl song. Last year my parents told me before that my hand gestures and facial expressions are a little extra and awkward. If you dont know already, these things are stereotypes of women and gay men. Also, when I told my mom most of my friends were girls, she said I should try making more guy friends. My brother was talking about pink on men and my mom said that guys dont wear pink, which is obviously wrong but I mean thats the way she grew up. When we watch shows with lgbt characters, they fast forward when the lgbt couple make out. 

But with all these negatives, Ive noticed some positives, like I mean even though they fast forward through lgbt kisses, theyre open to watching movies or shows with lgbt characters and dont say anything bad about them like modern family with a gay couple. My mom also tells me shell always love me no matter what every night before bed. My dad says he has a special connection with me than he has with my older siblings because I am more affectionate. He also said hell miss me so much when I move out for college. (So if he would miss me moving out to college, I dont see how he wouldnt miss me if he was given the opportunity to kick me out.) 

Yesterday, I was driving alone with my dad and he was opening up to me about some drama and incidents that happened with his family when I wasnt born. Long story short, back in the day, his brothers girlfriend (who is now his wife and my aunt) had created drama with my dads parents and all of their siblings. When my uncle decided he still wanted my aunt and that they could work it out and fix the relationship between the family, my dad asked him if he was sure that he wanted my aunt and that even though they had drama and wasnt sure about my aunt, he would still be happy for my uncle. He said if my uncle was happy, then he was happy for him. So Im wondering if he would still use the same logic today with me, if Im happy with a man, he would be happy for me. We also talked about my cousins who are adopted and he said that he loves them even though that they arent blood related and that they are still my cousins no matter what. So I thought again, if I adopt children with a man, would he still love them as if they were his grandchildren? Only time will tell. 

I feel like my dad knows some stuff about the lgbt community, however I dont think my mom knows much. My last post was about this, but basically my mom and I were talking about politics and how trump has done some not so nice things to minorities. We saw a rainbow flag and I slid it into our conversation subtly to see what she would say and when I talked about it, she asked me what it stood for. I dont know if its just not a generational thing, but she didnt know what the rainbow flag stood for. I told her it stood for gay people (even though it stands for the whole lgbt community, I didnt want to confuse my mom so I just said gay people) after I told her what it stands for and how trump has done some not so nice things to them, she said what a bunch of nonsense. As for that I dont know if she was talking about gay people being nonsense or how Trump treats people is not nice. I dont want this to be political but my mom isnt in favor of trump so it would make more sense she is calling him nonsense but I dont know. 

I have no idea how my parents will react but I feel like my high school years and teen years are passing by. I know its not important but Ill never be able to experience a high school fling, Ill never be able to join the cheer team like I want to without giving people ideas, Ill never be able to enjoy the feminine music I enjoy all because Im trying to hide who I am. I just want out. Please help, any advice is welcomed. Thank you."

A Story to tell...,BKS_Chris,ainbow,"I introduce myself, my name is Chris, I am 16 years old and I have a story to tell , above all, I am French so I may make spelling mistakes.

Since my childhood, I often left my grandparents on holidays and weekends, I enjoyed my days there, but they are very busy with work so I often stay with my uncle, one day, my uncle told me to play a GAME ""To play ADULT games"" like ""Suck my .... Open your butt ... He was telling me that it is a game between me and him and that I must tell anyone. Since I was a child, I hadn't said anything, because on the one hand it was fun (please don't judge me), the first time I had it that I remembered was probably when I was in CP (1st Grade), then sometimes, I found it strange, the way he told me that I must tell no one, I was afraid to talk about it because he made me look at him when he was pissed off and I didn't like my parents too much, always strict at school (Work well, have a good grade, do your homework ...) and my parents are of Congolese origin. Then it continued until in CM2 (5th G roadstead), I did it about twice or more, per week, I had even seen once, semen come out, it's weird to say that if I did it for 5 years, it would be the equivalent or more of 3 months of sex but everything has an end. ( 1/7)

&amp;#x200B;

One day, there was a teacher in fifth grade that I really appreciate, she loved me but for my explosive and hyperactive personality so one day, I told her what I did with my parents, she was shocked by this. she heard and immediately called my parents. My parents heard what the mistress said and they too were shocked, he told my grand parents, my grandparents furious with him would have hit him to the point of blood. They obviously called the police, they told me what I did with him, I told them everything then I did not see my uncle again and they told me that the procedure of his trial will be in 5 years. And there, we could say end of the story but no, I'm only at the beginning. (2/7)

My super friend \[Rock\] came to sleep at my place one day because a person of his family had died, one night he showed me a hentai (porn anime), I was fascinated a little because what I was doing with my uncle was the same as in the video, so some nights I watched this, but it happened to me sometimes when I dreamed my uncle blocked me with chains and he raped me, I never happened not to wake up because strangely, it was as if my body did not want to move (I learned later that it was sleep paralysis because I sleep too traditional), at the beginning, it sometimes happened so that it goes on and on ... One day when I was in 7th Grade, going to jerk off to porn, my penis was smaller than usual, then for a while I wrote on google, gay porn i watched a video and my cock was bigger than before so i had a homo orientation. (3/7)

&amp;#x200B;

So, personally, the fact of seeing two guys kissing or kissing makes me neither hot nor cold, because having done it with my uncle, I found it quite normal but my parents were homophobic to a great extent (they are Christian ), then I started to get fucked by my friends in some dreams, my friends were homophobic but I stayed with them because they were my friends and anyway, they don't know anything about me, one day I loved a friend of mine, did I really love him? Or is it because I wanted to do it with him like my dreams, I was a little scared to face him, so I sent him a quick note after class, then the next day he avoided me like I never understood that at that moment being gay is not that easy, I told him it was a prank for jokes and he believed me and he said ""You to me scared, I really knew you were one of those PD. (pejorative word that says homo, I think we say that in English, fagot. and he was a Muslim) I was surprised, one of my best friends would hate me if he knew it was the truth, I understood that if I was gay my partners would reject me and my friends too ... So I thought I have an idea, I'm going to watch straight porn only to become a straight one. But the sexual urges got too strong, I jerked off on my friends sometimes, I thought I was going to stop this tomorrow, but I made it continue but to fantasize about a teacher and even on manga heroes. It pissed me off, I had to force myself to please society, I watched blogs on the same subject of people who assume themselves as they are but I, I couldn't, I was quite weak mentally, my parents me. always belittles for things of no interest (Chris, you didn't fix your room, Idiot, Bastard,), I even came to try to kill myself one day but when I was at the window, I said ""No, but seriously, do you really want to jump?"" so I did not succeed for fear of the fall and the pain, I even got angry at god, insulting him all the names because I want to change but he not help me and many others die and he does not help them, I became an atheist, I wrote a lot, I have to finish because in France, it is 2h. (4/7)

This situation continued until the end of my 10th grade, during my vacations, I was out with my friends and my super friend, Rock and I loved one friend in particular, he was normal physically but when I was with him, I was happy, I didn't know if it was love or friendship, one day, when I was depressed, I said that I loved him, but he did misunderstood, he thought I was gay, and he said ok, he wasn't surprised. So it was okay, I had made a huge mistake, if he would have understood it it would have done as before, but after he understood that I told him, he did not want to see me anymore, he sent his message. cousin say a word to me for him because he didn't want to see me anymore: He said it's not against you, but he doesn't want to be friends with this kind of people, he said he ordered me 3 rule: 1, you don't talk to him and his friends too, 2, you don't greet them, 3, you don't know them and they don't know you. I had accepted these rules because I knew I had to say nothing and I was a fool but when I played outside when I saw him my legs would run in fear and shame and when our eyes widened he avoided me everything immediately, which made me sad, one day, furious about everything, I understood that it was all my uncle's fault, my life, my actions and all... I stole money from my mother, and I'm went to my grandparents, when I returned home in rage, I saw her, OKLM, him, he had everything, friends, girlfriend and everything I rushed to him and I beat him, I gave him kick the ball big and I punched him in the face while he was on the ground, my grandparents stopped me right away after seeing the scene but I made him brush his face , he even lost a tooth, I had hit him to relieve all my anger but it was not enough. My parents came, engulfed me, I got punched by my father, then they thought I was crazy, so they sent me to a psychologist and my grandmother's friend. (5/7)

&amp;#x200B;

My uncle was brought back to the hospital and his trial would take place at the end of October. This psychologist was quite beautiful, she gave me praise, with her I felt good so I opened up to her about everything I have experienced. She offered me special sessions so that I would become non-gay but straight. I was quite surprised by what she told me but I accepted after all, it is surely the solution to all my problems. But she asked me things I would never have thought of, she showed me two hairy guys having sex but coming out of the poop of their anus to make me disgust, she told me to watch videos of an hour, a moment, I couldn't take it anymore, I told her that we should stop, but she shouted at me saying ""Do you want to become straight or not? If so, stay and support, it's better than locking yourself up alone ""so I continued the sessions, she measured that my penis got smaller, then she said things to me like"" Get naked and jerk off on me ""I did it years to contester, after all, it is either that or I kill myself at one point or another. Then one day, she told me to fuck her, so I did but just when I was going to put my penis in her vagina ... Someone knocked on the door and interrupted us so we stopped. Then after 26 sessions with them including 24 specials and 2 which were normal, I returned home to prepare for my return to school. (, thanks for watching it until then, continue until the end, please.) (6/7)

&amp;#x200B;

I had become straight, when watching gay porn my penis was limited a little bigger than the non-erection size. We should say yeah, end of story but watch the rest ... Coming back to my 11th grade wasn't as happy as I thought it was, I often met my friends (old friends, should I say.) At every time I saw them, I was forced to give myself a flashback of what I did and what I said. In itself, I was forced by society to change otherwise I would be rejected, I know myself and I know that I do not have the strength to speak out against homophobic insults. On my grandfather's birthday, my psychologist, Mme Merah was present, I was surprised by her coming but she is my grandmother's friend, she told me in my ear, that it was is here that I will finish what we could not finish. uh ... no but she's crazy she wants me to do it on my grandpa's birthday i said no to her but, she picked up her phone and put on an audio of me i said i was in love of a boy, she had recorded our conversation, she told me that if I did not do it, she would give it to my mother, no but if my mother listened to this, I risk the door so I agreed against- heart, and so I did it with her (without a condom), she had taught me some positions during my sessions so I did them with her and I ejaculate in her and I couldn't get out in time, but she told me she took pills so she won't be pregnant. She tells me that now, that you've finished our sessions, I'm going to delete all of our audio, you'll probably think to yourself but why did you call the fucking police? because although I was her sex toy, she allowed me to become straight. Then there was the trial of my uncle. I was not able to participate because what seems I risk being influenced, the trial ended in 7 and a half years. Although I became straight, my uncle was punished, I'm not that happy, probably because I lost my great friends, my parents put me down like shit, but I want to be happy and I would surely find out by growing up ... do you think i should talk to my corn? and what do you think of my story? am I disgusting in your eyes? AND THANKS AGAIN FOR READING ALL THIS MORE THAN I HAD TO PASS SOME POINTS TO NOT MAKE LONGER THAN THAT. AND I ASSURE YOU THIS IS NOT TROLL. ( 7/7)"
Confusing feeling about bisexuality,lizalupi,ainbow,"I'm a 21 F, I've known I'm bisexual since age 12 and was seriously obsessed with Megan Fox lol. The problem is I'm always torn between if I'm trully BI or actually lesbian. I've only had boyfriends (always 2+ years relationships) but with years passing I'm so much more sexually attracted to girls and doing anything with   actually disgusts me, and before I was never particularly interested. But I love my boyfriend and maybe a factor is I have pain with intercourse. I romantically prefer boys and never been with a girl (other than making out and casually dating).I don't know how to even interact with girls romantically. I'm a femme and I prefer femme's, also an unusual combination. To make my life harder I live in a small country and apparently all LGBT people here are hiding because I don't have a single gay friend.  Any similar struggles or any advice how to navigate this?"
"Happy Trans Awareness Week! Here's a life update with some celebrations, concerns &amp; questions!",TaylorLakhryst,ainbow,"Hi everyone! I fell off Reddit for a bit ... I'm sorry! I joined this group literally a few minutes ago because I want to get more engaged with Reddit again. With it being Trans Awareness Week I feel it's a great time to share a life update! I came out pretty abruptly this summer and things got exceptionally cranked up in August when my parents reacted exactly as I expected. It really lit a fire under me. I couldn't file for a legal name change fast enough and I feel I have absolutely stripped off the shackles that kept me as a fraction of myself for my entire life. I have since been working incredibly hard at advocating for trans rights in quite a few situations and so far I am pretty proud about myself. I've found most of my time over the past few months on r/Twitter. I don't have r/Facebook or r/Instagram accounts for example and I ended up in the middle of a ... [rather serious project](https://twitter.com/energy106fm/status/1299527429485203456).

Ultimately, I've got three goals I'd like to accomplish as part of my journey. My first goal is based on my belief that we are long overdue for visible r/trans inclusivity in r/sports, and by that I mean have dialogue present regarding rules, policies, divisions, insurance and so on explaining that divisions are based on r/gender identity &amp; expression, not biological sex. That said, I am aware of the fluidity of that statement and understand there are times where in the interest of competitiveness or player safety physiological factors need to be considered, especially at elite-level play or in sports where weight classes matter. Overall though, there is no reason otherwise why trans r/athletes should be prevented from or discriminated against competing in a division that is in line with their preferred gender identity and/or expression.

[I've got a thread that I'm using](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1317475890691928065) to keep some awareness up particularly relating to Sport Manitoba (while it also was [a retweet throwing a bit of shade](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1298790120447852545) to a local radio station hiring [a known transphobic radio host](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-wheeler-trans-comments-1.4749616) who [has been endorsed by a member of our queer community](https://twitter.com/ctvwinnipeg/status/1298775987761553413) and insists they will continue to be [one of the strongest media allies to the LGBTQ community in Winnipeg](https://i.imgur.com/3mRIcuj.jpg). \*sorrywhat.gif\*

I'll get back to the radio station in a bit. That thread also dropped [a note to Slo-Pitch National regarding their rules](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1316459613038886912) and of where trans athletes are to fall in with their verbiage. I'm happy to report that unlike the [bureaucratic approach I feel I received from Sport Manitoba](https://i.imgur.com/SuNDvfq.jpg), Slo-Pitch National was almost [immediately engaged after a few tweet attempts went their way](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1319835275351085056). I had an absolutely wonderful conversation with Trish and I strongly believe we will be having more follow-up conversations about how to implement things effectively, assertively, competitively and in a way that prevents abuse.

If I can help encourage programs to start having more visible acknowledgement of trans athletes and having inclusive dialogue and programming in their systems, that will do nothing but benefit one of the core obstacles about trans people in general: awareness. That verbiage can introduce conversations earlier, end controversies sooner, offer courage and support to trans people from children to adults that they have a welcoming place to belong, provide an improved fundamental understanding that people are different and to open minds and hearts about it, and even to improve demographics so that better social, medical, educational, and r/mentalhealth services can become available.

My second goal, as a matter of fact, is to at least be put in consideration for the [Order of Manitoba](https://www.manitobalg.ca/awards/order-of-manitoba/). I never thought about it before but I remember coming across it at some point and thought, ""Screw this. I'm earning it."" The Order of Manitoba was established to recognize individuals who have demonstrated excellence and achievement in any field of endeavour benefiting in an outstanding manner the social, cultural or economic well-being of r/Manitoba and its residents. I feel that if I continue to work as hard as I can to break barriers, raise awareness and continue to denounce injustice against not only r/transgender Manitobans but transgender people as a whole, the least I could hope for is to be thought of when it's time to think of who helps make Manitoba be a better place. Personally, I've suffered a walled-up life for pretty much 39 years and if I can do my part to ensure that no person has to feel like they need to be anyone but their authentic and best selves, I will pull out every stop that I am able to because unless you're trans, you simply don't get what it's like.

A rather surreal experience that reminded me that I'm on course to my goal lately was having conversation with the national director of the Run for Women! It started after I pinned [a note](https://i.imgur.com/cJEisYc.jpg) on my Twitter profile which eventually led to an amazing response and a subsequent Zoom session with Ted and Stephanie. Hearing the interest, recognition, and commitment to make the Run for Women a more welcoming and inclusive event for all r/women was exciting, and being asked to be kept in touch with during the progress has felt immensely meaningful.

I feel I have really taken advocacy for trans rights seriously ever since I came out and that leads to my third goal that I currently have. I feel I am on a path of creating a legacy and I can only hope that one day people will hear my name and immediately recognize my effort to raise awareness and help normalize the belonging of trans people in a predominantly cisnormative world. Sometimes it feels petty but I would absolutely love to get verified by Twitter at some point because of that. As much as blue isn't my favourite colour, I feel it would look great beside [my name](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst). I feel it's a great way to suggest that I know what I'm doing and I'm not taking any of this lightly at all.

When I came out as abruptly as I did, it was with the full intention to raise awareness and educate, especially using the element of shock to prompt reflections into the minds of others. I came out right after George Floyd was murdered because our planet was reeling on yet another example that if you're not White and Right, you're fighting for a place to coexist. Minority groups all over the planet, and obviously the Black community at large, were screaming for reforms to improve diversity, r/Equity and r/Inclusion. To eliminate r/racism. To eliminate discrimination. I felt there was no better time to capture that momentum. After I came out, I lost track of the amount of times someone would say that they had no idea, and rightfully so. I began to come out socially on my 39th birthday so for all intents and purposes the only person most people ever knew or recognized was a white, athletic, 39-year-old r/Canadian male. I was as close to the top of the food chain that someone could really get. I bled privilege that I didn't even want because it was nothing but imbued irony because it would almost all be erased if I allowed myself to be vulnerable and authentic.

Becoming vulnerable and authentic is exactly what I chose to do. I didn't do that necessarily because I wanted to, and it certainly wasn't because I was ready to, but I had no choice except that I HAD to. As a person, I am far too strong, far too vocal, far too educated and far too articulated to stay quiet any longer. I know I've got the skillset and r/resilience to help make the world a better place and if anything I feel guilty for not allowing myself to start working on it years earlier. Even as I write about this life update, I think about [a blog post that was written about me](https://spitfiretakesontheworld.blogspot.com/2020/10/what-taylor-should-say-to-energy-106.html?spref=tw) and to this day am so humbled about it. More than ever have I felt like I'm making a difference instead of being a burden and it inspires me to keep pushing forward.

I've alluded to it a couple times already and one of the biggest missions I have been on lately is advocating on the absolute faux pas of a local radio station hiring someone who has [said dehumanizing things about transgender people](https://imgur.com/a/fTBn0CX), [has not shown public atonement for it](https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/winnipegs-radio-radical-is-ready-to-wrangle-572233362.html), and then being protected by the radio station while they affirm to be r/LGBTQ\+ allies. One of the biggest reasons I am invested in this is because of the message that is being sent to minority communities across the board: If you are privileged, you are protected. The message that forgiveness is to be expected of the victims instead of earned by the offenders really sums up segregation, discrimination and overall mental unwellness in a nutshell.

Personally, I felt my drive for this situation to really light up after Energy 106 FM posted their ""Official Statement,"" which for the record was Friday, August 28, at 9:00 PM. Only until recently in a meeting I had with [Adam West, their Program Director](https://www.energy106.ca/adam-west/), that they had intention of posting that late largely due to Facebook algorithms. All I really had to reply on that was considering the amount of controversy regarding the release of the message, they could have at least addressed the concern with an explanation instead of perpetually ignoring the call-outs. Another interesting take in that same meeting was that they were waiting for that memo to be vetted by one transgender person, which I learned after asking who the ""numerous meaningful and significant conversations"" involved because I can't imagine a single resource centre in r/Winnipeg that would have given this hire a green light. Regardless, I had no problem [expressing my thoughts about the situation](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1299539266561744897) and since made a decision to keep my eye on it.

One of the reasons why I struggled to feel comfortable coming out was because I wasn't ready to be as loud as I knew I was capable of being. For at least half my life I've felt that people like me needed a warrior to be there for them. I wanted to be that warrior but I simply did not feel like I was capable of the fight. As much as I knew I already was being suffocated, I needed to know I could be there for others. It took me a long time but when I finally found it in me [I have never been more proud to be myself](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1321581036304621568) and to fight for my community. r/Allyship isn't a part-time job. It is like being that warrior I mentioned. It doesn't necessarily mean you're looking for a fight, but you must be ready to go to battle when the time comes. I wasn't ready to fight for myself before. Today, I fight for change.

Twitter certainly was a hotbed after Energy decided to release their ""Official Statement"" affirming their belief that [their hire was the right decision](https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/provocative-dj-dave-wheeler-gets-a-new-mic-572220242.html). There were links and stories and updates and advocates and affirmations from all angles, [even on the other side of the ocean](https://twitter.com/Energy106/status/1298689207955869697). After realizing how many stories and concerns there were, I decided to make my path of advocacy easier to follow, literally, and I did that by [creating a thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1305894111925288961) that sourced everything to follow in one place.

One of the biggest obstacles with advocacy is it often means you're fighting from a weaker position, as in, it's not uncommon for change to be made because of necessity instead of r/morality. When it comes to advocating against corporate boondoggling often change would only ultimately be recognized after corporate partners disagree with the decision and decide to withdraw, and [that's where the adventure really began](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1305900918735425536).

It was fantastic and encouraging to see many corporate allies of the LGBTQ+ community to stand in r/Solidarity with us and denounce the decision made by Energy 106 FM, or more specifically, the Evanov Radio Group. During the unrest it was uncovered that Dave Wheeler was [hired with approval of Paul Evanov](https://i.imgur.com/YascAtG.mp4) himself, which he shared during one of his podcast episodes of Wheeler After Dark.

I still have conflicted feelings about that. How does Paul Evanov, who's father Bill developed the [world's first 100% LGBT front-to-back radio station](https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/radio/cirr-fm), [who passed away on February 28, 2020](http://evanovradio.com/vasil-william-evanov/), personally approve this hire, affirm support by a PR firm (of which I have solid hunches about but am still piecing it together), and be OK with this? Why does Wheeler say in that soundbite that ""they're ready"" now? I can't imagine what the delay would have been, unless we think of crazy supervillain vibes where Paul was waiting for all the legal stuff about Bill to be finished. Dave was unemployed for two years. Was Adam asking Paul to ask Bill to give Dave a job for two years, and now that Daddy's out of the picture Paul can finally be the one to say yes? How does any leadership in an organization that has a globally-accessible r/LGBT-focused radio station that is one of their jewels completely overlook the responsibility of public atonement at a value greater than public shaming, or more accurately disregard its importance? It's completely baffling but truly represents again what life is like with privilege.

I completely understand that Wheeler's termination from his last station [wasn't without controversy](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/dave-wheeler-sues-rogers-92-citi-fm-winnipeg-1.4831614), but what feels like something completely overlooked is that his language was spoken with fluidity. He utilized an opportunity to share unfiltered thoughts AND get paid for it. That's privilege. The idea of being able to speak your beliefs for personal gain with no disregard for hurt or harm: that's privilege.

To get the opportunity to have a public voice again, especially now targeted TOWARDS the demographic who have been harmed by the hateful and dehumanizing speech without any sign of public grief or atonement: that's privilege. To expect forgiveness and acceptance instead of earning forgiveness and trust: that's privilege.

That's why I advocate. The message that your privilege will protect you and anyone lesser has to fight for r/equality continues to be too strong, too frequent, and [too deadly](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/dave-wheeler-fired-trans-comments-1.4751460).

What had me so confused, if not frustrated at the situation, was how the hire didn't raise concerns of transphobia but other forms of discrimination such as racism and sexism as well. One of the most ... eye opening ... experiences was Adam's response to me in one of our meetings where he didn't believe ""[Black Olives Matter](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/wheeler-after-dark-with-dave-c-707535/episodes/196-days-72288477)"" (Starting at \~16:44) was racism. Adam's argument to me was that Dave is a comedian and as such this should be considered a parody. I am not a person of colour by any stretch to know what racism feels like directly, but for him to flatly reject the message that has been spoken LOUDLY by our BIPOC community showed, again, privilege and another reason why I have to keep fighting. What's baffling is that podcast episode with the ""parody"" was uploaded on August 14, 2020 ... only TWO WEEKS prior to Energy's release of their ""Official Statement"" defending their hire. Further examples of racism were brought up by other members of our community, such as [a podcast episode validating Blackface](https://www.buzzsprout.com/194867/3930497-blackface-part-iv?play=true) (starting at \~35:20, released on May 27, 2020, two days after George Floyd was murdered, and with no hesitation to shame the ""woke"" generation), an [anti-Indigenous parody of the Wet'suwet'en protests](https://streamable.com/f3g1xo) on February 21, 2020 (plus referencing to the protest as [looking like an anus](https://i.imgur.com/UB24QlA.jpg)), and [validating police brutality](https://i.imgur.com/TdAbZtK.mp4) to the death of Eishia Hudson (the 16-year-old Indigenous teen who was shot dead on April 16, 2020). He's stated and has been defended that he ""[has done a lot of work](https://www.chrisd.ca/2020/08/24/dave-wheeler-morning-show-energy-106/)"" since getting fired, but I'm struggling to see where it has even started. I am at an absolute loss when it comes to seeing how this history is even close to being welcome at a self-professed LGBTQ+-friendly station, especially considering they fired a woman who was an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community to make space for him and another woman. His personal Wheeler After Dark! podcast explicitly describes the episodes as ""[not intended for those that are easily offended by adult themes, spicy language, satire, dark humour, etc, etc, etc... If you're a kid... You likely shouldn't be listening to this, but you should tell your parents to, they'd find it hilarious!](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-wheeler-in-the-morning-wit-43049197/)""

Being an ally doesn't have on-and-off ""modes."" You can't be a representative of allyship when you're under someone else's watch and especially while under someone else's salary. Allyship is an authentic effort from the heart. It isn't always flawless and it isn't always life-possessing but the motivation has to come from within yourself and it absolutely must represent your honest values. It absolutely stuns me about how Energy 106 FM, and more specifically the Evanov Radio Group, is completely dense to the insensitivity caused by their hire and exceptionally so by standing behind it. [The responsibility of being an ally is not to be taken lightly](https://guidetoallyship.com/), otherwise the actions will be exposed and shown to be [performative activism for personal gain](https://medium.com/illumination/the-difference-between-performative-activism-and-genuine-allyship-c1071133d0e0). As such, I continued (and continue) to advocate. Our minority communities have been run over far too frequently to stand aside to reckless privilege.

A few weeks after it was clear that Energy was firm in their decision, I decided it was time to [get even more involved](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306628473390166016). I was right on the cusp of socially-transitioning to full-time and used that moment as a chapter in my life to [show I'm taking advocating for what's right seriously](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1309278746491273217) and have been on it since. One of my most important processes was identifying business affiliates with the radio group. While it started with raising awareness to direct advertisers and implore them to assess their values, see if they are in line with the decisions at Energy, and withdraw their advertising if they don't support it. Many advertisers pulled which was wonderful to see as support, but I personally had a fire ignited after [I came across a video from Wheeler in the Morning parodying transgender people](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306996490833854464).

The video has since been set to private and in [a meeting I had with Tyler](https://i.imgur.com/OtfZz1S.png) he explained the video was set to private after I called it out because of the aforementioned legal dispute. Regardless, I advised that setting it to private doesn't address the video existing. The message of setting it to private is ""Oh, this is worth keeping, you're not supposed to see it though."" I advised him to have someone on Energy's Twitter account acknowledge my post with that exact remark about legal, to do something that represents anything close to allyship instead of continuing to be deflective and secretive.

Regardless, when I saw that video for the first time, the comments had a description that lit me up more than ever. ""Superheroes... Every last one of 'em.""

[A superhero possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary people, who typically uses their powers to help the world become a better place, or is dedicated to protecting the public, and stopping evil.](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306997230771920904)

[I'm transgender &amp; I am god damned proud of it. I did NOT abruptly become socially &amp; publicly visible to my workplace, sports leagues &amp; peers immediately after the Floyd murder to have Energy's clown car run over MY goal of raising awareness about diversity, inclusion and equality.](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306997691264557056)

Between my parents responding exactly as I expected (who I still have not heard from them to this day, and we're going on about 3m1w at the time of this post), plus Energy and Evanov clearly embracing their decision, my fire has been lit more than ever. This world has never seen as strong as a version of me, and I have barely even teased my potential. I decided that Energy is not enough. If Paul Evanov decided to sign off on it, [Tyler picks up an additional role in the Evanov Radio Group with a segment on the aforementioned radio station PROUD FM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306621705146646528), and zero suggestion they are reconsidering their decisions, I decided the right way to gain awareness was to expand deeper into the radio group. I decided that it was time to [address not only advertisers but any visible business associate](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307355411972980737) with Energy 106 FM, [Hot 100.5 FM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307354292639076353), [CKJS 810 AM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307354599058145280), and PROUD FM.

Ever since I started to advocate on this project, I was close to certain that Energy 106 muted me. If they blocked me I would have seen it, but if they muted me I would have had no idea. However, I realized eventually that Energy [did in fact have the ability to see my mentions and replies the whole time](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307051046372548612). I blocked out what Matt mentioned as sensitivity to his message but it seems he chose to engage it further. He chose to react on a post on Energy's account regarding a pizza promotion, and a picture he used on the post was one of him and his child. [It was Energy's account and I had a question to their promotion sponsor](https://twitter.com/svnflowers_k/status/1307072376081985541), but what ultimately transpired was Matt's wife deciding to ... well, [here](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307043843477471233).

That's not to say that Energy or any accomplices hasn't been aware of my advocacy otherwise. From Day 1 (or as close to it that I can imagine), AJ blocked me for whatever reason but had no problem following a [conversation I had involving a business partner to PROUD FM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1310786943177744384) and [throwing likes to the counterpoints of mine](https://twitter.com/svnflowers_k/status/1310932294425890818). Of course, sometimes the [main account will make accidents too](https://i.imgur.com/9C808yQ.png) but I had no problem capturing it. Why would they continue to be silent when they insist to be ""allies?""

[I am DONE with this world running on hate &amp; dollars instead of heartbeats &amp; common sense. I did NOT abruptly put MY health, MY safety &amp; MY neck on the line inspire change to have Paul Evanov, the Evanov Radio Group, Adam West and Energy 106 FM suggest that being queer isn't profitable enough &amp; try to prove it during a GLOBAL SOCIAL CRISIS.](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307413726358724610)

I feel I have shown with more than enough character and conviction that I know what I'm doing, I know what I'm talking about, and I'm fighting so that we don't need to keep fighting in the future. I advocate strongly for mental health awareness and do my best to engage as much as possible with patience and objective reasoning. I have had people ask if it's OK to come out to me in private messages because they felt there was a safe space. I have had businesses reach out to me about various topics up to and including what could be an appropriate course of action with some of their decisions so that they continue to represent themselves as strong corporate r/allies. I have lost track of the amount of praise, r/gratitude and r/encouragement from so many people in our community. I have had mindful conversations with people immensely frustrated with racism and white supremacy. I have had compassionate conversations with people who want to be allies and are unsure what to do. I have had educational conversations with people about what a trans experience may be like, and I have had many wonderful conversations with trans people of a variety of backgrounds and experiences and shared stories about our journeys. I have had conversations with people who have felt inspired from me, I have had conversations with people who were feeling unwell, and I have had conversations to the point of committing time and awareness with people who were feeling suicidal so that we could get through the moment and work on recovery strategies.

That's not to say that it hasn't been without it's challenges, but has led to some awareness as well! After about a month of constant backlash since sticking to their hire, [Energy posted a podcast episode Tyler did with a local podcast group, Winnipeg's Finest](https://www.energy106.ca/2020/09/30/tyler-carr-has-an-honest-talk-about-energy-106/), which would to me suggest that Energy shares the perspective and sentiments he shared. I felt it was a good opportunity to express frustration about [not being given the opportunity to discuss these changes after being force-told to forgive a transphobic, sexist, racist bigot](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1311281926892695552). The podcast inspired me to respond with a video of my own, as a matter of fact. After [listening to the podcast](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1311367467986378752) a couple of times I decided to [record a YouTube video of my own](https://youtu.be/lZYJyhmwSzQ), completely unfiltered and unedited, pausing at every talking point that contradicted an experience, questioning bias, and so on. The video took me hours! 5 hours, actually! It was my very first time on r/YouTube too! I felt I had no time to waste and took a huge gamble on how it came out but I feel really proud of myself for what I did! I made sure to include [chapter markers of every talking point](https://imgur.com/a/dKMFH7R) as well and ... gosh, there are lots.

Like I said, it hasn't been without its challenges, that's for sure. [Cranking up the advocacy](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307420054280003585) absolutely raised the eyebrows of many for both [good](https://twitter.com/Hoodedarche0/status/1307529836605452289) and, let's call it ""[uneducated](https://twitter.com/TheLadySmoke/status/1307068286421606402)"", reasons. I'm very grateful to be part of a community who helps support each other especially when there is a serious social concern in the works. I feel especially grateful to be a recognizable and trusted person during this entire adventure and I truly would never wish to have taken a different path. Even though I believe that Adam and Tyler only agreed to speak with me out of obligation to a CBSC ""[Complaint re ENERGY 106 CHWE-FM Broadcast](https://imgur.com/a/7NT7eLj)"" (even though it was never addressed as a reason but the timing to start talking and the dis-interest of engaging in r/Zoom conversations when r/COVID19 restrictions ramped up feel incredibly coincidental), I did do my best to be a helpful liaison between the radio station and our LGBTQ+ community. I continued to be engaged and [offered awareness, consultation, advice and concerns via email](https://imgur.com/a/oL0ZEjN). I started and maintained [a thread about what allyship looks like to people and what it would take for them to see Energy 106 FM as an ally](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1313236963995000832) again. For that project alone, I went as far back into relevant time as I could and tried to connect with nearly every user I could find that reacted to Energy 106 FM hiring Dave Wheeler. Loose math from my notes suggests I have tried to connect with about 1600 people. I have personally DM'd about 750 people and every last piece of feedback has been included in the thread. In my [last meeting that I had at Energy](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1318972358711939074), Megan told me that she has been following the entire thread so I at least had an affirmation that the effort has been acknowledged.

Unfortunately, that's also about where it ended. While the start of my emails and correspondence was pleasant and positive communication, it didn't take too long to redirect the focus to some rather important pieces of discussion. It's very clear that since hiring Dave and promoting Wheeler In The Morning as their new morning show, they have enabled a safe space for an extremely far-right culture including [white supremacy, transphobia, racism, and a general disrespect for human decency. There has been stalking, doxxing, libel, cyberbullying](https://imgur.com/a/y6G5WEM) and an absolute maelstrom of right-wing chaos and panic.

What has been incredibly baffling is how Adam and Energy were literally [offered an example of a script to use to stay engaged, not overpromise their direction while denouncing all the values that authentic allies fight against](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1318526814986268679), they decided to ignore all that and ask for everyone to ""[be kind](https://twitter.com/energy106fm/status/1318276615705690114)."" If that doesn't have ""stand back and standby"" written all over it, I don't know what does.

So, this is the part where I ask for r/feedback! I have a few considerations in my mind so far but am curious about where the next part of my journey should go. I know I'm going to continue to raise awareness of the situation to any visible business affiliates, and likely I will up the ante now to all Evanov Radio Group stations from coast to coast. As a matter of fact, I will be including affiliates to the Winnipeg Goldeyes as well because [they censored me when I asked them about their values compared to their affiliation with Energy 106 FM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1320019452772012033). As a trans r/athlete, the simple concept of our local r/AAbaseballteam promoting Diversity Day in the past but censoring me about their values towards diversity, inclusion and equity disgusted me and prompted me to [immediately throw my jersey in the garbage](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1320437091910627328). I will never wear a Goldeyes jersey again, especially so long as they don't respond to my questions.

See, I know what I'm doing is powerful, successful and fearful. Why else would the Wheeler-in-the-Morning-fanclub cry to Twitter to [suspend my account](https://i.imgur.com/CrPLgHp.jpg)? That is arguably one of the most flattering things to come my way, to know that I am the haunting reason for people who are so insecure with themselves they have become possessed and obsessed with my existence, and know they are utterly desperate to silence me during my advocacy about trans rights and fundamentally basic r/humanrights means WHAT I AM DOING IS WORKING AND I WILL NOT QUIT. I must express reservations about Twitter's judgement, however. Oh well. I will earn the blue star, I will be verified, and I WILL bring our trans community to a safer, healthier place.

This cycles back to seeing what feedback is available. I firmly believe these accounts are affiliated to Energy 106 FM or the Evanov Radio Group as a whole. The biggest reason why it comes to mind are based on three things: 1) One of the main antagonists has an account that opened in September 2020, shortly after Dave Wheeler deleted his own account, and [targeted a tweet I commented on](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1309486497591042050). 2) After my last meeting at Energy, Adam affirmed to me that ""he'll take care of them"" when I told him that the little band waving Energy's flag is doing nothing but making his brand look worse, because they are absolutely not doing anything to me. I noticed a near-immediate decline in activity from the fun-club for a small period of time and struggle to believe that wasn't as per Adam's memo. Add the fact that Tyler affirmed to me that he would publicly denounce their behaviour and that has not happened either. So, Energy, Adam, and Tyler have all the means to blatantly denounce white supremacy, harassment, racism, transphobia, r/doxxing, r/stalking, libel, defamation, and so on ... yet completely refuse to. What other option can it be? 3) [This is a little too coincidental](https://twitter.com/svnflowers_k/status/1322208994333741056), and if it was done ""in satire because Dave is a comedian"" (as per Adam) then it shows they are aware of the situation and continue to refuse to address it.

I find it interesting that these accounts have a massive obsession about broadcasting far-right political beliefs and stalking me. Feel free to see for yourself about the obsession since the end of September for all these folks:

I'm sure there are more but if I really wanted to look for Cancer I'd rather go r/stargazing. And frankly, these are simply about things I see directly. I have been told my more than enough peers that this crowd stalks them as well, but peculiarly block those peers if this fun-club doesn't get the reaction they want.

What's especially curious about the situation is that while these users are beyond obsessed with me an have lept over so many lines, I still have no reason to believe that it's not within the Evanov Radio Group and of all things they even have my home address which I needed to include when I wrote my concern to CBSC, so at what point am I to not feel as if Adam or Dave would not use it out of vengeance against me by the time I am done advocating against Evanov Radio Group and their perpetual injustices? People may ask why I shared my address, and the answer is to continue to be open, transparent, and show validity that Energy is a local radio station that is poisoning my local community. People ask why don't I block the aforementioned users, and the answer is because they are not hurting me. Everything that they are doing does nothing but make Energy look worse, make Evanov look like an even more pathetic radio group, and every last itch and twitch they do to try to upset me does nothing but empower me, inspire me, and give me more to work with. Our community has far too many people suffering from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, r/bullying, r/cyberbullying, transphobia, racism, stalking and so much more. I have the means and the mental health strength to absorb all of their hatred and ignorance and show it to people who are in positions to make change that it is happening, it is dangerous and it is deadly. I can not and will not be broken, and that is why I allow these users to continue to try to break me, because all they are doing is making this fire inside of me brighter, stronger, more fierce and ultimately more beautiful. I will not quit.

So, as I've mentioned, I would love to hear your feedback about what you think appropriate courses of action would be! Remember that I'm from r/Canada, from Manitoba to be more specific, so if you have any feedback that is jurisdiction-specific that may be relevant to your consideration!

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! Happy Trans Awareness Week!

"As a cis girl, I'm still pan if I'm in a relationship with a cis guy, right? Why do I feel like I need to look more queer?",CrazyDaisy764,ainbow,"I'm a femme pan cis girl who's had relationships with folx from all over the gender spectrum. I've been with my current partner, who identifies as a pan cis man, for about a year and though I'm quite happy in my relationship, I still struggle with feeling like I'm queer enough or that I'm still part of the lgbtq community. I present pretty femme and got told a lot in high school that ""I didn't look bi/queer"". I guess this insecurity has just made me feel uncomfortable sometimes when I'm with my partner in public or at lgbtq events because people assume that I'm straight based off how my relationship looks from the outside. I don't have a lot of openly lgbtq friends and tho my straight friends are chill, I really hate it when people assume that I'm magically straight again or that I was just experimenting bc I'm with a cis guy. Anyone else feel this? Or am I just weird? I'm happy and comfortable in the way I express myself and my gender and my friends and fam are p chill with my identity so why do I feel pressure to ""look more queer""?? Anyway,  just wanted to know if anyone else feels like this and what to say to idiots who don't understand nonmonosexuality"

I am so tired of pretending I am something I'm not,icecreamchan,ainbow,"First off, this is very personal and it has been really hard for me to type this out and daring to post it.

Nobody might read this but, ever since I was a teenager or so I have felt that I wanted to be a girl. I know that I will never be female no matter what I do. That and being poor and unemployed is making me severely depressed and anxious all the time, the fact that I have to live with others who might judge me for who I want to be (dress feminine) and or work a job where I will be discriminated against makes me cry myself to sleep everynight. I am 23 and feel like I wasted my life already, due to COVID there are no jobs around and everyday I feel worse about it, I just want a simple fulfilling life while being me.  

I have no friends, at all. My family doesn't really give a shit about me. I recently got in touch via Facebook with my old elementary school friends and most of them are doing just fine, having job, girlfriends and still seeing one another from time to time and hanging out. I wish I could have that and be normal and succesful, but I am not.

I am also currently recovering from a disease that I won't go into detail so add that on top of everything and you might see just how miserable I am.

I also like men and women, sometimes I stare awkwardly at people and I fear that they might be able to tell my sexuality or something, which is stupid to think about because people can't read minds. I can't even look people straight in the eye without looking away, or go into places where there are too many people, it's very intimidating. Sometimes I feel scared of acting ""gay"" around people so I put an act of fake macho manliness or alter the way I normally talk so as to not give away how I truly am. I have even said homophobic things when watching TV or some other that really hurt me inside whenever I do because people around me are not exactly progressive so I can't say anything that might ""give me away"". I was even a regular on sites like 4chan /pol/ at one point and posted many hateful things, I just don't know why, guess it must be self hatred.

I bought female underwear the other day and was really scared about it while at the mall, I used the auto-cashier and the assistant came to help me because my card wasn't being read properly and got really scared and stressed about her looking into my cart and seeing a pair of panties. What might she think? I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Once I got home, I realized what I had done and hated myself for it, if I wear this and someones sees it and/or finds it, what will happen?

God, I think that I am too much of a coward to kill myself sometimes but I also don't want to die per se, just the pain to end but it seems like there's no end."

I was 9 years old when my father try to kill me for the first time - Help me to be free and escape from my homophobic parents,LukitaMignon,ainbow,"   trigger warnings - Aggression - Mental abuse - suicide -violence - homophobia  

My name is **Vincent (fake name)** and I was 9 (2011) years old when my father try to kill me for the first time

All starts when he caught me playing with Barbies dolls in my best friends house, he took me by the arm; he held it so tight that when we got home I did not feel my fingertips. Already at home he hit me so much that I didnt feel any more pain, he hit so much that left a scar on my head that carry with me today. The scar was bigger but after years of using ointments to try to erase it, I realize that the scar got smaller but not the pain of the memories.

My father forbade me to see my best friend again

Still 9 years old, I was at my neighbors house, also playing with dolls, I was passionate about playing with dolls, maybe I just wanted to be free like them, but this time I was wearing some makeup, my neighbors mother told my mother, that wait for me to get home to lie me on the bed, take off my shorts and my underwear, took a pair of scissors and put them between my penis while the other hand-held me by the neck, she scream  if youre a fagot tell me now that I cut your dick off since you wont need it anymore while I cry and shouted Stop Mommy please, Im not a fagot, Please Mommy, Please

I was only nine when I knew that the two people who supposed to love and protect me, would kill me if they found out I was Gay, even though I did not know what it was gay at that age

I wish things had stopped here, that I would live happily ever after, but no. aggressions like these continue to happen today.

Two weeks ago my father hanged me until I almost passed out, he caught me watching a James Charles video, he broke my phone and hit me with punches and kicks

I grew up listening jokes and stories about hitting and killing LGBT people who made me think I was wrong for being that way, that made me torture myself inside, made me live my whole life depressed and regretting that people like me should die, be murdered and beaten up just for being Themselves.

When I was 12 years old, I took the worst beating of my life so far

It was late September 2013 a Friday, my father went to get my bimonthly school report card, where the parents go and talk to the teachers. My teacher told my dad that I was hanging out with girls and was acting in a very fagot Way and told him to Fix it.

I was at home when my father came back, he opened the door so hard it made a giant bang and left a hole in the wall where the door handle hit, he picked me up and sat me on a chair in the middle of the Yard and said  so youre acting like a fag ?, I barely had time to say no, it hit my face so hard that my ear was ringing, then he said to me  Ill make you a man now in one way or another so he pushed me off the chair so hard that I fell back, I couldnt even get up, he was already on top of me hitting me with a slipper with the sole made of an extremely hard plastic, while I screamed asking to stop and crawling trying to escape, unsuccessfully. After what I think was 8 minutes hitting me, cursing and humiliating me in many ways, he started punching and kicking me, after the first punches, everything started to get dark and I just remember flashes of him hitting me and yelling at me, and one of the flashes I remember was me asking my mom for help and she just looking at everything doing nothing. After that, I passed out and only woke up almost 10 hours later. I was full of abrasions and bruises all over my body, I was so hurt that I was unable to go to school for a week, because I was in pain for about 5 days and because no one could know that I had beaten.

Two weeks after that I still very shaken by everything that happened, and after reliving all the worst moments of my life, after realizing that I would never be free to be whom I really am, that I would have to live hiding the real me, or I could end up being killed by my Family I made a decision.

Therefore, when I was 12, I tried to kill myself for the first time.

Biden and Harris' victory gave me the strength to stop hiding and ask for help, and you can help me.with your help i will be able to get my passport, get my visa, my ticket and pay a lawyer to help me with my asylum applicationI will do everything hidden with the help of a friend so that my parents cannot stop me and arrest me once and for all here in Brazil what I'm asking for is just a chance to be able to live free, truly with who I am, you who are reading this can walk without fear, without having to think a thousand times before saying something, how will you walk, I can't, today I identify myself as a QueerGender person but unfortunately I have to live totally in the male, I don't even know what it's like to be able to live as I want, there are so many things I want to do, I need my freedom, I need a place where I can be who I am.

I want to go to america, live my life without fear, dress like I want, be able to wear wigs, be able to wear pink, be able to fall in love, love who I want, walk with my bag through the streets without fear, I want to be able to study to be a doctor , it has always been my dream, I want to work without hiding who I am, I WANT TO BE FREEPlease, Please give me this chance, I deserve to be Happy, I deserve to be free"

Why so hateful?,m0llusk,ainbow,"Someone posted a pride graphic that was rendered in shades of grey.  I didn't get their point and asked in the comments if it was a Fifty Shades of Grey thing thinking that was a good guess and at worst mildly amusing.  That comment got a huge number of downvotes.  Oddly enough, I'm still confused about the original post and the negative reaction.  Because it was buried in downvotes and no one bothered to explain I still don't understand.

Then there was a thread about gender identity and questioning and I made a joke that I thought was clearly absurd that attempted to poke fun at the ridiculous ""attack helecopter"" thing that has been going around.  In response I was given a message that I have violated the hate rule here.  What?!  If you can't make fun of that idiocy, then what kind of closed board do you have?  

I have been and out and politically active since 1986.  I strongly support all gender and sexual identities including questioning and asexual who still get a lot of misunderstanding.  When people talk of LGBTQ I insist that the ""I"" for Intersex be included because roughly 1 out of 1000 are born Intersex and should be acknowledged and celebrated like everyone else.  I have done years of hard work protesting, writing letters, having arguments with people to advance rights for people, and now you want to squelch and silence me because I made a joke about haters that you didn't like?  Shame on you!  You have made yourselves into an angry and exclusive club that actively fights against people you should be allied with.

The ""attack helicopter"" thing in particular is perniciously stupid and needs to be called out.  If a joke about that bothers you then you should be able to engage conversation and explain why.  Trying to cut anyone who doesn't talk like you out of the forum isn't going to work out the way you want.  Indeed, it is that kind of carrying on that led to r/ainbow getting so much traffic that used to be on other subreddits.  I'm going to keep doing what I think should be done to advance human rights for all and that absolutely includes jokes that imply the ""attack helicopter"" thing is just plain dumb."
Being male sucks. (For me at least),CuddlyRainbow,ainbow," Its time for me to talk about something and i dont know where else to this but here. First of: This isnt going to be a post in the format of: BeInG a MaLE iS haRD tOO, pleASe leT me feEL suPresSeD. No peeps. In this post you are going to have the joy of watching a white cis male squirming around in his own shit. Despicable. Truly.

I should also inform you, that i have some heavily internalised misandristic tendencies i am sometimes unaware off, so i should also apologise to all the men out there reading this. Okay? Okay.

Now to get started: I never was quite the normal boy when i grew up and people let me feel that. You know, boys will be boys. So if some of them bully another boy into almost killing himself it must be fine right? Right?

Nevertheless now i life in a world, where my own gender has rejected me, so what to do? For most of my life the answer was simple: Prove them wrong. Be the best man possible, be better than them. That send me of on a quest to achive something im clearly not set up to. To be a manly man. And people told me that. I always had this clash between my introspection and the way others saw me and it hollowed me out. I submitted to the toxic masculinity. I became i shitty person, who tried to force other people into giving me the recognition that i craved, ignorant that other kinds of recognition where happyly offered to me.

And i have done horrible things in my quest for manhood. I lied to my friends. I threatened woman, who rejected me with suicide. I objectified them. I adopted some incel esk worldviews. Thank god i wasnt so active in the internet that time. Because i would have doven head first into their toxic swamps of horribleness, just to get a perverted version of self gratification.

Its been 3 years now, since i figured out i was bisexual and started to question traditional gender roles, thanks to some feminist friends of mine who took very good care of me. I owe them who i am today to be honest. Even though what i am today is a husk of a human being but its better than being a biggot tbh.

The problem is, where i once was intoxicated by my pursuit towards toxic masculinity and female recognition, i now have next to nothing to strive towards. In the feminist/leftist discorse which i am happyly a part of btw, dont get me wrong, man are either toxic and dangerous or they are... What exactly? The left doesnt have a positive ideal of manhood and that would be fine wouldnt it be for the fact than woman spaces exist.

Hear me out: Most of my close friends are woman. I love them deeply and i cant imagine a life without them. But i can never shake the feeling that they have something, that i dont. It is most likely idealisation from my part, but woman seem so much better than men to me. They are beautiful, they are desired, they can show kindness without being looked at in a weird way. They can enjoy cute things without being called gay. (Like i am on the regular) I think it all just boils down to me egoistical wish to be desired. I want to feel pretty too. But i cant. Because there is this thing called pop culture. And it tells me, that man arent pretty at best, they are buff and i dont want to be buff. I want to be pretty, but i am ugly. I want to be desired, but i am lonely. I want to have something to identify with, something to aspire to, but there is nothing. I am nothing.

I am a man. So i am nothing."

How can I make my breast smaller?,jumpsuit13,ainbow,"I hate my breasts always have. For years I had small ones. Until I got pregnant and breast fed. Then they shrunk again when I stopped breast feeding and I was fine. Then, I was prescribed this antidepressant that made me gain weight and they got bigger again. I am actively trying to lose weight, quit the antidepressant, but they still too big to strap down. I hate this. If I had the money I  would get them removed. Are there any other ways to reduce breast size aside from losing weight? I am impatient and insecure. I am purposely being very vague and quick with the question because a part of me feels ashamed. Long story but I am a female with breasts and have hated them my whole life. They used to be small now big, losing weight is taking too long, I can't afford to get them removed what can I do? When I strap them down you can still tell they are there. I hate my body. Is there a pill I can take to make them smaller? I am so serious. My breasts have caused me so much inner turmoil."
Should I act on feelings I have for a girl even though Ive recently started questioning my sexuality?,Throwawayyy123451,ainbow,"A couple of months ago I started questioning my sexuality. I always thought I was 100% straight, but then I discovered gay p0r n. I was way more into it than straight. Then, after that discovery I started finding the same-sex attractive... I definitely have a type though. 

But theres this girl... Ill try keep the back story short: we met 2 years back in college and instantly became friends. She was seeing someone at the time. She would talk to me about wanting to break up. She broke up. We got really close, but I never had the courage to act on my feelings... I waited too long and some other guy came a swooped her away from me. 

Now back to recently: At a small get-together before college started she told me she doesnt like this guy she is with, she went on to say that she has never met someone like me, she wants to be able to laugh in a relationship she wants someone like m- I quickly cut her off before she could say anything cause my anxiety was through the roof. Afterwards We ran away from the small party and lay in a moon-lit field watching the night sky, listening to fine line over and over again... cheesy, yes I know, but that moment was perfect, and it just keeps replying in my head over and over. Now that Italy (where Im living at the moment) is pretty much back in lockdown, weve being texting back and forth quite a bit, but not just normal texting like friends do, no Im talking about deep conversation texting... I know that I love her, but I dont know if my body will let me love her. I dont want to lead her on nor do I want to ruin the great friendship we have. But I do, I love her. 

Im really hoping Im straight, or bi. I know that sounds bad. But I really want to make it work with her."

Bid reminder that Marsha P. Johnson was neither a trans woman nor the one who started the Stonewall riots and we should not erase our history for the sake of this misconception.,The_PJG,ainbow,"I don't get how this misconception has gotten so far or why so many people believe it, but  Marsha P. Johnson was a gay cis man who was also a transvestite, aka a cross dresser aka not a transgender woman. 

Johnson was interviewed, on June 26th, 1992, nine days before her death. Johnson refers to herself throughout as a drag queen, a boy a gay, a homosexual, and a transvestite. The word transgender is not mentioned by Marsha, who also discusses other queens, but not herself, taking hormones in the 60s. The interview is featured in the 2012 documentary [Pay It No Mind: Marsha P. Johnson.](https://vimeo.com/41327842)

She is also credited with starting the Stonewall riots with Sylvia Rivera, giving life to the idea that trans people of colour started the gay rights movement and that we would't be anywhere without them. This is just plain wrong. Marsha herself stated [in an interview](https://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/episode-11-johnson-wicker/) that she wasn't there at Stonewall when the riots started.

 

&gt;***Marsha****: The way I winded up being at Stonewall that night, I was having a party uptown. And we were all out there and Miss Sylvia Rivera and them were over in the park having a cocktail.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I was uptown and I didnt get downtown until about two oclock, because when I got downtown the place was already on fire. And it was a raid already. The riots had already started. And they said the police went in there and set the place on fire. They said the police set it on fire because they originally wanted the Stonewall to close, so they had several raids. And there was this, uh, Tiffany and, oh, this other drag queen that used to work there in the coat check room and then they had all these bartenders. And the night before the Stonewall riots started, before they closed the bar, we were all there and we all had to line up against the wall and they was all searching us.*

 Marsha, in her own words, did not throw the first shot glass. And Rivera, according to Johnson, wasnt even there.

Who started the Stonewall riots then? While there is no 100% certain answer, one of the most likely candidates is a butch lesbian by the name of Storm DeLarverie. Multiple sources agree that she began putting up a fight with police as she was dragged from the bar, and agree that this event sparked the throwing of objects, such as money, cobblestones, bricks, and shoes.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that this entire misconception has been spread so far is almost criminal and a complete erasure of our history and of the lesbian woman who actually should be getting credit for all of this. In case anyone is curious [here is an article](https://sue-donym.medium.com/stonewasnt-a7f82a372d50) I found that disects everything pretty well.

&amp;#x200B;

So TL;DR: Marsha P. Johnson was not a transgender woman, she didn't start the Stonewall riots, and the person who most likely did was a butch lesbian by the name of Storm DeLarverie. Spread the word."

Is the trans community the same way TERFs are towards them?,Kaiqin7,ainbow,"I have had bottom dysphoria for a long time and I want to transition by having a sex reassignment surgery, but at the same time I dont feel comfortable as a woman or non-binary. I  would be basically both trans (by transitioning) and man (by identifying as one even after sex reassignment surgery), not sure if I would be the same as a AFAB trans man, but still. I made a post about this and I was told ""go to a psychiatrist"", so basically calling me crazy for having gender dysphoria the same way TERFs do to them, ""trans men want to have a penis and being a trans man is not about having a vagina"" which is exactly what terfs and truscum say, some trans men dont want  to have a penis and I never said being a trans man is about having a vagina, it is about having a gender identity different from your sex which is exactly what I would be if I had the sex reassignment surgery and had an F in my documents while identifying as a man. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly feel attacked and think that the trana community should take a good look at themselves because they are doing to me exactly what TERFs do to them, acting as if I am not valid only because they dont understand how I feel! I feel like a trans man trapped in a cis man's body and not even the trans community seems to understand what I am going through!"

Im recruiting participants for a study about peoples understanding of their own gender + sexuality, and their experiences with the ideas others hold about their group. This two-part research study is called Community Interviews (STU00213154), and includes a one-hour long video-recorded research interview with me as well as a brief online follow up survey. This data is being collected for research purposes and your information will be treated as confidential. Participants will be compensated $25 for their time, via a digital gift card of their choice. 

I am recruiting (1) people who identify as transgender or otherwise gender-nonconforming (for example: transgender people, non-binary people, agender people, any identification or experience within the trans\* umbrella) and (2) people whose sexuality is neither heterosexual nor homosexual (for example: bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer, etc). Participants must be between the ages of 18 and 40, living in the US, and able to complete both parts of the study (interview &amp; survey).

This study is designed to directly incorporate the voices + experiences of members of the BTQ+ community into the development of social theory. Im doing this work as a psychology graduate student at Northwestern University, under the supervision of my advisor, Dr. Doug Medin.

How do I be more comfortable in expressing my sexuality through how I dress in public?,marv9512,ainbow,"As a gay man I've been out of the closet for two years now and still feel uncomfortable wearing pride shirts and painting my nails which I love to do in private. Coming out was really hard for me because I had known I was gay since I was a young teenager but never told anybody. I never even dated until I was 22 and that's when I told my family. I've always been a very private person, not sharing any of my personal life with most people, not having many friends. And I've been happy being so unsocial because that's just the kind of person I am. Except now I've been out for two years and I'm tired of always feeling self-concious the few times I leave the apartment wearing nail polish or even putting a pride sticker on my car. I want to be more vocal about who I am, but living in the south (NC) it's so out of the ordinary for many people. Especially the town I live in.

"I (20) get really upset whenever my mother calls me a ""woman"" or describes me in that way. [RANT] [OPINIONS NEEDED]",izakayasan,ainbow,"My mom throughout my whole life has always been really supportive, but she's always said things that kind of put me off. When I was 12-13 years old, I wanted to wear men's deodorant and clothes, and she said I couldn't, ""because they're for men."" She actually threatened to punish me if she ever caught me wearing men's body spray. This hasn't ever sat well with me, because I had to fight for my right to feel comfortable in my own body around her. At such a young age I had to save up pocket change to buy underwear that made me feel comfortable, and buy products that I liked. 

My mom has recently tried to become a bit more ""woke"" about LGBTQ+. I came out as gay when I was in highschool, and now, I'm just existing. I don't really care who or what I like, I have no boundaries at all and I'm happy in my own skin. My mom is of course very accepting, but she just doesn't quite understand that it isn't her job to ""get"" LGBTQ+. I've had to explain myself and the community to her for many years because she just doesn't understand it, and I had enough a while ago. She's learned a lot about gender identity on her own and what it means to be LGBTQ+, but she's still very cishet about it. You know what I'm talking about. They try to ""straight-splain"" you sometimes, and it's very annoying.

Anyways. Whenever my mom tells me I'm becoming such a ""beautiful young woman"" I just get very uncomfortable and upset. I've always been a tomboy. I've never identified as being a woman. I hate that word a lot, to be honest, because of its association to not only her, but many people. I'm not a cook or a maid, I hate kids and don't want to have them, and I have no interest in liking ""girly"" things because that's what my sex specifies I should like. I don't like that word one bit. I can be myself without having to be called a woman. I'm a person. 

Just today, I was telling her about how the flannel I'm wearing always gets tight in the shoulders when I lift my arms. It isn't buttoned up, so it's not really because of my chest. She says ""It's because you're built like a woman. Women and men are just built differently. You aren't shaped like a man. You're a woman wearing mens clothes, it makes sense."" I've heard this before, but it always manages to upset me. I'm not shaped like a woman. I just have curves. All sorts of people have curves, not just women. And just because I am female, does not mean that I can't wear what I like. I wasn't trying to ask for your opinion, I was trying to tell you something trivial. I hate the way she just.. kind of pokes and prods at my identity whenever she says this type of thing? It's almost like because I'm not a man, I can't have anything to do with it? I hate the way she uses the words man and woman like that. The world is more than just men and women, and a majority of people just don't fit into these standards of hers. And some clothes fit people with curves, some fit people with more square bodies. I just happen to like the styles of the latter more. 

I appreciate her trying to understand me and people like me by reading about what it means to be LGBTQ+. I appreciate her supporting me in any way that she can, but there's just some things that my cishet mom says that won't ever sit well with me, and I guess I'd just like to hear anyone else's opinion on this type of behavior. I've never really known what to do with these feelings, or how to even try and tell her that it bothers me, because she won't get it. Please, let me know your thoughts if you've read this far.

Paid Research Opportunity on LGBTQ+ mental health,LGBTQ_study,ainbow,"  Hello, 

My name is Amy, I'm a psychology doctoral student doing research on LGBTQ+ mental health. It's incredibly difficult to gather LGBTQ+ participants in a college setting so I'm turning to reddit for some help. 

If you would like to participate, please fill out the screener survey! (Link at the bottom). I appreciate any and all who apply. If you have any questions, also feel free to message me!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atk9rqho4ay51.jpg?width=1750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85bbe4c5313dd9efe390ae122b3338d35b4d6776

Are you between 18  26 years old? Do you identify as part of the LGBTQ+? Do find yourself using social media frequently throughout the day? Have you been diagnosed with anxiety and/or depression? 

If so, we are looking for people to participate in a 60  90 minute small group discussion about their experiences on social media. Discussions will take place on Zoom through video and will be audio recorded. 

Because LGBTQ+ youth are a vulnerable group who are more susceptible to depression and anxiety, and whose social media habits are understudied, the purpose of this study looks at the experiences of LGBTQ emerging adults who frequently use social media regarding both their mental health and how it affects their online experiences. 

Participants will receive a $10 gift card at the end of each focus group. 

**To Participate**

Please follow the link below to a quick survey. You will be contacted through the phone number you provide at the end.

Gay/Bi-sexual resources (Canada),Ex_lurrker,ainbow,"Hello LGBTQ+ Redditors, I need your help. Someone very close came out to me today, for privacy sake I won't mention any details as he is not publicly out yet. I am so proud of him and happy that he came out to me. He mentioned his uncertainty about if he is completely into guys or if he is bi-sexual. He is struggling to find his identity within his sexuality. I suggested that he find a community or group of people who better understand what he is going through to help him work through some of the questions he has. As a straight male I have no idea what is out there for him. I was wondering if any of you had suggestions about some books or resources that could help him work through his identity. We are in Canada if that changes what websites or resources are available. Any resources I could pass on to him would be much appreciated. He does not have Reddit. Thanks for your help!"

How do I help my daughter with her questions about chest binders?,hispansky,ainbow,"My daughter just turned 13, the last couple months she has been making comments/jokes about being my son. I have 4 kids, 3 girls and 1 boy, so the boy we have pretty much always called son. Even his friends call him that (hes a third so calling him by name gets confusing). But as of this summer when I call out hey son my daughter will respond. So I have tried to only call him by name. 
Last night she asked me where do you buy chest binders? Initially I just responded that I dont know but Ill look into it. Afterwards I talked with her about it and reminded her that if she is seriously interested in it then I have no problem looking into binders for her. She stated I dont think Im trans but some days I want to be a boy and some days I want to be a girl. 
So my question is: where do I go for accurate information to help her with this? And where can she go or how does she get a better understanding of herself. I know she is still young but I want to provide her with the safety and support to explore herself. Her dad is not understanding and a bit of a bully, so I worry she may try to hide things."

Johnny Weir Could Use Your Votes,Accomplished-Bid-373,ainbow,"Listen, I try not to stump where I shouldn't so I've never posted anything here about my current reality show obsession. For the past couple of months I've been supporting retired figure skater Johnny Weir on the US reality show Dancing with the Stars. He's gay and has been out for over 10 years. Since being on the show he's been subjected to hateful online rhetoric from people who seem to have just realized that he's gay. He's been so diplomatic in his responses but it infuriates me that something completely outside of his control is being used against him to try and put him down. He even got flack and lost followers for being joyful about the outcome of the recent election. Again, I try not to stump where I shouldn't but if anyone here has time on their hands and is willing to support him I encourage you to vote him into the finals. He dances every Monday night. The competition is nearly over and every vote counts (where have we heard that before)! I can't think of a better way to silence the haters then by winning the whole thing.

What is my sexual orientation?,DG_1194,ainbow,"Before I get the we cant tell you, only youd know, I have taken tests and certainly internalized quite a bit. Im in my mid twenties and never had a real romantic relationship. Ive had sex but never gave a blow job, honestly the idea disgusts me and Id rather not. I find men and women good looking but I would not date a woman, I wouldnt mind the possibility of kissing a woman etc. Im just asking for feedback, I get teased for being bisexual because I call women hot all the time and look at women. But while I am likely straight, part of me wonders if I am asexual. Maybe I havent met the right one? The point Im getting to is Im disgusted by blowing someone &amp; do not masturbate. Ive tried &amp; it does nothing for me. I fantasize sexual situations but thats it, honestly, I find sex overrated and kind of dirty. Not repulsive, Im not religious (brought up Catholic now Atheist) but the act of it is very filthy."
"I need help confronting my mom so that I'm not kicked out of my home. Any advice, or insight, is helpful.",throwaway2063953951,ainbow,"**Context:** *(feel free to skip to the part where I need advice if you want)* I've come out to my parents already in 2018, at the time I was 15, and it didn't go well. Since then, we've constantly been struggling about my identity for a while. For some info on me, I knew I was explicitly transgender since I was 11. I began to transition slightly by the age of 12, where I started to cut my hair, change my name, and come out to close friends. By the time I reached freshman year (I came out the summer after), I told all my teachers and the school administration, with no problems. They accommodated for me, and also respected the fact that I was not yet out to my parents. Since I've come out, they've been aware they my parents have not been accepting and are still very helpful. 

**Advice:** I turned 18 in September, and I intend to transition medically. I've been in contact with a transgender support center, where they will help me get started with my medical transition. I'm gonna tell my mom that I'm transitioning, whether she likes it or not, but obviously in the form of a respectful conversation. I don't want to get kicked out. I need help in what to tell her, this article https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/1546527001 pretty much PERFECTLY describes how she feels, in fact, it could've been almost written by her (it's written by a mom from a town I live 30 min away from, the only difference is I'm not autistic). How do I counteract this sort of thinking?

Thank you so much to anyone who helps."

we need a new study on the intersection between being trans and neurodivergent,nada_rat,ainbow,"There was one done in 2014 but it was ableist. They didn't ask the trans neurodivergent kids, but instead their parents. Things such as 'do they really understand the affects of being trans?' were asked. This is all I know about the study right now, but if anyone knows more please lmk. The new study should be done by and for trans neurodivergents. No one understands us like ourselves, even people who are supposed to be specialized in these topics don't, because no one involves the people it concerns. To me, that feels like saying the people it concerns are less then, incompetent. I expect the study will get backlash, probably ableist things about how the people running the test aren't neurotypical so they can't be capable of doing as much. Probably transphobic things about how it's made to brainwash people. Idk but it's an important study."
Am i bi,sadhamhussian1,ainbow,"I didnt know where else to post this sorry if this wrong to post here 
I (20M)  have for many years believed i was straight   however im not quite sure anymore. (Warning this will be crude). As i said believed i was straight man. But recently my new partner(22F) suggested  pegging (i have always considered this but have been to afraid to ask, any other of my previous partners and i have tried anal play by myself before.) I said yes of course and I enjoyed it a lot and it got me thinking, and now ive come to the conclusion  that i  have found some men attractive but the thought of them inside me repulses me however i would suck their dick. Does this make me bi?

tl;dr like pegging and anal play, dont want a real dick in me, find some guys attractive and would suck a dick.  Does this make me bi?"

3. Did you have some changes on the perception of your ideal types? As in, did your ideal partner characteristics change?

Does Being Attracted To Trans Girls Make Me Bi?,discardedexistence,ainbow,"So I guess I'll preface with saying that I don't really believe in the labels for sexuality anyways. 

I think you're just attracted (or not attracted) to whatever you feel attracted to, and you don't really have any control over that. 

Having said that I understand they exist so people can have something to relate to or find common ground with others like them. 

I just think it's silly to label someone about it, because it's just like, you like what you like. So I suppose the Kinsey scale kind of makes sense to me in that regard?

I guess you're wondering why I'm even asking this then if I don't care to label these things. 

The majority of me doesn't care, but the other part of me is kind of in shock? I never once felt attracted to a man, but then I stumbled across a really pretty girl online and... well she ended up having a dick much to my chagrin lol. 

That just opened up the flood gates and I've found myself really liking trans girl porn lately? At first I felt ashamed but now it doesn't really bother me at all.

The thing is, I *know* I'm attracted to it because of their feminine features. Pretty face, (some of them are even somehow curvier than non-transwomen???), smooth skin, etc. BUT... ^^I really like their dicks too?

I don't know, because I'm attracted to them because of how feminine/pretty they look, but the dick just kind of adds this insane thrill/exhilaration to it? 

Like it almost feels like I'm doing something I feel like I'm not supposed to do. So it's a similar thrill to messing around with someone in public if that makes sense? Or when you were younger and first starting having sexual experiences like kissing etc.

But now I'm at the point to where if I find a pretty trans girl I'm almost like... excited to see their dick?

And that just makes me feel so indescribably conflicted lol.

I honestly feel like I'll get downvoted for this post, and it's probably been asked here before. But idk man, I just don't have anyone to talk to about it in real life and it's something I've been thinking about for the past several months now. Just kind of wanted to vent I guess. 

I have talked to a couple cute t-girls now and I know that neither of them consider it to be gay, because hey, they're girls at the end of the day. But like, please can anyone relate to me here? I've identified myself as a non-questioning straight cis male my entire life, so this is just a really crazy feeling for me. I still feel somehow guilty about it. I haven't been able to talk to anyone about it.

I know that this is totally normal and I'm expecting all the ""stop wasting our time you're not gay or bi"" comments but I don't know it seems like a good place to post? /r/offmychest is not always the best place for venting these days if you've been on the sub. 

Like okay, if I have a sexual desire to play with a trans girls genitals does that make me bi? I have never felt attracted to the anatomy of a male body, or a male face. I can tell when a guy is attractive, but I feel like that's normal. It's easy to pick out attractive facial features in humans. 

However I have felt attracted to some of these trans girls' dicks and that's why I don't really know how to feel about all this lol 

I will say (and I hope none of this sounds offensive, I'm sorry I'm trying to be as tactful as possible I just don't know how else to describe it) I'm only attracted to the really feminine looking trans girls? Like when you would never have even been able to guess that they were trans? The femboy thing or any other masculine features kind of turn me off immediately. But a girl with a dick? That's WOW to me lol

Honestly as I'm typing this I realize I'm probably just overthinking this... but I didn't know if I should just treat this as a kink because it feels kind of demeaning to call trans girls a ""kink."" That's like when white women fetishize black men or white men fetishize asian women for example."

As a preface, if I was in any swing state this conversation would not be happening, as I would vote for Biden in that case. But my state is one of the bluest in the entire country and has no chance of going Trump.

So they told to reveal who, and they said if I didnt theyd tell everyone I know that Im a trump supporter and theyd spread bad rumors about me throughout the city 

So I told them Im voting Green this year because Bidens platform wasnt progressive enough on healthcare and the environment.

They said that if I go through with it theyd actively try to ruin my life and reveal deeply personal secrets I told them to everyone they knew and they will never stop trying to humiliate me.

I'm really trying to understand. I'm not trying to attack or anything. If anything I'm trying to change my beliefs. Please read.,MaxK1234B,ainbow,"Okay, I'm genuinely trying to understand. I am desperately not trying to sound bigoted or exclusionist, and I apologise if I do, the point of this is that I'm trying to get better about that and maybe overcome it. I'm trying to understand, not attack. 

I think the reason so many other people in the LGBTQ+ community are a little adverse to ace/aro inclusion is that (please correct me if I am wrong) never in pretty much any constitution or world government has it been illegal to be asexual, and people don't get harassed on the street, or beaten up, or assaulted, or killed for being aro/ace. There are no slurs for aro/ace, walking around a public place while being aro/ace isn't visible at all, and there are generally no consequences for being aro/ace. Is this true? Is this reasonable? I understand that they still do not fit under the cis/hetero/allosexual normative society, but a cis, hetero, white, aro/ace male faces pretty much no discrimination or lack of liberties and rights that a cis, hetero, white, allo male does. Again, please correct me if I am wrong about these or overlooking things, I do believe that aro/ace people exist, I'm not denying their sexuality, I just kind of understand why many people are exclusionist based on the vast differences of experience. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, and I'm genuinely trying to understand, not attack. I'm open to anything."

Writing a novel. Small excerpt. Please critique: Theme/Flow/Quality. Is it an interesting read? Please tell. Thanks!,jacksansjill,ainbow,"***Jack's Offshore***

&amp;#x200B;

 The blue and white Bell Jet Ranger helicopter was closing on the oil rig, 80 miles into the green choppy sea off Port Fourcon, Louisiana. Jack told himself he *wasnt going back offshore again.* *Ever.* Yet, here he finds himself, accepting another hitch  not on the platform hes flying to, but on the one-hundred-forty foot supply boat tied up to it. Twenty-eight days on - fourteen off.

Although his experience on resupply vessels would likely secure him a better-than-good shot at a lucrative position on a platform, Jack knew it was too much of a *career* for him. Too much responsibility. These rig companies would constantly ask him go to this school - to acquire new skills, and go to that school - for a new certification. Thoughts of it found his motivation on the floor. Plus, theyd want him to do things, many things, which if done incorrectly, could result in loss of life or limb. The boat was plenty dangerous, but he was an independent contractor there. Deckhands were the lowest paid workers in the industry, and that was just alright with Jack. He was by no means stupid  he just wanted to do stupid work.

Along with Jack and the pilot, were two rig-operators and a roustabout. None spoke during the entire thirty-five minute flight.

As the chopper banked for the approach, the roustabout vomited into a bag handed out by the pilot before take-off.

*Cant even handle the helicopter ride. Sorry bastard -* Jack thought to himself.

Jack knew from past experience, this young guy was going to have a hard time on the rig. Rig guys and boat guys are not the same when it comes to motion sickness. Most boat guys can go through almost any sea and still keep their lunch. Not so with rig guys. They suffer. Even though oil platforms look stationary from a distance, they sway terribly in heavy seas.

As the skids beneath the helo where touching down, Jack was already longing to be back in the gay bars of the French Quarter. Everything from the big dance clubs to the hole-in-the-wall spots. He thrived in that environment. Jack wasnt attracted to the men in this flying box  not even a little bit  but he loved being wanted by the men in those bars. Hed been heavily desired by beautiful women his whole life - slept with plenty of them - but none could equal the ravenous intensity of unfamiliar gay men in heat. Jack found that a section of the gay men in the Quarter werent looking for love behind the eyes. To these men, Jack was a hologram-come-to-life, which presented no option to give love and introduced no requirement to be loved.  

Jack comes in from offshore with a fat twenty-eight day paycheck waiting, catches a Greyhound bus to New Orleans, and pays for two weeks in a cheap hotel. Sometimes, he gets so excited, he puts his off-shore bag in a coin-pay locker in the bus station and heads to the bars in the same dirty work clothes and knee-high rubber steel-toed boots he stepped off the boat in. There's been times when he never went back for the bag and had to be completely re-outfitted again, sans the boots. He wanted to be yearned for, and fast.

As he approaches any gay bar, his routine is to take off his shirt, tie it around his waist and step inside. Jack has a swimmers build mid-section with arms much larger than had ever been seen on any swimmer. Just past six foot tall, his overall appearance is striking. Thirty-six years old and solidly developed. Strong chin and wispy blonde hair, like that of a young Iowa corn farmer. Father-time will never move his amazing hairline.

Shirtless, he enters an establishment, steps to the bar and orders a beer. This will be the last drink hell purchase all night. Generally, ""Queer as Folk"" or some other LOGO programming is on the big screen behind the bar. Better off alone, Cher's ""Believe,"" or Beyonce's ""Baby Boy"" is bumping from the house speakers. It wont be long before some older gentleman comes up to talk. Sometimes, theyll reach around and grab his crotch first  and then talk. The attractiveness of these men was of no consequence. It wasnt about looks. Any man will do. They just have to lust after him.

He favors the older men because they carried with them a certain desperation. All the better, as it added to their desire that they might capture him. A sensual *rush of expediency* emanated from them - almost a panic which just wasnt present in the younger guys. For each, he was the Big Fish. Perhaps, a last chance at excellence in a lover. Plus, most of the older gentlemen are at a point in their lives where they're financially well-off. Many reside in Uptown New Orleans, occupying large Victorians - or they own a place in the French Quarter. Some live Uptown and hold a second place in the Quarter, just for guys like Jack. Either way, they have play-money. The bulk of these men where wealthy beyond everyday concerns. Jack cared little about their money, but it did make things easier. No worries about splitting the check in a bar or restaurant. No concern about paying for anything at all. On occasion, a random opulent tourist would whisk Jack away to a suite in one of the pricier hotels. No matter if it was a local bottom or a tourist, jack just wanted to get their legs on his shoulders and drive.

He often looks into their eyes during intercourse, wondering what kind of lives these men have led. Are they good men? Do they have family close by or were they solo like him? Would he be the dream they expected? If so, would they try to keep him? Some have begged. He never loses his erection during these ponderings.   

In the gay community, Jack is whats considered a power-top. He just might be considered a prostitute also. Jack prefers to top. Hes bottomed before, but it didnt do much for him, other than make him aware of the constant throbbing sensation in his colon in the hours that followed. Hes given some blowjobs too, every one of them to orgasm  - but his head doesnt naturally desire to go down there. Legs-on-shoulders is Jacks favorite position, but some arent able to do that, be they obese, perhaps from the excesses of beignets and gumbo - or just too damned old. These men have to sit on top or take it from behind. For those who can't do well with - or aren't interested in intercourse - giving Jack a blowjob works nicely. No matter the position or circumstance, Jack will be the Alpha.

The chopper came to a rest on the helo-pad on the far right quadrant of the oil platform. The pad is designed for just this kind of personnel exchange. As the helicopter door swung open, Jack realized he'd been throbbing hard for most of the flight, but was now returning to flaccid. A quick glance underneath of his dark safety glasses revealed a small spot of precum. The viscous fluid had pushed its way through his underwear and gray coveralls. Although soft now, he knew he'd continue to leak for another ten minutes. Maybe no one would notice.  

You fellas enjoy! the pilot yelled from a mouth framed with aviator glasses and an ear-muffed headset.

Jack and the others grabbed their large offshore bags, donned their hardhats, and stepped down onto the rig. Near a large, rusty yellow crane, three men were waiting for the chopper-cabin to clear so they could embark.

Jack stooped low and scooted clear of the whirling blades, traversing down a single set of metal steps. He set the over-sized duffel bag down on the abrasive non-skid surface and waited for further instruction.

Sunshine beamed with what felt like added strength. The Gulf breeze was amazing. Peering up past the cold steel, to the soft blue sky, Jack imagined most people would consider what he was experiencing  dreamy. A delight.

Just then, a door behind him opened. Jack turned. A large, burly, middle-aged man wearing green coveralls and a white hardhat stepped into Jacks dream.

Hello Jack! Mike Rogers said with a grin.

Mike Jack replied firmly

They shook hands. Jack wasnt much on small-talk.

Hows Mary and the kids? he asked.

Marys alright, but that damned son of mine is going to drive us mad. Three stints in rehab, and here we go again. This whole thing is breaking Marys heart. Dog died last week and works slowing out here. I see the plot of a country song building! he laughed, his voice rising up and out of the gloom.

How long you out here for this time? Mike asked

Twenty-eight. Jack responded. Thats what they tell me anyway. I got fucked last time out. My relief never showed up to the office in Houma, and I had to do his twenty-eight too. Fifty-six days is just too much. *Too much time away from the scene * Jack thought to himself.

""Well, when I was a young single guy like you Jack, I loved working double-hitches - but I know this way life ain't your thing. Hasn't really ever been.""

Jack nodded, and reached for his bag. A circular personnel basket hanging from the crane's hook was swinging toward Jack. As it settled down in front of him, he set his bag inside and stepped both feet on the outside base while grabbing the roped netting. The rig's crane operator, seeing jack was secure, lifted the basket up and out over the ocean. The empty cargo deck of the boat - which amounted to more than half the vessel - waited one-hundred feet below. Jack peered across the Gulf of Mexico, seeing two more platforms in the distance. 

Why do people do this as a career? he wondered. Twenty, thirty, sometimes forty years?"

So someone called me she In an among us chat and it made me feel happy?,Dalek256,ainbow,( So this is a bit of a followup from a previous post I made here btw )I am a bi Cisgender male however i have recently been questioning wether I am gender fluid and today when I was playing among us someone mistakenly called me she but it made me feel weirdly happy. For context I have a relatively stereotypical feminine skin in among us. I am named ilima after my favourite Pokemon charecter and am usually either the colour red or pink with the headband with a flower on it as my hat so i can see why someone would make that assumption but when they said ilima is good cuz she scanned it made me feel happier I dont realky know why but it just did. On top of that I had a wierd dream the other night where I went to the supermarket to buy something but i was dressed like eleven from stranger things s1 with the pink dress ? I feel like I might be gender fluid cuz I sometimes feel fine being a boy but moments like this have been occurring over the past month. I dont want to jump the gun too fast and say to anyone that Im Gender fluid as I feel I dont know fully yet and tbh Im not sure wether someone calling me a different pronoun in the among us chat or a weird dream are enough evdience for Me.

Feedback on a idea for a play,Rootlessideas,ainbow,"Im writing a screen/stage play about a woman who has fallen in love with her female best friend of 18 years. The friend she has feelings for is pan-sexual and the character is a closeted lesbian who has kept these feelings at bay since her friend had sex with her boyfriend in high school. 

Off a recent breakup she decides to take her friend away to a cabin for the weekend to cheer her up and to celebrate her 30th birthday. But secretly shes hoping to confess her feelings. 

I was if anyone has had similar experiences with confessing feelings for someone and hasnt been sure what the reaction would be? If you could describe what you were thinking as you were planning to telling them... what was your plan if any. What was the conversation like. What was the reaction and did it work out. Few free to give examples of the words spoken.

I want the characters intentions and voice to feel as authentic as possible.

After my first few months of being bisexual my sexuality and my gender have become a messs. At this point I quite literally dont need sleep I need answers,Dalek256,ainbow,"So several months ago i realised I was bi after I had a crush on one of my male friends however now Im starting to doubt everything. It all started when some of my friends found out I had a crush on him and while most of them just where like yh thats cool and kept it as a secret one person decided to tell him. Me still not knowing this, I went to go meet him and our friend group to walk to school the next morning however that was when he rejected me and while Ive handled it relatively well it still annoyed me that someone had told him and I guess i was a bit heartbroken but were still friends and everything has been fine. However in the months between then and now, my attraction to differen genders has been all Over the place It can be so wild and random that one minute Ill feel like I would definetly date a guy and then the next minute Ill feel like I want to just date a girl and Ive felt its been all to random to actually pursue having a romantic interest in someone. On top of all this Ive started to ponder my gender as well. Like my romantic interest these feelings also change wildly and sometimes Ill feel like Im comfortable being a man and other times Ill want to dress more feminine or even sometimes I feel like I just want to Straight up be a girl. I began to wonder Weather I was genderfluid and although theres a genderfluid person in my year who I am freinds with I havent worked up the courage to Talk to them about it and ask them weather this is similar to what they went through. All this is keeping me up at night and I really dont know anymore any advice or explantation to what I am feeling would would help me so much right now"

Concerned about Transwoman friend.,doomflower,ainbow,"Very concerned about my MtF friend. She's definitely not the only friend I have who has transitioned, but she is in a fragile emotional state I've never seen her in before, where others' opinions of her appearance can make or break her entire day. 

She is right at the beginning of her journey, and gets misgendered. A lot. And she takes it 110% personally, i.e., ""Those vicious bastards at the hospital aggressively misgendered me!""  I know she's making an effort to be feminine, but she doesn't feel like anyone could be genuinely getting it wrong because they honestly don't know her life story. 

I'm not trans, I'm an ally. She's been my friend for years, and I hate seeing her struggle so much. But if I say anything on her social media about the misgendering not always being meant as malicious, I'm labeled as a concern troll and that I have no clue about what she's going through, so I should just keep my mouth shut. But I WANT to know what she's going through so I can help her deal with the hurt! I don't like seeing her in a terrible mood all the time, even if it's part of the journey.

How can I help her? Or is it helping her by staying silent and letting her deal with misgendering by raging about it, over and over?"

Then I discovered a Christian site that uses this ""man and woman complete each other and fit perfectly together like a key in a lock"" claim and says that ""everything that can connect to another piece has a man/woman designation"". It says ""Airline botches pro-gay ad, proves marriage is only between man and woman. If the seat belts, aka safety belts consist of either two male or two female ends, they dont actually form a belt because they cant connect. They remain simply two rainbow-colored straps, rendering the term belt a misnomer. As such, the first two pairings do not qualify to be identified as either belts or as devices of safety. Because they are non-complementary, neither term applies.

Hello,daladier9,ainbow, 
The game of Life,Alldone19,ainbow,"I was raised in a very religious home, and while my mother had great love for all people, there was still an understanding that certain ""behaviors"" and ""lifestyles"" were unacceptable.  While cis het myself, I have so many friends from high school onward whose sexuality and identification were considered ""unfortunate,"" and who were severely damaged by the ""love the sinner, hate the sin,"" ""it's a choice,"" ""just don't act on those feelings,"" and other attitudes that we were raised with.

For my kids, I want to make all different sexualities, genders, lifestyles, etc. normal.

So--when we play the game of ""Life,"" I change it up.  I play as pink and marry pink, or blue and marry blue, as often as anything else.  Sometimes my kids do, too."

"Should I run out on my abusive, right wing household? (CW: Physical abuse, slurs, gaslighting/emotional abuse)",DaveGr0hl,ainbow,"Okay, so, for context: I'm 20/M and Gay, and currently live at home and am attending a JC. My parents have never been the *best*, and for every year I've been alive and able to form memories I can list at least 1 traumatic thing they've done that I still remember to this day, but around the time I entered High School, things started getting really bad. For the sake of helping anyone reading this understand as well as being expedient, I will list a smorgasbord of shitty stuff that has happened to me within the past few years of living here.

~ Have had my dad physically assault me not one, but *two* times in the past 3 years - both involved me asking him to please be a little quiet (he'll often blast war movies downstairs at obscene volumes or talk loudly while I'm trying to do schoolwork). Worth noting that the first time this happened was on Christmas Eve.

~ Have had my sister call me a ""gay fat ugly faggot"" (sic) for not opening the front door after she loudly banged on it and did not announce who she was, leading me to believe a serial killer was trying to break in or something. When I asked my dad to do something about it, he said that ""you called her mean names as well (a perfectly reasonable response to being called 2 slurs in 1 sentence, I'd say) so if I punish her I have to punish you too""

~ Had my dad threaten to stop paying for my therapist appointments because, in his own words, ""she makes you hate me.""

~ Had my dad threaten to kick me out immediately after the second time he physically assaulted me, which led to me being suicidal. Then refused to apologize and said ""that's a nice story"" in the subsequent therapist's appointment the day after which led to an anxiety attack that led to me receiving inpatient medical care.

Now, I've been pondering moving out in light of all this (and much more) for a while now, but I think the straw that broke the camel's back, oddly enough, was telling my parents about the ACB nomination and her history on Queer rights, namely Lawrence and her ADF speeches. My mom was pretty steadfast in saying that she wouldn't vote for Trump, wheras my dad said that ""well, you know, I'm thinking of voting for Trump because he's pro business and he won't force people to wear masks.""

And, I don't know - as I'm typing this out, it seems stupid that of all the shitty things that have happened to me while living here, *this* was the straw that finally cracked the Camel's back, but like, I don't know. Something about being told that tax cuts and not having to wear a piece of cloth over your face is more important than doing what you can to make sure throwing your son in jail based on whom he loves has really shown me where his priorities lie. It's especially pissed me off given how many times I've heard that I don't ""care about this family"" when I've reported the years of abuse to school psychs, doctors, friends, etc etc etc.

So, I guess the question lying in this spiel is this: I have some friends who live in another state (albiet a quite red one) who have graciously offered to let me stay in their house and pay a pittance rent with money from my job (without divluging specifics, I can do my job from pretty much any location in the US) in exchange for letting me escape the shitshow of my current living situation. Part of me thinks that this is a great idea, and that continuing to reward my father and the rest of my family for their shitty behavior towrads me by continuing to stay here is only bringing it upon myself. Another part of me thinks that I should try to stick it out until August or so, when they've finally agreed to give up the goat and let me go to a 4-year - we've always been quite well off, and money has never been an issue with us, which could help out tremendously when going through school. I know that if the roles were reversed and I were taking care of my parents, they would have no issue pretending to like me in order to have living expenses paid for. But on the flip side, with the level of constant abuse I've received from them, physical, mental, and emotional, I'm honestly not sure that's worth it at this point.

Thus, I've come to /r/ainbow because I've read similar stories on here and I'm genuinely curious what people who have been in similar situations would have to say as to whether it would be worth it and anything I should know if I do go through with this. Pretty much my entire friend group (god bless them) has told me that I should do this, but I'd be curious to see what an inside perspective looks at. Thanks to anyone who replies!"
Hoping to start over here,Thats_OnPeriodt,ainbow,"I didn't realize how heavily moderated r/lgbt was until I made a discussion and when people didn't agree it was immediately downvoted and removed. If you see this and you're from there, please don't come over here and try to start something again. Honestly after responding to tons of comments, I'm over it."

Hello! I'm a screenwriter looking for feedback on LGBTQIA issues.,jpscreenwriter,ainbow,"Hello All,  
I'm currently working on a TV series that centers on**LGBTQIA**issues, and I**'m looking to expand on my own experiences as a gay male**to make sure the characters are**truthful to the struggles**that are represented in the program. I'm turning to our community to make sure I'm able to create a true and accurate show.  
Below I have listed the issues and some details about the characters. If you don't want to post here and want to chat somehow else please let me know. I want to thank anyone for any help you can provide.

1. Character One- Is an Asian- American teen who was adopted &amp; raised by a religious caucasian family. He hides his sexuality due to his family's religious background and a fear of being disowned. He is completely disconnected from his ethnicity but is bullied for it.

The feedback I'm looking for: If you relate or have experienced anything similar that you're willing to share.  
A few questions I propose are:  
How did your upbringing affect how you view your ethnicity? Did it make you want to connect with your biological parents or others of your ethnic background? Did your relationship with religion and your sexuality ever waver or make you a disbeliever?Anything else you wish to add?  


&gt;2. Character Two: is a teen Trans-male character raised in foster care. He has been moved around a lot and doesn't really have anyone. He also doesn't want or expect anyone to care about him now in his late teens.

Feedback/ Questions: does anyone relate or have anything to share that is important to the struggle for Trans people or children of LGBTQIA background raised in foster care?  
\-Note: Are there any other struggles that should be represented?  


&gt;3. Character Three: Is a closeted high school jock who is Mormon. He accepts he will go on his Mission and marry a woman to hide his sexuality from his family and church.

Questions: Is the closeted high school jock cliche, or does it exist?Were you a bully in high school? If so, why? We're you bullied in high school by someone who turned out to come out years later? LOL: Kinda happened to me... If so, how did that make you feel?Mormon and being gay, did you hide your sexuality? if so why

  
(Trigger warnings): Below contain some dark topics, but these do happen in our community. I'm looking to be truthful to this dark matter as it needs to be talked about to bring it to light.  


&gt;4. Character Four- He is an African American male in- Mid-twenties who experienced abuse at the hand of a relative. His family didn't believe the abuse happened, because of his, he has a very disconnected relationship now. He is now a police officer. He is currently engaged to a woman in the show but is having feelings for another male. He denies his attraction.

Questions: Has anyone experienced anything like this? Has your race or profession had any impacts on your sexuality? Anyone a gay police officer, are you accepted, or do you hide it?

  
Homelessness amongst LGBT youth based on my research, ""LGBT young people ages 13 to 25 are 120 percent more likely to become homeless than their straight peers, according to a national study of 26,000 young people released in November by Chapin Hall, a University of Chicago research."" Which also leads to a drastic increase in sexual and substance abuse.  


&gt;5.Character Five: is a caucasian male who was sent to a conversion camp in his adolescent years. After release, he attempted to take his own life. Fearing being sent back, he fled from home and took to the streets doing anything to survive, including prostitution. He soon became addicted to drugs.

I have researched conversion camps, and the show doesn't focus on them, but instead, it the impact they have on people after.*Has anyone ever experienced one that you be willing to share?*  
*Living on the street &amp;/ or any addiction battles? How did you accept help? Did you want help? Was there a community on the street? Any other suggestions that need or should be represented in this struggle?*  
I want my character to shine a bright light on his issue. Any feedback anyone can give if they ever experienced or know someone who has will help.

  
DISCLAIMER: No one's story will be shared or used. This is only for my education and to get me in the headspace of each character.

  
I want to write these characters to represent the struggles in our community.  
If you have any questions for me, please feel free to ask. I thank anyone for reading and participating."

Battleaxe Bi movement is giving me anxiety and suicidal thoughts,YumiMooon,ainbow," So I have anxiety disorder, cronic depresion and paranoia. I'm 14 yo and it took me like 4 years to finally find out who I am, I was fine until a month ago when I discovered this whole battleaxe bi moviment and I'm getting really uneasy!

About 4 or 3 years ago I tought I was bi, which was already hard for me to process. But at some point I realised it wasn't who I am and I searched up more, then in the end of 2018 I came out to my friends as pan which made me so happy! In the start of this year I realised I'm between omni and pan so I just say I'm both but last month everything changed.

I was always pretty comfy with my sexuality and pretty open-minded. But not to much ago I found out about battleaxe bi, and I kinda understand their feeling??? I was like them at some point but with xenogenders. The thing is I changed, but now that this is happening to me I feel so unvalid and unworthy! I just came out to all my friends as omni/pan and that's something really hard to hear/read right when you finally accepted yourself.

I also just came out as AFAB nb bigender and I'm already with anxiety attacks because of this and my family. I can't stop crying and I can't help but feel like an attention seeker, invalid, a special snowflake, etc. I just wanted to be happy and fine with myself! I used to s3lfh4rm because of my identity and now I'm almost going back to this old habbit... I just wish we could all live in peace.

I'm sorry for the long text but I needed to let it out. I hope you have a nice day.

I feel like I can't handle my boyfriends depression anymore,Dinklelbrot,ainbow,"*T.W.; depression, attempted suicide, self-harm*

Me and my boyfriend have been together for about half a year now. He's my first boyfriend. In the beginning it was pure bliss - we not only share the same hobbies and humor but also support each other. We both have depression, although his is currently way worse than mine. He is in therapy - but sees his therapist only once every two weeks.

But after a couple of months he entered a deeply depressive Phase. It is very difficult and he, in total, stayed with us (me and my family) for almost two months. I was there for him when he had panic attacks. I tried to cheer him up when he was depressed (especially after he almost attempted suicide). I told him how kind of a person he is whenever he blamed himself for his depression. 

But as soon as he is back home he wants to talk over Discord. And the less time I spend talking to him the worse it gets. Sometimes he insists that he's a ""terrible human"" and that he ""should just have jumped that night"". 90% of our conversations are about what's supposedly wrong with him. And everything can trigger a breakdown - which can result in self-harm. It sometimes almost seems like he's proud of his wounds. He even sent me pictures once.
I can't even listen to blues or play guitar because me playing guitar makes him feel like he's untalented (even though he's probably a better musician than I am). Most things I do better than him make him feel inferior and become trigger-topics that shouldn't be talked about.
He has fears that I might one day leave him or that everybody is lying to him and he can't trust anyone except me and his best friend.

I was so stressed out that, shortly after he went back home, I had the worst headaches one could imagine and had to vomit.
I, myself, just barely recovered from a major depression because of which I had to drop out of school. All of this is too much for me. I constantly find myself longing for contact with other people (I have only very few friends left since dropping out and fighting my depression). I regularly have dreams where I have a different boyfriend with whom I do all the cool things me and my boyfriend used to do. Sometimes my sense of reality drifts away and I feel numb and emotionless. Other times I'm nervous and can't focus my thoughts. I have developed ticks and force myself to do things in a certain routine. I fear slipping away into the next depression. 
It feels like I have to take a huge responsibility and the weight is crushing me. My body and psyche are at their limit.

I would never want to loose him. He's such a loving, caring, interesting guy. On the better days we just fit perfectly together. We can sit together on my bed just talking and laughing forever. His smile just fills me with joy as if we just fell in love. He was one of the reasons I was able to overcome my own depression.

But I'm at the brink of what I can endure - and I feel lost and alone. The worst; I can't even tell him how I'm feeling since this would just validate his self-hate and fears. I know that he needs more and, most importantly, professional help but there is no way to provide this in the next six months.

**He once told me that I saved his life by supporting and showing him how much I love him - but I fear that that means that I would risk his life if I stopped doing that.**"

I really like him and the situation is good and I think the conditions might be right to make a move. I think he might have been hinting at him finding me attractive or wanting a relationship. Before he came out to me, he would tell me that he thought that I had a really nice jawline and just little comments like that. Also, after I came out to him he asked me if there was anyone I liked at school and asked me why I came out to him. Am I overthinking it or do you think these might actually be legitimate hints?

The online lgbt community is just another homophobic shithole!,Additionalpainone,ainbow,"Especially with the whole ""sexuality is fluid idea"". I really tried to become straight or at least bi but I can't, all the shit you are saying that ""sexuality is fluid and changes"" is just a ton of homophobic bullshit that made me feel more miserable making me think that sexuality is a choice and that I can become straight! You are literally the same as the homophobic conservatives I have to deal with daily, actually even worse, at least they dont pretend they care about gay people! 

&amp;#x200B;

And your stupid excuse that ""the idea is actually that it can change for some"" means that it CAN change!  It either can change or it cant, saying that for some it works just reinforces conversion therapy by basically saying ""maybe it will work for you too""! You pretend you care, but all you care about is youe stupid agenda, even if you became homophobic! You honestly all disgust me, the lgbt community itself makes me wanna suicide!"

Feeling uncomfortable being treated like a girl (enby 18),Genitalless-Nympho,ainbow,"Lately I've been feeling like people don't really treat me like I'm neither gender. I live in a very progressive city and have all my life, but even though everyone uses my pronouns and everything they still treat me like a girl. 

People still talk to me like they would a girl and treat me like a girl. No matter how supportive they are they all treat me like a girl, especially female friends talking to me like I'm another girl. Its especially uncomfortable when people ask to do feminine things with me when I don't really want to. 

And every girl I've slept with has really treated me like a girl in bed and has expected me to like being treated like a girl, even when I've specifically stated that stuff like touching genitals is off the table. 

I plan to have my breasts and genitals removed and have my body sex horman free. Hopefully that will help."

The Flaws Of Attraction,Snoo_89466,ainbow,"I'm beginning to realize that as humans we aren't really attracted to male or female per se and genitalia is auxiliary or secondary to the confines, protocols, and parameters that we may be inclined to when it comes to sexual attraction. I think that we are more so attracted to femininity and / or masculinity; not simply 'penis or vagina'. I'd like to think that the human evolution and development has allowed us more sophistication than that and we are not the baboons in the Savannah just hunting for a bright blue ass. I don't really have a label for myself but I love all things feminine. CIS females and trans. I ALSO LIKE TO CROSSDRESS and the sight of my own ass in pantyhose has been known to turn me on  as though it weren't even mine and I was looking at someone else.[pause for ensued hilarity] Also sometimes I like to show said ass on some cam sites just for the exhibition of it but I have noticed a plethora of women that are very attracted to men cross-dressed in pantyhose,panties,heels so on and so forth. it is becoming more commonplace than not. I love it. I feel the freedom that people are beginning to enjoy
I would love to hear the thoughts of others and their experiences, questions, comments so on and so forth"

It's like you may say ""oh if im straight/cis i dont say it to everyone"" THAT IS BECAUSE ITS THE DEFAULT and like if you're cis, you dont have to worry about dysphoria making you feel like shit all the time. When I tried to come out as trans to her the entire time she just went on about how im too young or how im just confused because i have trans friends. Then she goes on to say that shes Ok WiTh Me BeInG tRaNs BuT iTs ToO eArLy ToO kNoW and then and FUCKING then she says that im in the middle??? like literally being like ok your trans lets just settle with you being cis but slightly androgynous???? sorry if this post isn't the best im just fed up with my moms bullshit"

"[advice] I've decided to distance myself from my religious homophobic friend, it hurts but it's probably worth it?",Throw1357908642away,ainbow,"I've posted about my friend in the past and hes only gotten worse. This friend has always been homophobic around me and after I came out to him he started calling me a faggot and would get upset if I talked about anything gay in front of him. He's a younger friend (18)...and his church has brainwashed him into thinking gays go to hell for their sin, he hates pride month, he doesn't like straight porn because there's dicks in it, etc. He is very strict on his religious views and despite how young he is he thinks he has to start a family and get married ASAP. 

So the reason this friend threw me off at first was because despite his homophobia, he is so flirty around me. He is very touchy with me, tells me I'm cute and hot and jokes about sex and marriage with me. The part that gets me is that I've caught him staring at me a few times and the one time I asked him why he was looking at me he told me I have a cute face. I've caught him checking out shirtless guys in public too a couple times. He got his first girlfriend a few months ago and tells me he can't even cum when having sex with her but blames the condom for the reason (who knows maybe he's right). Anyways I've finally realized that this guy is either playing with me or he's got some serious internalized homophobia going on but it's probably best that I step away from him. Why should I feel the need to be around someone that talks me down like that when we're supposed to be friends. And why tolerate someone who would act so gay around me and then attack gays. He isn't as flirty with me since I came out to him but I haven't been around him as much anyways due to COVID. He also told me one time before I came out to him that it's weird that I let my other gay friends hug me because he would assume they are attracted to him, this guy is so paranoid about anything gay...

In my previous posts you thought he was struggling with his own sexuality and to be careful with him so I gave him another chance but he's too big of a mess at this point, I finally decided to distance myself. Of course he's offended by it...."

Need advice. I still have romantic feelings for my best friend,_san_garcia_,ainbow,"So I have been best friends with this guy for about 7 years. We used to do everything together, we would literally hangout everyday when we were in High school. And back then I hadnt explored my sexuality. I honestly thought I was straight (now knowing Im a bi sexual man.) I remember the summer after we graduated high school we continued to hang out, but I had been going through a rough patch with my family and was drinking alcohol a lot to not face my feelings about my life. So to make me feel better me and my friend would go out and drink sometimes. 

On this particular weekend we met up that night and just hung out in my car drinking, laughing, and having a good time. When all of a sudden we started talking about things that were going on in our life that were affecting us. Thats when we started hooking up out of nowhere, which he initiated. After the whole experience was over he didnt seem to remember any of it, but I did. I remembered all the details everything we did sexually it was really painful to be the only one to remember all of it. 

After that we didnt talk for a few months and I went into therapy to try to cope with what I was feeling. I started gaining romantic feelings for my friends not knowing if it was because I actually felt romantic feelings toward him or because he was the first guy I had ever slept with. And we didnt talk for about everything that happened to probably another year or so later. We are both now in our early twenties, and since then we re-grew our relationship and are closer than ever. I used that experience as a jumping off point to finding out who I am and my sexuality. And now I am comfortable to say that I have an amazing boyfriend and we are very happy and have been dating for years. As well as my friend finding a beautiful girlfriend that he loves and they are really happy together. I can also tell that my friend is not the same person he was. Hes more open about his feelings and has told me a few times that he is still exploring his sexuality even though hes with his girlfriend. Hes not cheating on her hes just trying to figure out where his sexuality lies. 

We have even talked about what happened between us that night in detail and move on. But recently when we were hanging out he brought up the experience we had again randomly. I found it extremely hard for me to talk about it because I worked so hard on healing my emotions and moving on. I didnt really want to talk about what happened because I dont think it was relevant to whats going on between us today and where we are in our lives. I used to be madly in love with him and I had to bury that part of me move on because it just wasnt gonna work with how he felt in the past and I needed to move on. But he said recently that he wanted to talk about it because he wanted closure in the situation. So he wanted a detailed timeline of what happened that night. Which confused me because we had talked about the experience before in detail a couple years ago. So I agreed and I told him what I could remember. He said thank you and he didnt make it a big deal but he said he was happy that we never let that experience make things weird or get between our friendship. And how weve grown to be so much stronger. 

But the conversation recently took me back to a very dark place of wishing that things worked out between us romantically but also making me very confused because I really am in love with my current boyfriend but I might also be in love with my best friend. Im just struggling so hard right now and trying to know whats real and what isnt. I dont understand why he would bring this situation up for years later when we are both doing great with our significant others. One of my friends that I talked to about this recently thinks that he might be trying to relive the only gay sexual experience that hes ever had in his life to help suppress how he really feels about his sexuality. I dont know what to do. I dont want to tell him how I really feel about him because I dont wanna lose him because I truly do love him as a person. I want him in my life. But I also know that I cant keep suppressing the fact that I might still be in love with him all these years. I could really use advice about the whole situation.

Need advice thank you"

-----------

So, I want to start off saying that a lot of my opinions here... they're just based on personal experience, or more notably, lack of it. I'm not making any objective claims about any specific types of people. 

The reason I'm here is that everyone around me seems to be totally on board with gender fluidity, and, I'm skeptical, so I'm concerned my personal experiences have biased me towards what may be the wrong position. I guess... I'm sort of hoping to be corrected in part, which is why I'm posting here... but I still feel skepticism. My hope is that I'll share my limited experiences, and then hopefully some people can relate and explain why these experiences... should not make me feel skeptical? Maybe? I don't know I guess I'm a little confused, but here it goes.

---------

Also all personal details were changed. 
---------

I understand and agree with all lesbian, gay and bi rights. No issues whatsoever, I feel like I understand that experience.

With transgender stuff, I'm not familiar with anything, but like, it doesn't bother me or anything, live your life I guess. I have no issue calling someone he or she regardless of how they were born. I've only gotten to know a few trans people, and... I guess maybe they weren't the most confident people in the world, but I don't think they were trying to deceive anyone or gain anything specific from being trans. Kinda, live and let live for me there I guess. 

But when it comes to non-binary people... 

I know I can never know the experiences of another person. I can't read another person's mind and know their life experience. 

I've met exactly 4 people who told me they were non-binary in my life. All of them were women who had the habit of doing attention seeking things and playing victim in different scenarios. 

Experience 1 

One experience was a tad uncomfortable for me, where I was with a bunch of friends for a friend's birthday at a pub. This woman - ??? idk the right term --- says she's non-binary and wants me to call her ""R"". Ok fine, that's not a lot of effort on my part. TLDR she makes the entire night about her and turns all conversations to sex when she's not getting enough attention from people. A few weeks later I find out from one of the friends that she left our group chat after 300 messages in 2 hours because she had been misgendered several times where people said ""she"" or ""her"" and she wanted to be called ""them"" all the time. I think that's a little much. One of my earlier sentences would look so dumb without a specific he/she pronoun. EG:

""TLDR them makes the entire night about them and turns all conversations to sex when they are not getting enough attention from people.""

Like Jesus really? I understand it's a preference and I don't mind accommodating he/she in the slightest, but myself and I'm sure a lot of other people just trip over having to use ""them/they"" because in English is refers specifically to plural. I'll make an effort when I can, but if I have to worry that my conditioning for the grammatical singular is going to trigger someone enough to cause drama on chats, I don't really want to be apart of any conversation like that - I'd straight up rather leave R out of anything I have to say than me dragged through the mud over something that I see as rather benign and non-malicious.

Experience 2 

Again involving group chats - we have a badminton group. It's mostly couples. The chat is almost 100% silent except to coordinate get togethers and to pass along various equipment. This girl Samantha, after 2 months of the chat being completely quiet since we weren't getting together for covid - announces that she's leaving because her and her boyfriend broke up. ""Thanks it's been fun, but it would just be so awkward now to come."" This group chat has existed for 3 years and she's only come to play with us twice ever, she wasn't full involved in our stuff and there was no need to announce that she was leaving... no one would have noticed, it was to draw attention to herself. I bit anyway - I thought, ok maybe she just needs to talk to someone. So we meet for dinner after I reach out and she tells me that she's non-binary and her boyfriend is the worst for not accepting that. She asked him to call her Sam instead of Samantha and according to her he refused. After a few months, he broke up with her because she insisted on being called Samantha. She pressed the issue because she felt firmly that she didn't identify as a woman, and he broke up with her. But if I think of it from his perspective - if he genuinely believes his girlfriend saying that she feels like she's not a woman and wants to be purely gender neutral, is he wrong for taking her at her word and not wanting to be in a relationship with someone who isn't a woman? Her perspective on the matter was that he should love her regardless of what gender she is and the fact that he couldn't was essentially bigoted based on her Facebook posts about the break up. She proceeds to tell me that hopped on Tinder and she's loving getting a bunch of messages from men who call her beautiful, etc. She showed me her profile and she's presenting herself as a woman. I mean... I feel like you sort of have to choose, don't you? I felt like she was flip flopping what she was (woman/non-binary) based on what got her more attention at the time. I spoke to him about it later since we've been friends for years, and he basically said she'd act all pissed and not answer his texts for a day if he used she/her/Samantha, even in front of people who she hadn't revealed she was non-binary to. While part of the issue was the fact that she didn't identify as a woman, he was tired of being ignored, which makes sense to me.

Experience 3

Diva family members (twins) are your stereotypical SJW, cancel culture twitter trolls. They appear super supportive of various movements but it's like they wait for any opportunity for people to slip up and then go for the jugular. A lot of what's on their twitter I actually agree with (anti trump, pro choice, LGBT rights). But then they go further and are kinda hard core feminist-ish and they go into areas that feel more like blaming people rather than looking for solutions. Whenever something bad happens, it's the end of the world and they hate someone. So much of this has to do with how they were raised. Their mom is a total push over and gives them anything they want. I cannot emphasize how spoiled they are and how much they always get their way. They're 23, don't work, one went to school part time and dropped out. They're really big on calling people out on gender based assumptions and have so many posts about this on their instagram. 

These experiences have this in common:

- They claim they're non-binary

- They use non-binary as an identity when it suits them, but they're women when it's convenient for them.

- They engage in attention seeking behavior, especially on social media or online

- They use their non-binary status to play the victim in various scenarios - using wrong pronouns, gender based assumptions. Honestly, nothing actually hateful was done to these people, but their reactions are so full of self pity.

These are my only experiences with self-proclaimed non-binary people. To me, it doesn't feel genuine. It feels like everyone I've met who is non-binary is doing it to further their personal agenda of getting more attention or being a victim. Remember when ""cutting""/being emo was kind of ""popular"" 10-15 years ago, with kids being edgy about self harm? It feels like the modern version of that. With gay or bi friends I have, it's not about that at all - sometimes people were nervous to come out, but they don't spam it all over the place. They just live their lives for the most part - they don't claim to be gay or bi to benefit them, they're just correctly identifying what and who they're attracted to. It's not for likes on social media or to garner sympathy. 

So... I guess I'm skeptical of non-binary being real. It feels more like a trend people do, and it seems to mostly be women who are attention seeking. I know I can't KNOW how they feel, but the track record is kinda... idk I just don't really believe in non-binary tbh.

That, plus the genuine fear of being labeled a bigot over using he/she instead of ""them"" in sentences where the singular is correct - like Jesus I don't want to be paranoid over grammar, it will genuinely scare me away from having a conversation with people who identify like this, or talking about them at all."

Random thoughts in a gay bar,jsundqui,ainbow,"So I went to a gay bar again because, well, I am lonely sometimes. 

There was a handsome guy sitting close to me and fair enough soon a predator type of guy came to him and told him the cheesiest and phony compliments I have ever heard. And that guy bought it! Soon after I saw them kissing on dance floor.

Then I saw another boy and some older guy was all around him and persuading him to go to his place. And it worked too!

Me on the other hand, who would like to get a real, genuine connection without cheesy compliments or persuasion will always end up alone. It feels like the wrong kind of people always win. When will it be my turn to prevail?"

Very confused,turuturu94,ainbow,"I am a 25 year old man, I live in Spain, and I am really confused about my sexuality.

First of all, I do not want to offend anyone with this post, I only want to express myself, sorry in advance if someone feels offended.

I like girls, I like all their physique, I am attracted to them, their behavior etc ... but for some reason I do not feel excited with them, I do not like female genitalia, I simply cannot feel excited.

On the other hand, I feel a very strong excitement towards the male genitalia, but the man's physique does not attract me at all, sexually I do not like masculinity.

Because of this, I am very sexually attracted to transgender women and crossdressers. I do not see it as a fetish, but as a sexual orientation, since I cannot feel that sexual arousal in any other way, I cannot feel it with a cis woman, nor with a masculine man, only with CDs and transgender women.

At most, I can feel some attraction towards an extremely feminine boy physically, to the point that he seems androgynous.

I know it's weird, but I really get frustrated sexually by this, plus a lot of people get offended when I talk about it."
Tell Me Why - Game Made to Diffuse the tolerance toward Transgender community,HTFGamesStudio,ainbow,"Tell me why is an adventure game developed by ""Dontnod Entertainment"" and published in 2020. One of the main protagonists is Oley a girl that wanted to be a boy since young. Unfortunate circumstances lead to threatening the child by the mother with a shotgun. To protect her sister killed the mother. The story is built around these unfortunate circumstances. Several years later the two children become adults and Oley changed the name to Taylor after finished the pill treatment. Now that they are reunited again they want to learn more about what really happened the day their mother died.

This game was made to influence public opinion to be tolerant toward people that see the world differently to prevent unfortunate consequences like happened in this game. I suggest you check out the game. But if you didn't want to buy and play it you can still watch some gameplays I realized to share the story of this interesting adventure game. Despite I'm not a trans I support the idea that people have to be tolerant toward this community.

My mom wont let me have tiktok so I was going through tiktok on my cousins phone. I found my best friends account and the bio said

he/him
boy 

Ive only ever known this friend as a girl, as thats (his?) birth sex. 

Im going to use he/him since thats what the tiktok bio said. 

I scrolled through the videos on his account and one of them was him coming out as trans. I got really upset because he didnt tell me! He knows Im acceptingIm lesbian myself and have always been super supportive of everything lgbt+!

Weve got some zoom lessons together and I heard the math teacher call my friend a different nameI just assumed hed logged in on someone elses phone. Turns out thats his new name. 

Im just feeling so hurt. He can put it in his tiktok bio but he cant tell me? Weve been best friends since we were five and have always been so, so open with one another. I know its important to come out on your own time but Im feeling pretty upset. Im probably just being an asshole though. 

I messaged him on snapchat and said Hey, I saw he/him in your tiktok bioshould I start using that now? and he ignored the message. 

What should I do? Should I message him again? I dont want to misgender him/make him uncomfortable by using the wrong name/pronouns."

Can someone tell me if they have also felt this? Am I being dumb? It's just been so weird cause I am pretty sure I'm straight and I don't ever feel like doing anything sexual on the reg with anyone but for some reason, after meeting these two girls (like weeks after knowing them) all of a sudden I feel like...well y'know.

Sure, some homosexual individuals might act/dress a like the other gender sometimes, but many also act a lot like their gender. Your wouldn't start being attracted to someone just because you dress a certain way, so stop assuming everyone else will. You can be attracted to any gender(s), identify as any gender, and dress or present in any way you'd like."

Tell them their vocalness of their religious beliefs and actions are pushing me further away. Praying that I make the right choices to please god isnt going to change me. Its only going to piss me off... 

Theres something I never told anyone else about when they found out I have been hiding my boyfriend because I was scared to because I was afraid theyd freak out or not believe me.

When they found out I had a boyfriend they initially freaked out and were extremely cold to me for several days telling me they needed to process things.
few days later they asked if I had had sex with my boyfriend. I was scared, I tried to refuse to respond but they kept yelling at me and demanding to know. they have rarely ever yelled at me or physically harmed me on purpose but honestly at that moment I thought they were going to do one of the things Ive heard of happening to preacher kids in the lgbt.
I broke under their pressure and I told them I love him and they cant change that while I was sobbing. 
I was stuck in a loop of sobbing and almost chanting please dont hurt me, please dont send me away to one of those indoctrination camps idk when i stopped. All I know is they left me alone for a long time afterwards I felt chained to the chair I was sitting in. 
I remember they left me alone after they stood there watching me sob for a few minutes after They asked me why I thought they were going to hurt me or send me away. I didnt respond to their question. I was stuck in that loop. 

Since then theyve told me they cant trust me and that Im a liar and a bunch of other stuff. Ive not actually eaten a hot dinner since June when they found out... I honestly dont care I like eating alone in the quiet or while chatting with my friends in discord.

I keep telling myself that six months to a year from now I can move out to that nice appartment complex one of my best friends and her girlfriend live at. I just have to keep saving and my sanity for that long."

Advice on compliments,2Spoopy5,ainbow,"So my spouse is an amab gender fluid person.  They have been moving in a more feminine direction over the last few years, and I am starting to suspect that the gender fluid identification is not where their gender journey will end, and they may be working up to coming out as a woman.  I don't want to make assumptions, but I also want to treat them in a way that makes them feel more comfortable about it if my suspicion is correct.  I was the that maybe feminizing the compliments I give them might be a good start.  If they stay with the gender fluid identity, then those kinds of compliments would still make them feel less like they are being gendered as a man, but also could help them feel seen if they end up transitioning to women.  So my question is to AMAB women and non-bianary folks:  what kinds of compliments give you a sense of gender euphoria?"

Catholic Mom is praying for me to change,lillezzie,ainbow,"I came out a year and a half ago as a lesbian, and had a girlfriend at the time. Recently we broke up, and I knew this information would give my extremely religious catholic mother hope that I would change back. 
She subtly hints that I can be an aunt and not have kids and be perfectly happy. Also recently I found a text that she sent to her bible group to pray for me so God can help guide me back to the light and change my ways. I also found a meme she screenshotted that insinuates that gay love is equal to pedophelia. 
Besides her subtly telling me she doesnt agree with me having kids with a woman, she has been welcoming to my ex girlfriend and doesnt say homophobic stuff to my face. But knowing she feels like I can and should change and become straight, I feel so uncomfortable around her and I feel so hurt. 
I live with my parents because Im in grad school and cant afford to live anywhere else at least until the summer. What information can I give to my extremely catholic mother so that she might one day accept me? What can I say to her?"

Non binary-what sexuality are they?,Meulinia,ainbow,"Hi, how does a non binary person sexually identify? If a person is afab and heterosexual but becomes non binary are they still heterosexual? Since heterosexuality focuses on 2 genders but the non binary person is non of those genders (a gender) then do they become Pansexual/bisexual since the non binary person themselves would fall into the pan sexual category? Im really confused...


So cab that non-binary heterosexual person only be with another Pansexual/bisexual male? 

I guess Im asking if a non binary person can be with a person thats heterosexual since non binary isnt neither male or female. 
Lets also say that the non binary person also looks very androgynous so a heterosexual guy would probably not be into a person that looks so androgynous (not feminine enough, something in between)"

Confused and desperate for advice please,paigeunknown,ainbow,"Im an 18 year old girl and recently Ive come to the conclusion that I purely like women. But I have this male friend that Ive had for around two years he was in love with me and liked me for a long time, I didnt have the same feeling for him. Now our friendship is platonic. Its mean to say this but I dont really care to be friends with him its seems very forced and I feel guilty. Recently we hung out he got drunk and brung old feelings up and ever since Ive felt very weird about it. Ive crushed on women for the past few years. I have no desire to be with him but Im getting a lot of anxiety thinking about feeling towards him and sick, I sort of just want to cut our friendship. I cringe when I think about anything romantic with him, he makes sexual jokes about my family members including my mum, and sister and I dont like it, I dont like the way he talks about women. Please someone give me advice on what to do I literally cant sleep"

I thought I was aroace but now I'm confused :/,BitchImAKing,ainbow,"
So I am a demiboy and I used to identify as an aromantic asexual but I'm not so sure anymore because I find myself feeling sexual and romantic attraction from time to time. And that would make me gray asexual and gray aromantic, right? But I'm not sure that those labels fit me.

The few times where I feel sexual attraction it's for boys and when I feel romantic attraction it's for both girls and boys. I'm currently identifying as noviromantic and novisexual but idk I'd like a more precise term and I'm thinking of calling myself an androphile."

Coming out to best friend,Hyphen1-2,ainbow,"Guys I really really want to be out already. I feel like I can do it now I just dont know whats stopping me tho. Every time I get close to doing it I get scared. I dont know if Im scared of what my parents reaction be or if its just because Im genuinely scared. I feel like my parents arent really too sure what being me being gay means. For example, I was watching a video with a kid doing flamboyant gestures and my mom asked if I was watching a gay video, nothing that big of a deal. I know that the kid wasnt gay but maybe thats just her knowledge or perception of gay people. I really dont think she knows much about the lgbt community. I feel like my dad is pretty informed I just dont know if he would accept me. I mean as a family we watch shows with lgbt characters and they dont say nothing or make weird faces. However, if its like a gay couple kissing for a while they skip 10 seconds forward without saying anything. Its just kind of weird and i dont know how theyll react. I feel like they wouldnt kick me out or not love me. I just feel like at the most they would need time to understand which Im willing to give. Thats what I think is stopping me from coming out.

I for sure know Im gay though. Ive struggled with accepting it, but I know I am. I am sexually attracted to men and not women. I want to come out to my best friend but something is stopping me. Maybe im just scared of finally being out to someone. But I know when I do come out it will be so relieving. I know she will 100% accept me but Im just scared and dont know why. If anyone had any advice or tips, please let me know"

"Bisexual women/lesbians, how do you feel about being a bicurious person's ""first""?",ProblemMachine89,ainbow,"(Apologies for any awkward English. Non-native speaker and it's 3am.) 

I recently posted in r/bisexual about missing my chance to really explore my sexuality since I am married. While my very supportive husband is fine with me being with a woman, I definitely do not want to make anyone feel like I am fetishizing them or only using them to fulfill a fantasy of mine. It adds to my anxiety enough that I do not want to pursue that any longer and just live with regrets.

Someone commented that the gay men he knew actually find it hot to be a bicurious person's first experience, to be the first to teach them and explore with them. Although I know that everyone is different, is it sort of the same for women loving women? If not, how would you feel about it exactly? I really want to be educated about this so if you have any advise, I'd greatly appreciate it."

I need advice... I desperately want to be happy for lgbtqia+ people who have it easier than me but I'm so bitter. CW,FreyaIsBae,ainbow,"My parents tried to beat the trans out of me when I was six through eight, classmates bullied me ruthlessly, grandparents put me through conversion therapy, and the whole family made me homeless when I finally came out for good this year(and thee are just some of the issues I've faced for simply being queers on top of so many other kinds of abuse for other reasons)and... it hurts so much. I hear about other queer people who have families that love them and it just feels like gloating. I see out trans kids and I get so angry about how much time I've lost. I know financially privileged gsrm people and I keep thinking about how I was a president's list Accounting student working and caring for a child and it got ripped from me and I'm left with nothing but a cracked phone and I'm sleeping in a shed.
I don't want people to suffer and I want to make a better world for queer people but I don't know how to not project that hurt into jealousy. I never make it anyone else's problem but it never leaves my mind. I try to be empathetic and supportive and celebrate that they didn't go through what I have and currently am. However, I always find myself secretly hating them and feeling trapped and alone. Even one of my best friends I can barely be around because they're an out non binary person and they're entire family supports them, is paying their rent and college tuition, and they even bought them a pretty bougie car. 
This is the only thing I find myself irrationally resenting people for and I want to stop, these people don't deserve it."

Unpopular Opinion: The LGBT community suffers greatly from herd mentality and isolates its own members for having outside opinions.,buyingsecrets,ainbow,"Hello everyone,

I am bisexual but often hesitate to tell people this because I'm afraid they will mistake my sexual orientation for many of the opinions and politics that the LGBT community has. The LGBT community always seems to pride itself on ""individuality"" when it is the exact opposite. If someone has an outside view, they are chastised and ostracized for not fitting the status quo. This can make it very lonely for people who have unpopular opinions or want to discuss controversial topics. 

I think the LGBT community should only have a few things in common. Being a member of this community shouldn't mean we all have a hivemind where we believe in the same things, support the same politics, have the same interests, and adopt the same personality. Of course, there will be overlap in many of those things, but I don't like the pressure to fit into a certain box. There are things I certainly don't agree with that the majority of the LGBT community supports, and I don't want people to assume those things onto me. It's incredibly frustrating."
Someone says that being labeled anti-lgbt is hateful. It would be funny if it weren't so sad.,IcyLanguage,ainbow,"Someone at work is annoyed because he's been labeled as anti-lgbt because he's against same-sex marriage. He says it's a hateful label and people should take into account reasoning behind viewpoints. I engage in conversation, as a gay man interested in marrying and adopting one day. I let him know that his reasons behind being against same sex marriage doesn't really matter because the end result is still the same--discrimination is still happening and you can't cherry pick support. Here's what he says:

""I don't think that the reasons I have for opposing same-sex marriage are moot if the reasons I have are valid. I believe they are. I understand your strong desire to adopt a child and I commend you for that. But one thing that we need to keep in mind is that just because we desire something, it doesn't guarantee that what we desire is good for us or others who are involved. When it comes to adopting children, we have to consider what is best for the child. I'm not saying that same-sex couples are bad parents. I'm not saying that children raised by same-sex couples will turn out bad. What I'm saying is that I believe that it is best if a child is raised by a loving father and mother. The reason I believe that is because I believe males and females are different, and each has unique gifts that benefit children that they raise. Yes, I'm aware of all the studies that say that children raised by same-sex couples turn out just as well as children raised by heterosexual couples, but I think the term just as well is very subjective. What does it actually mean? I don't believe that men and women are interchangeable as parents. I think that there are men and women for a reason. It isn't just an evolutionary fluke. A male/female couple brings both masculine and feminine traits to the parenting table that help their children to develop.""

Honestly, I just left it at that and don't plan to engage anymore. You can't argue with delusional people who can't even realize they're discriminating against an entire group of people."
My coming out story (repost in honor of National Coming Out Day),toesucker17,ainbow,"So I thought I'd just share my personal story of how I realized I was bisexual.

Okay. So every time I try to remember where my bisexuality started, I think I can pinpoint it but then I remember something from even earlier in life. The earliest I can remember is Sept 1991. I was 4 years old. Yeah, I was 4. And I was watching the pilot of Home Improvement, and it came to the scene where Tim &amp; Mark start working on the dishwasher and they take their shirts off. At 4 years old something stirred inside me. I didn't understand what or why, just that I liked that scene. And because my dad had taped it for my mom because she was working night shift, I got that tape (I learned how to work a VCR at 3 years old lol) and watched that scene over and over again. Around the same time I remember undressing my Buddy doll (look it up) and hanging out with him naked in my room. Again not understanding why, just wanting to be naked with the doll. Eventually my parents got annoyed/concerened that I was getting naked so often and spending so much time watching that Home Improvement episode so they took the doll away, deliberately taped over the Home Improvement episode (you know how much a recording of the very first airing of Home Improvement including commercials would be worth now?! lol) and made me stay downstairs with them as much as possible. I was very confused about what I had done wrong.

So my next earliest memory of same-sex attraction was in second grade, it was fall 1995, I'd just turned 8 and I'd seen an episode of Goof Troop where Max &amp; PJ go swimming, and wanting to see that episode again. I remember laying in bed at night, imagining an episode where Max &amp; PJ went skinny dipping. the following summer the film adaptation of Flipper came out and even though I didn't get to see it in theaters, I wanted to. There was a cover story in Disney Adventures that along with interviews and behind-the-scenes looks, had a few pics of Elijah Wood shirtless. I looked at that issue quite frequently. My family never got around to seeing it in theatres but I did rent it the first week it came out on video. And enjoyed Elijah Wood's many swimming scenes lol.

I remember the first time I heard the word ""gay"", it was spring 1997, I was 9, and the movie In And Out was being released. I saw the TV spot on my own while watching a Home Improvement rerun (full circle lol) but then every time I saw it with my parents they'd either immediately mute it or change the channel. Didn't understand why but didn't really want to ask. My parents were NEVER big on communication or explaining why things were right or wrong, just that they are and they should never be questioned. The first time I heard gay in a negative context was that fall, 1997, I had just turned 10, and in a very weird twist of fate, it was a Cosby episode (not the original Cosby series, the 90s series with Madelyn Kahn). Hilton unwillingly joins a gay softball team. my dad freaks out, turns the TV off, and immediately starts lecturing my sister and I that being gay is evil and wrong and gay people all deserve to die. Not once did he even mention what being gay meant. I couldn't even tell you where I learned what it actually meant, it probably wasn't until I was in 7th grade, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

In the summer of 1998 a family moved in across the street from us and I befriended the son who was a year ahead of me. i was a big outcast at school so this was my first real experience with a friendship. We'd go swimming and have sleepovers and every time I caught myself unconsciously checking out his body. I couldn't even explain why. Okay so, soon after I turned 12, I started coming up with these elaborate fantasies about skinny dipping with my neighbor friend, and when I say elaborate I mean elaborate lol like I imagined what our day had been like leading up to us skinny dipping, I imagined we were hiking in Harding Park and came across a hidden lake. I also found myself checking out guys in the locker room after gym class. But what's weird is even though I'd become aroused, I never masturbated, I didn't start until about a year later and even then I didn't know what it was yet, just that it felt really really good. Right before I turned 14 I was spending the night at a friend's house and I don't even remember how it started but we ended up getting naked in his bed and masturbating together. We didn't touch each other, but for some reason I kept feeling compelled to rub my bare feet on his bare feet. He didn't seem to care. That happened every time we got the chance, then about a year later, it was summer 2002 and he was spending the night again, we were naked and masturbating in bed when he suddenly rolled over on top of me and started grinding on me. This was new and a little scary but it felt so good! I won't go into the details of what all we did but for the next 2 years we messed around every chance we got. In bed, in the pool changing room, in his dad's garage, the woods. By now we both knew what being gay was and how it was looked down on, (especially considering we went to Catholic school) so we told ourselves we weren't gay (by now I was also becoming very attracted to girls as well) we told ourselves we were just two horny virgins looking for an orgasm. And for a long time I believed it...

So, the messing around with my friend ended after 2 years when I was 16. He got a girlfriend and lost his virginity and didn't need me anymore. He and I never messed around again and eventually drifted apart. In a frustrating twist he's actually become a rabid anti-gay bible thumper. From there my bisexual tendencies kind of faded away for the time being. I became exclusively focused on girls and eventually lost my virginity to a woman at the tender age of 20 lol.

Fast forward to the summer of 2012. I'm now 24 and I start feeling attracted to other guys again. I find myself remembering those times with my friend with fondness. I found myself paying just as much attention to the guys in porn as the women, and even found myself watching gay porn. It would take me almost another year to work up the courage to do anything about it but in summer 2013 at the encouragement of a very good friend I placed an ad on Craigslist (in hindsight pretty risky but I was lucky) I was messaged by a 23 year old guy. After emailing and texting for a few days and becoming reasonably sure he wasn't a serial killer, we met at a McDonald's and then drove to a secluded field by a set of railroad tracks. And it was amazing. Over that summer I met up for sex with him and a few other guys I met online. In September of that year I met a guy that would change my life forever and not in a good way. We met up once and the sex was ok, not great but ok. For some reason he became absolutely obsessed with me, he wanted me to be his boyfriend. But not only was I not ready to openly date a guy, I wasn't that into him even if I was ready. He kept trying for a few weeks but eventually gave up. So fast forward to Feb 2014 and he contacts me apologizing for getting so obsessed and asking if I wanted to come over just for sex and I did. Afterwards we were cuddling naked in his bed and he again asks if I'll be his boyfriend. I again explained my reason for not wanting to take that step. Something inside of him snapped. He jumped on top of me and started choking me, a physical fight I don't remember all the details of ensued, I was kicked and punched and he eventually calmed down and apologized, I quickly got dressed and left. After that I didn't hear from again for another 2 years (more on him in a moment). In April of that year I attended an event on campus my friend had organized, it was a public gathering of an LGBT support group and people could talk about their experiences with coming out, prejudice they faced, anything they wanted to talk about. I got up there and told an abbreviated version of my story. It was the first time I'd really acknowledged that I was bisexual in front of anyone other than a few close personal friends and it was very liberating even though I was shaking the entire time.

Now we fast forward to summer 2016. My stalker returned. He demanded I have sex with him again. And I refused. So he informed me he'd found me on Facebook and would out me to all my friends if I didn't give in to him. So I beat him to the punch and decided to out myself. It was nerve racking but I did not want to have to be with him again and the public response was overwhelmingly positive. So now here I am over a year later and I'm reasonably at peace with myself and my sexuality. Obviously my family still doesn't know and it's gotta stay that way but my friends support me and that's what matters. And also, shortly after I came out, for the first time in my life, I met a guy who I actually had feelings for. All my previous encounters had been physical only but there was something about this guy. I knew things were different the first time we cuddled after sex and I caught myself rubbing my toes up and down his bare feet, something I usually only did with women after sex. Even though things didn't work out it was an educational experience for me to learn I could not just have sex with a guy but also develop genuine feelings for. Who knows where things are gonna go from here?"

Someone reading this may remember I posted on here awhile ago about the trials and tribulations of trying to be an openly gay musician (or openly gay period) in a conservative neighborhood (especially during COVID!). 

I wanted to follow up and just say thanks because the insane amount of support I received on the post was uncharacteristic of my experience up to that point and so, so inspiring. So inspiring, in fact, that I decided to write and release a new song with my high school best friend, about the first guy I ever fell in love with, an old straight best friend : (

I hope this doesn't come off as spammy, but I thought it would be silly not to share and ask for feedback after how glad I was I posted here last time!

Just want to give slime rancher a shout out for being so inclusive.,EisConfused,ainbow,"Slime rancher is the cutest game I've played in a very long time. Its what I've been doing to help with the stress of the year. Its pretty simple and unlike other farming games your pets don't die if you got lost exploring, they just escape, there isn't even any real combat. If you read the flavor text of the game even the bad slimes aren't killed theyre just reabsorbed by the great slime sea and will show back up later. The only casualties are the chickens. 

But thats not what I'm posting it here for. I'm posting it here because the story is so purposefully vague about the main characters partners gender. Their name is Casey, and not once are pronouns used. The only indication of what they look like is the end credits and they could be a girl with a punk hair cut or a dude with lots of piercings. The only thing that gives a concrete clue (the letters Casey send you sound like intense cottage core lesbians but dudes like coffee shops too) is that the end credits song that plays right after Casey mentions singing for you is sung by a Cassandra.

And as the added cherry the main character is poc I think. Again, nothing stated, but still. 

You go slime rancher. You've improved my year via insessently happy slimes and filled me with happy cottage core lesbian thoughts."

Participate in a Research Interview,NatGallResearch,ainbow,"Hello!

Im recruiting participants for a study about peoples understanding of their own gender + sexuality, and their experiences with the ideas others hold about their group. This two-part research study is called Community Interviews (STU00213154), and includes a one-hour long video-recorded research interview with me as well as a brief online follow up survey. This data is being collected for research purposes and your information will be treated as confidential. Participants will be compensated $25 for their time, via a digital gift card of their choice. 

I am recruiting people who identify as transgender or otherwise gender-nonconforming (any identification or experience within the trans\* umbrella) and people whose sexuality is neither heterosexual nor homosexual (for example: bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer, etc). Participants must be between the ages of 18 and 40, living in the US, and able to complete both parts of the study (interview &amp; survey).

This study is designed to directly incorporate the voices + experiences of members of the BTQ+ community into the development of social theory. Im doing this work as a psychology graduate student at Northwestern University, under the supervision of my advisor, Dr. Doug Medin.

If youre interested in participating, email me at [natalieg@u.northwestern.edu](mailto:natalieg@u.northwestern.edu) for more information. Also feel free to email me with questions, concerns, or marginalia!

I never realized how many people in my field and its adjacent fields were homophobic.,AnonHidingFromHubby,ainbow,"I [21M BI] love my new job. Ive never worked harder than I am currently at this job. Its amazing, theyre training me to be proficient at all the different machines in the machine shop... where almost all my coworkers are in their early 30s to mid sixties. Theyve made homophobic jokes out the gate and I havent come out to them -obviously- theyre the stereotypical machine shop people. Immature, talk about their sec lives a lot, everything is a sec joke, ect.

Ive been lying about my boyfriend [19M bi] being a girl just so theyll stop pestering me about my personal life. My boyfriend does a lot of martial arts (MMA, HEMA, And a few others) and goes to the gym all The time, despite his slightly feminine personality traits. 

Theyre been wanting to see a picture of my girlfriend and Ive said I dont really keep them around because my parents hate her and occasionally snatch my phone and try to access my stuff so I dont keep much on there picture wise, which isnt a lie. Unfortunately my parents try to get into my phone when I leave it sitting around because they want to figure out whos corrupted their good Christian boy when I dropped the facade of being religious so I wouldnt have to betray myself any longer by going to their cult like activities. (Sorry for the tangent)

I hate lying but honestly I dont want to lose this job nor do I want to get harassed by my coworkers. Especially since Once Im proficient in the shop Ill more or less be in charge of the shop and be the head engineer/foremans right hand man... 
I really dont want my boyfriend to know Im stressed about this because I hate when hes upset because he feels powerless to help me in these problems.

On a side note my boyfriend is still in the closet to both my parents and his parents while Im out of the closet to my parents whom continually try to fix me because my dad is a minister in the church.

Im in the Midwest for context."

Need Some Affirmation Advice,Morgwynis,ainbow,"I've been on HRT for over a year now (MtF), and it's getting to the point that people in public are starting to correctly gender me about 60% of the time.

Being correctly gendered and named has given me somewhat of a wealth of mental happiness and coming home to where I should be most safe only to be dead named/gendered instantly depletes it. I want to write a letter, specifically to my Mother, make the case for calling me Morgen and her daughter.

Mental Health Post For Ponderance,kiwiwhovian,ainbow,"Long mental health post ahead:

TLDR: You are a computer, not a cake. You can reprogram your reality. You are not stuck being who you currently are.

A common misconception today is that you are a recipe. The ingredients of your childhood mix together, bake in your teens and when you're an adult you're the finished product, a cake if you will. 

But the problem with this is once you're a cake then that's it. You can't change what kind of cake you are or whether you are perfectly formed or a pile of burned mush. 

The truth though is that our brains run by electrical circuits and neurotransmitters. Our brains constantly learn and constantly evolve. This makes us more like computers. The good news about this is you can reprogram the beliefs you've learned, the character traits you've developed, the way you perceive people and the world. 

Unlike a cake which can't be deconstructed to its basic ingredients and changed once baked; a computer's programming can be rewritten, updated, or restored. 

You also can be rewritten, updated and restored. Trauma in your past, your environment, your socialisation, everything that has contributed to the person you are today can be examined and changed. It's not a quick fix, just like a computer you need time to work through the old and write in the new. Along the way you might need to shut down and reboot a few times, and afterwards there will still be some bugs to work out.

But change is not impossible. You are not a cake. You can change what you've learned to become. You can be who you want to be. Be patient, be kind to yourself, allow your growth to take place, look into your pain from an outside perspective, identify your limiting and your helpful beliefs, start believing in your new updates and the feelings and actions will follow.

"I'm a queer / gender queer woman, and suddenly pride triggers me",tobewastingmytime,ainbow,"Has anyone else experienced this?  

Sharing this feels raw and scary. I wanna preface by saying that I love all of you and I am so grateful for this community, and I don't want to upset anybody...  

When I first came out when I was 18 (I'm 24 now), it felt great to be ""out and proud"". I attended lgbtq+ events, I performed at local pride gigs, I dated, I experimented with my image, I found communities where my gender expression was celebrated, I educated myself, I educated family and friends...  

Now, I see marches, selfies, campaigns, insta posts etc. and for some reason I feel... angry? I feel frustrated. Sometimes I even find myself judging the people posting. I have thoughts like: ""this is stupid"" ""cringe"" ""why are you so caught up in this?"" sometimes I even laugh. I compare queer issues to other global issues and think ""stop creating more problems, we've got bigger things to worry about"". I have NEVER been that kind of person, this isn't me. I don't know where these emotions are coming from, or what exactly is triggering them but I'm not digging it.   

It's been a few months of this now, and I haven't brought it up with anyone, not even my partner because much of her life and work is dedicated to education and activism, and I don't want to diminish that. 

I know that it's totally okay for me to lead a happy quiet gay life, and not be loud about it if I don't want to, but it's not okay for me to place judgement on others, or feel upset by the actions of others. I don't know how to deal. Suddenly I feel like I'm not even a queer ally, and I AM queer. I want my community around me but I am triggered by it, which creates negative feelings and then guilt. So I feel myself stepping back.  

I have no idea where this is all coming from...   

I wondered if anyone had shared a similar experience."

My problem isn't with the intent of the movement or people participating, it's the fact that social media is the ""here and now"" of everything and is easily manipulated.

I get the whole intent but taking over the ""*Proud Boys*"" with gay men kissing seems more like we're just rehashing the whole ""that's gay"" phrase from the early 2000's. Sexuality shouldn't be weaponized as an insult. We're  also now talking about gay men as ""Proud Boys"" rather than the toxic  masculinity and white supremacist views of the actual domestic terrorist  organization. We should be calling them out, not taking them over. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills watching this unfold, but maybe I'm just too old?"

[TW] I used to be a Trump supporter in order to compensate for liking girls.,ihavehellaissues,ainbow,"
tw: homophobia, mentions of suicide 

Basically, I was a high school sophomore in 2016, and it was around this time that I really started thinking about girls. I grew up in a very conservative and religious environment, and I was always taught that being gay was a sin. I also grew up with a conservative and traditional culture, and I was always expected to grow up and marry a man and have a typical family.

I never liked boys though, and the one time that I kissed one, I felt disgusted for months afterwards. I just couldnt stand it. So while all of my friends were getting their first boyfriends, I just couldnt understand their interest. It wasnt until I saw my best friend smiling one day with the sun hitting her face in the most perfect way that I started to get a sense of what was going on.

I didnt even dare to think that I was anything other than straight, but when I went home that day, I couldnt stop crying bc I felt like there was something seriously wrong with me. At one point, I even passed out bc I couldnt breathe. 

With the 2016 election going on though, people in my community were picking their sides and voicing their thoughts. All of the prominent politicians of my ethnicity are Republican, and my upbringing consisted of Republican values. So I threw myself into politics. I wrote for right-wing media, got an internship with my local republican party, and helped with translations for the gop. At one point, I literally had an infamous right wing website and a couple Republican state senators following my instagram. I really somehow naively thought that I could just  republicanize the gay away. 

So in 2016, when Donald Trump was the Republican nominee, even though I couldnt vote, people around me knew clearly who I preferred. And I really thought that because I did all of this that I would have been fixed somehow. 

By the 2018 Midterm elections though, I was a changed person. I made relationships outside of my conservative ones, and my political views totally switched. I realized that my own personal beliefs didnt align with the conservative ones surrounding me and that I was very wrong in the past. However, I was still struggling immensely with my sexuality, and I felt so guilty about my previous political affiliation. Even though, I was never an extreme Republican in the sense that I was openly bigoted, I still sat at the same table as some of those people. I stayed quiet and forced laughs when they made terrible jokes and said awful sentiments. I was complicit in their racism, homophobia, and overall bigotry. There are still articles that I wrote as a Republican still floating around the internet. 

For the past two years, Ive been dealing with guilt and shame over my past. Im not expecting sympathy or kindness of any sort. Regardless of the fact that I truly didnt know better at the time, I still made the choices that I made. I hate 14-16 year old me with all of my heart, and I dont think that I deserve a future because of my past. 

Within the past year, Ive been able to admit to myself that Im not straight. I even came out to some of the people closest to me. But I feel like I dont deserve to be a part of the community bc of what Ive done and the beliefs that I used to hold. 

This past week, I started talking to a girl for the first time. like romantically talking. and it made me so happy. but then, i felt guilty again bc my parents might kick me out if they knew and bc i was falling short of my communitys expectations of me and bc the girl is great and she deserves someone who doesnt have such a bad past. 

I went to the beach today, and I couldnt stop crying. I still havent really. Because while at the beach, I was hit with the thought that maybe I would be better off dead. I feel like I dont deserve a future bc of my past, so whats the point? I work so hard in school and for what? My mom will never accept me for who I am. Ill never be able to live my life how I want, and Ill always have the burden of my old beliefs. Beliefs that still have a hold over me despite me doing my best to break free. 

Im still entertaining those thoughts, and I hoped writing everything down would help. I dont want to die necessarily. I just dont want to be this hurt anymore. Idk what else to say. If youve read through this, I apologize for wasting your time, and I also wanted to thank you for it."

How does one find out if they are bisexual or just gay?,Throwawayyy123451,ainbow,"I have never questioned my sexuality for the whole 18 years Ive been alive, because Ive always had crushes on girls (and the person Im speaking to romantically now is a girl). But recently one of my close friends came out as bisexual, and it got me curious. so one night when I was alone I searched up gay porn and enjoyed it... really enjoyed it, much more than straight porn (which I didnt really watch much anyway). 
Ive started noticing men are attractive too, but I cant see myself in a romantic relationship with a guy, but I guess i wouldnt mind having a sexual relationship (I dont think I could let someone put it in me, I tried prostate massage for a while, but It didnt really do anything for me). But said that, I like the idea of being with a girl, and feel I would enjoy sex just as much as I would with a guy... but Im just unsure to why I like gay porn more than straight. 

So my question is: how and when did you find out you were bisexual/gay, and what do you think I am? 

Ps: If I find out I am  I dont think I intend on coming out anytime soon (because of friends and family opinion)"

Is my sexuality somehow wrong or am I just being paranoid?,throwaway59731,ainbow,"Sorry if the title was overly dramatic, sorry for the throwaway account, and sorry that this is really long.

I'm a trans man and I'm one of the people whose sexuality has changed on hormones, so I'm going through this awkward phase of trying to rediscover my sexual orientation, and it's been made even more awkward by the fact that I'm pretty sure I know what my sexuality is and it's not one of the ""big five"", as it were. I've been using (in my brain only) the word femsexual. I'm not attracted to people based on gender, that idea doesn't even really make sense to me anymore. I'm only attracted to people based on whether they're feminine/feminine presenting (or androgynous sometimes). I want to stress that this has nothing to do with gender vs sex, obviously if I were attracted to just cis &amp; trans women I'd just be straight, it's about gender expression.

The main issue is, any time I see this term mentioned online it's in a context of ""this is bad"" or ""people who use this word are stupid"" and it's made me scared/unwilling to talk about my sexuality to anyone. Normally that wouldn't matter- I'm a practical person, I usually just use whatever is easiest and somewhat accurate, so I often just call myself straight. But sometimes I want to talk about things that are specific to my sexuality (like being attracted to a feminine-sounding man you only know over voice chat and worrying that he doesn't present fem/doesn't want to sound fem and might be offended by that) and I'm too scared to actually talk about it, which I think is a pretty unhealthy way to go about your life.

The most common things I've heard are things like ""you can't call yourself that because it's just a preference"" or ""you're clearly (whatever sexuality they are) and if you don't call yourself that it's offensive."" I guess the main issue I have is that it all feels very dismissive, like people start from the position of ""you're not allowed to be attracted to people based on anything but gender"" and based on that completely dismiss the possibility that it's anything but a ""preference.""

I guess I'm mostly asking, is this really an issue or am I just paranoid/focusing on negativity? And if you do think I'm wrong for using this word, can you please explain why in a way that's less dismissive than the stuff above (the phrasing, not the argument itself, I'm definitely not saying that if you have those opinions you're inherently being dismissive) or provide some alternative terms/phrases that are as descriptive? (""you don't need labels"" is a very nice sentiment but I'm kind of looking for a way to describe my sexuality so it's not really that useful here)

Sorry again that this was long and super anxious or self-hating sounding, every time I talk about this I feel like I'm 13 years old with an unmanaged anxiety disorder questioning my gender again and it's hard to avoid sounding like it in writing."

"To victims of Conversion Therapy, I need your help",Lydia_Corsicana,ainbow,"My state recently failed to pass a ban on conversion therapy. While those in support of the ban are regrouping and preparing to try again, several state house *Republicans* are performing a ""study"" to see if the benefits outweigh the risks. These same House Republicans are attempting to create legislation that would actually make conversion therapy MORE accessible to parents and guardians. It is the most blatantly biased thing I've ever seen.

The study consists of interviewing an unspecified number of people. An unspecified percentage of the interviewees will be therapists and psychiatrists who practice conversion therapy. Allowing practitioners to partake in this is extremely biased and unethical. 

Here is what I need from anyone who is willing: I just want your story and experience with Conversion Therapy. Be as brutally honest as possible about the harmful effects the practice has. People need to know how not ok it is. 

Anybody who is willing to help me with this, you can message your story to me here on reddit or email it to ban.ct.petition@gmail.com or if there is another method you are more comfortable with, I'll see if I can make it happen. Everyone will remain anonymous.


I need as many eyes to see this as possible. I need as many responses as possible. I want these fuckers to feel the hurt and pain that they are causing. Who knows, if I can get enough support from within my state and from elsewhere, maybe I can convince my ""baby trump"" governor to ban it with an executive order.

I am trans (MtF) and growing up never had any opportunity to read anything featuring a trans character. Since coming out I've come across a few good short stories and other things, but I'm wondering what stories, books, comics etc, that feature trans characters do you all like and would recommend?

Also because of my lack of finding these stories when I was young, I wrote my own and partnered with a trans artist to do the illustrations. You can find out more about it and/or support it at Kickstarter by searching The Story of Nib. 

But I'd really like to know what you've come across that you've liked!"

Was I in the wrong for telling my homophobic bully I hope his children wake up without a father tomorrow?,popheassucker,ainbow,"
Okay so Matt bullied me in high school for being gay. He would tell me Im gonna get AIDS and need a colostomy bag by 30 because Im disgusting.

Fast-forward ten years, were in our late 20s now. He has a wife and two kids. Im living on my own, have a good job that I love, and Im in an unorthodox relationship but it works and Im happy with where my life is, especially for my age.

Well...Facebook is a thing. I noticed on my feed that a friend of mine was getting in an argument with Matt about families and how she was a failure because shes unmarried after college and working a front-desk job. I chimed in that not married and Im doing just fine for myself.

He said I didnt ask what some AIDS-ridden f*g has to say. And then I exploded at him. I Called him a fat fuck, his wife is a miserable fat cunt of a partner and I feel sorry for his kids and I hope they wake up without a father tomorrow.

He immediately blocked me after that, and the friend PMd me saying that while she appreciates me backing her up, I just made things worse on her end and I was over the line with my comments. She actually told me that shes pretty mad at me because I kinda fucked up her day and now people are asking her about me.

Look, This dude clearly has had the same mentality for decades now. I honestly would love it if he dropped dead today. Shouldnt I have the right to hurt him the same way he hurt me? Arent I entitled to that, even? Whats the big deal here?"

How does an MM/gay relationship differ from a MF/heterosexual relationship?,bakedpotatos136,ainbow,"I don't want to sound like a way off misogynist, but besides being sexually attracted to women, I just can't make a connection with them, on either a romantic or an intellectual level. I have this thing, it feels like this core of me, my soul, who I am, the very most inner heart of me. And from my experience, I'd have to be a fool to give it to a woman. I think I would become a homosexual, but only for the sake of being able to connect. I would most likely be looking for a mtf transexual, because I am still attracted to women, but they have to have a male soul.

"Thought I was just super extra about being an ally. Turns out, I'm not an ally oops",LandofLemons,ainbow,"Throughout highschool I thought I was asexual. Because I wasn't into men like that, the things other girls would say about guys kind of grossed me out. I toyed with the idea of being lesbian, but didn't think it fit since I'd had crushes on guys. 

I briefly dated a girl in high school. It was a pretty toxic relationship, and a lot of the reason I was with her was because she was deeply depressed and I didn't want to make it worse. I pushed her away until she broke up with me- so that I didn't have to break up with her. Absolutely awful of me! 

I got really interested in religion, and she got upset that I wanted to attend church or hang out with female friends of mine. I am deeply interested in human spirituality, so it really sucked when she tried to guilt me into spending time with her instead of on religion or with other friends.In addition we were never exclusive, I was pretty clear about that but she would try to guilt me by talking about how she ""wouldn't date anyone else"" and I would just say ""that's your choice"". When she broke up with me she mentioned a bunch of things she hated about me, I said ""okay I understand, and respect your decision"" and she got mad at me for ""not fighting for the relationship"" which was weird to say the least. We both really sucked. 

Anyway, after we broke up I could finally  start going to a church with this girl I really wanted to be friends with, without the ex's disapproval. 

I got really into religion, but was a little scared people would learn about my past. The church was non-affirming, but ultimately I told friends of mine I had dated a girl but wasn't into women anymore (true at the time), and they were very kind about it. I was reluctant about who I'd tell since I didn't want people to use me as an example of an ex-gay. I wanted it to be clear that sexuality can be fluid, especially for women. I was also open about the fact that I would 100% date a trans guy-since trans men are men. Which was a bit of an issue apparently? 


Life carried on, I developed a crush on a really nice boy and we dated briefly. Only, I was not ready for a relationship so I ended things. 

Fast forward a couple of years-in which I had only had crushes on men (but would occasionally see specific women, and go ""omw she's so gorgeous, I'd totally date her. Only, I'm straight/asexual""  (by straight I mean heteroromantic). Or ""oh no I can't talk to her for too long, she'll think I'm into her"" (which is totally normal and definitely something that goes through people's heads all the time) or maybe even a fun ""she seems gay, maybe she'll think I'm gay"". Anywho I felt very comfortable with the idea of being heteroflexible but definitely asexual. 

A friend of mine came out to me, and I was like ""oh cool, if you need lesbian sex ed resources I know a couple and can help you out! Love you kiddo"" anyway. I thought I was just kind of extra about allyship. Apparently it's not regular for a straight/ace girl to watch tons of lesbian sex ed content??? 

I left that church, and delved deeper into different expressions of Christianity, Judaism, and different religions like Sikhism, the Baha'i faith, Mahayana Buddhism, Jainism, etc. I even took classes some religious places offered. At this point I'd removed all the shame I had felt around the idea of sex and sexuality, and I was pretty solid with myself but also pretty sure my sexuality had shifted and I was no longer into women (at the time I dated the girl it was like 95% into women/5% men). I was pretty open about being affirming too. 

So, beginning of this year. I'm at another church's small group type thing. I meet this woman, we'll call her Hyacinth and the moment I see her, I have my little ""she gay? She's gonna think I'm gay oh no!"" moment--so we know I'm attracted to her haha. Throughout the year I try to avoid talking to her alone, and once the small group moves online that's not an issue anyway. Disaster strikes when a little while ago I saw her in person. Again with my ""she's so pretty, oh no she's going to think I'm into her"" moment. So we chat a bit, and there is a seat near her (equally near another person) and my brain just goes ""you can't sit there she's going to think you're into her"" (super normal lol). I did sit there, but was very aware of myself the entire time. 

There was another church thing, we could go to, and I asked if I could have a ride with her (it took me ages to ask, because I didn't want to seem weird-usually I don't worry about carpooling with people). She agrees, and we go together. The entire time I'm aware of myself more than usual, and worried she's going to think I'm gay. 

Once we got back, we had a chat about sexuality and how I'm affirming but I accidentally implied I'm straight (to be fair, at this point I was still in denail about the very obvious crush I have on her). Then text my (lesbian) friend about how I think I'm a bit attracted to this woman. I start explaining and she calls. She then says ""aren't you super asexual"" and what came out was ""only when it comes to men"". Anyway my friend started connecting the dots and goes ""well your fashion sense, is great and also really gay. Also, your glasses are gay. Your phone case is clear. And you offered to help me with lesbian sex ed once."" 

So there you have it. I'm a bit queer (please do not try to label my sexuality, I'm not asking. I am very comfortable with ""queer"" and being on the asexual spectrum. My sexuality is fluid, and I'm fine with it).

I was deeply in denial because I said things like ""oh but all women feel that way sometimes"" or ""it's very rare for me to like women, so I'm straight"". I wasn't really homophobic--the church I grew up in blesses same sex unions, and ordains openly gay +lesbian clergy so it wasn't an issue. My mom had even said she doesn't mind who I date (man/woman/same culture/different culture) as long as I'm happy. But I don't know that telling people in my life is necessary, I don't feel the need to. I'm not at all ashamed, I just don't care enough to make it a conversation topic irl. 

Also, to reiterate, I messed up by implying I'm straight- how do I fix that? 

Lastly, shout out to my friend for realising I was experiencing gay panic and being scared someone was going to think I was gay because I sat in a free seat nearby, is not a regular straight girl activity. 

If you got through that mess, fantastic! Much love. And thanks for letting me reflect on my silliness. 

To be clear, my parents told me it was weird to be gay/trans. And would say some homophobic/transphobic things in my younger years, but as I progressed through highschool and uni their views changed and they had a chat with me explaining that it's totally fine, and as long as I'm happy they're happy and God doesn't mind people expressing love a little differently. Over time the church had become more and more explicit in their status as affirming, which probably helped, but I'd assume it was also their exposure to different people over time. I just personally didn't have an issue with it, especially since an instructor of mine was gay and I thought he was just swell."

Ok, so I need help or advice because I honestly dont know how I should feel or go about this situation. I started talking to this a few weeks ago; everything was going great with chatting, FaceTime, and just overall talking. One day last week, they finally came over to my place for dinner, which I cooked, and I thought everything was going well. Towards the end, they wanted to cuddle and just get close. I was all for it, but then they wanted to go further, and I didnt wanna go that quick right then there; after all this was the first time Ive met the guy face to face. We did some small stuff but nothing extreme. Overall it seemed like the date went well; they seemed interested wanted to make plans for next week, which was great! We kept talking and FaceTimeing all the way up until about two days before our second date, and I get hit with the hey ur real cool, really cute, and what not blah blah blah. But I only see us as friends. I cant help but think I got taken advantage of.... they only wanted me for my body. I keep thinking to myself that I got taken advantage of and they only wanted me for my body, but because I wanted to take things slow, theyre not interested in a relationship like they said they wanted. My mind is in a million places. I dont feel like Im in the right headspace. Its making me depressed that someone would potentially use me like this. I dont know if it was they wanted to take advantage of me and my body, that they genuinely dont see us compatible, or I just wasnt good at that small stuff on first date. I tried reaching out they said I was fine and cute but only see me as a friend. Because of this statement, I keep thinking to myself they only wanted me for my body, and its eating me inside just thinking that. Please, anyone, do you have advice, tips, or suggestions to bring my thoughts and brain back to normal? Sorry it was so long. My head isn't in the fight mindset and I would love other people's point of view. Thanks

Queer Handbook,SuperMaxi2161,ainbow,"I went to a bookstore with my family earlier today and I noticed a book titled This Book is Gay. I was intrigued. I discreetly read the back and it explained that it was basically the fabled gay/queer handbook, which just made me want it more. The only problem is I might as well be in Narnia. The only people Im out to is my mom and some online friends. My family is 100% straight allies but Im deeply ashamed of anything queer. The way I saw it is I had 4 options:

1. Do nothing, dont get the book

2. Steal the book, get the book, if anyone finds out Im fucked

3. Covertly buy the book, option 2. but I lose 10 dollars 

4. Overtly buy the book, out myself there and then, get the book, be ashamed

Fear of being 100% myself,sadfruit-,ainbow,"hi everyone, in a 22 year old guy who identifies as gay however i have been struggling with being ready to be my authentic self. Growing up i didnt know any gay people or have any LGBTQ+ friends so i always felt so alone and never had anyone to talk to about how i was feeling. It took me a while to accept myself and im starting to get to a place where im realizing that i cant go on lying about this part of me because i will never be happy. but im still so scared to share it with everyone I know. I have come out to 2 friends and they have been supportive but every-time i try to bring it up to my family or other friends i break down and never have the courage to do it.  I dont want to pretend to be something im not i want to be happy but this fear always wins. My family is also pretty conservative and i know they would eventually come around but they will be disappointed and look at me differently even if they accept me. I have a good relationship with my parents so it breaks my heart to think that by being who i am would make them look at me differently and ruin our close knit family. Everytime i think I have the courage to tell my parents, something happens, not too long ago we were watching a movie with a gay couple and there was somewhat of a sex scene and both of them said things about how gross it was. Hearing that from the people you love and knowing that they so outwardly disapprove of what you are shatters any confidence or hope i think i am starting to have. 

I have suffered from depression a lot these last few years and I think a huge part of my fear is that coming out will change my relationships with family and friends and I will go back to a dark place. and once i come out i fear i will still be alone because i dont know anyone closely that identifies as a member of the lgbt community. I want to be able to tell my mom and brother about a boy i fall in love with one day and have them be excited but what if they never come around and i have to live without the closet people in my life to talk to about something so important to me??

I did this 3  times, then the fourth time he said that he wanted me to visit him again  but he said that when he was horny. When he wasnt horny I never really  existed, The thing is that I didn't have a problem with driving 6h for  him, because I loved him and I cared about him. I wanted him to feel  safe with me and that I am always there for him. Today we have lost our  snapchat streak, he hasn't opened my snap in 2 days and I can feel how  we are drifting apart. I just hoped that he could see how much I  sacrificed to be with him."

Feeling isolated and dejected,hopelesslonelygay,ainbow,"I must have opened and closed the Reddit app on my phone 20 times before writing this post. It seems like the rate of responses vary wildly on here with the hour of the day or which community is posted to, so it's entirely possible that no one will even see this and that thought kind of devastated me when thinking about posting about my feelings to Reddit. Experience is making it hard for me to believe that anyone will care about my feelings or what I have to say even if it is seen, but I don't really know what else to do. I'm not in a good place and I don't have another outlet at the moment. I may cross post this so sorry if you see it more than once and are bothered by that.

It used to be when waking up, I would feel better than I did when I went to sleep and that would last at least a few hours, but now almost every day, even after getting to talk with one of the very few friends who seem to have time and the inclination to talk to me since the pandemic started to wear everyone down so much the day before, I just wake up feeling suicidal. I feel motivation and passion for anything very rarely and when I do it's gone before I can gather the strength to latch onto it and try to at least have a distraction from how badly I feel unless that motivation is for passive dopamine hits like checking social media, tv, food, or porn.

No one reaches out to me. All my friends and family live with someone, either romantic partners or family, and no one has any motivation or desire to reach out to me during this pandemic because they have so little energy and what little they have is taken up by work or school or just how tough life is right now for everyone. I don't begrudge them feeling that way, but none of them are isolated like I am and they seem to be satisfied with their interactions with their partners or family whom they live with. I won't go so far to say that I have no one, I have at very least a couple very good friends whom I get to talk with a couple times a month each, but it's really not enough. My best days pre-pandemic seemed to be when I had at least three social interactions with different people per day. Now I'm getting nothing almost. When I reach out, when I say I'm having a problem, when I say explicitly this is what's going on and this is what I need, I am met with resistance, passitivity, and am kept at arm's length. People have to set healthy boundaries for themselves and look out for themselves before they can help others, but I need more support than what I'm getting. I have tried to check up on most of my closer social circle several times since the pandemic started in March, and I can only think of a few scant instances where those same people initiated contact with me to check on how I was doing, even after weeks or months of no communication. I feel like I have to threaten self harm to get anyone to care just for a second, and then they disappear immediately anyway.

There are a handful of men in my life whom I've developed feelings for over the years, half of whom I've told and not been accepted but not been outright rejected either and have then been encouraged, explicitly or implicitly, to flirt or make passes at them or they will flirt and make passes at me, but they never follow through with romance or lust or they will occasionally but then immediately get freaked out and retreat. The other half I'm terrified that if I told them it would destroy our friendship and quite possibly an entire social circle for me, which is especially terrifying because I have made it a policy in life to only keep close those who I feel a genuine connection and friendship with, so my friend list is limited, despite having many acquaintances whom I enjoy and hope to develop a deeper friendship with. Even the ones whom I have not told sometimes flirt with me, have sent sexual pictures, have kissed me with tongue in public, and it's all very confusing. I can't know for sure if they are confused sexually themselves, if they feel pity for me, or even if they can be trusted to tell themselves the truth and not rewrite their history so as to be comfortable in their image of heterosexuality they put forth and therefore if they can be trusted to tell me the truth of what they feel. Sometimes they talk about their feelings or attraction to me and then deny it later. Their gaslighting behavior and our relationships have caused me to feel paranoid about men a lot of the time, which was something I have struggled with ever since puberty, so my male friends I have are rare and very precious to me. Even when I reach out and try to instigate contact with new guys on apps or whatnot, I feel like I get ignored the vast majority of the time. No one seems to want to actually have a deeper conversation, be that about our individual feelings, our society, academic type critique of media or arts, or even how our days were. I still feel a deep connection and affection for the previously mentioned men who are a part of my life whom I have feelings for, but their gay panic always seems to derail things despite the signals they give off and their actions that say that they are attracted to and hold affection for me. I just never seem to be enough for them to follow through.

I'm feeling very hopeless right now. I have dreams and aspirations I wish I could focus on or care about, but the lack of human attention and support has made me a lump on the couch with no interests or trust for new relationships, platonic or romantic. This is not new/caused by the pandemic, but it has been immensely amplified by it.

I feel as though if I could have more social support, be it romantic or friendship, if I could feel that consistency and support, I would be able to put my energy and concentration into the projects and dreams and aspirations I have that don't involve dating or having a family of my own. But I am just so lonely and depressed and without a good support system, that I am emotionally raw all the time and I cannot concentrate on or conjure up motivation for any kind of endeavor, even basic health and upkeep of myself or my home most of the time. I try to focus on and be grateful for the good things in my life, the fact that I have a home, that I have food, that I am able to acquire what medication I need, that I am fortunate enough to be able to make occasional frivolous purchases just for fun, and not have to choose between an appetizer or dessert when I order in, but what is any of that worth without friends, family, or a romantic partner? 

I don't really know what I'm hoping to get out of posting this, or how it might contribute to others, but thanks for reading anyway."

An apology to the LGBT community from a former radical truscum,Baharnaz,ainbow,"I'm going to cut clean to the chase. I'm 16 FTM and I used to be an exclusionist and a bigot towards my brothers, sisters, and enby pals in my own community and I desperately want to change for the better. For a very long time, particularly in the beginning of my transition, I was very insecure in myself and harbored a lot of internalized transphobia. All my life, I was conditioned to be this perfect daughter to my parents which led me to think very negatively about myself and my transition. In an effort to be seen as ""valid"" and to be accepted by the general population, I fell back onto harmful transmed ideology. Now I understand this is a controversial issue but this is not about having dysphoria or not. It became something much more toxic than that debate, with radical transmeds like Kalvin Garrah using their platform to harass and bully young trans teens who did not fit the perfect stereotypical definition of trans. Young people, discovering and expressing themselves in new ways only to be humiliated online by radical transmeds who deemed them as ""trenders"" to mock them. And I, in my own insecurity and need for validation, stupidly used to support this without considering how much it was hurting them.

My mindset at the time was to be as stealth, as gender-conforming of a trans man as possible, pushing away any feminine things I loved, to be seen as valid and to prove myself to be a ""better trans"" than those who did not fit the stereotype. I was so caught up reading terribly bigoted forums like lolcow and trying to find validation from radical transmeds and conservatives. It was horribly toxic not just to myself, but to others. Our community is meant to be a safe, supportive space to celebrate our uniqueness and I had endorsed a toxic mindset that brought harm and disunity to that. Dividing the community because of internalized discrimination and hate is the last thing I want to happen. Gender expression, identity, and presentation are so diverse and beautiful and it is such a shame to see people with unique experiences and expression be shot down by insecure people who do not deem them ""trans or valid enough"". I do love feminine things, I love wearing nail polish and dresses and just because I feel more comfortable presenting masc, it does not mean others are less valid or less trans. No matter your identity, everyone should be in a space that welcomes your expression because you are beautiful (and handsome!) and amazing just the way you are. I am so sorry for not seeing that sooner and for supporting a rhetoric that had told you otherwise. Have a great day everyone."
Nervous about using they/them pronouns,Current_Anybody,ainbow,"Im AFAB and have been wanting to try using both they/them pronouns for a while now. I currently use she/her pronouns and while I dont necessarily mind it, I hate the gender confirming titles that come with it (ex. Ms, Maam, etc).

The issue Im having is Im too nervous to actually tell people my preferred pronouns. I appear relatively feminine (though I dress more neutrally) so Im worried that 1. No one will use they/them pronouns cause of my appearance or 2. No one will support it if I say it. The only person Ive asked to use they/them pronouns with is my therapist because I knew shed be accepting of it. 

How did you folks who have changed your pronouns navigate this?"

Hey everyone ,georgerickyoski,ainbow, 
Trying to Become an Openly Gay Rapper in a Conservative Neighborhood...Thoughts?,faxmaddick,ainbow,"Hey all, I'm 21 years old. Came out to my family and friends at 18. I escaped my conservative suburb to go to college but due to recent COVID related events I've been forced to come back home. School, hangouts and everything else is online now and life is kind of boring, but it's just as well, cause let's just say it's not too fun going on public gay dates here!

So, In my spare time, I've decided to become an openly gay rapper. I've always been a huge fan of hip-hop, but felt like the genre was hypocritically prejudiced against gay people for having so many themes of empowerment and being yourself.

A lot of the straight people I've grown up around have really romanticized the idea of ""not caring"" about someone being gay. While it's definitely better than being outwardly homophobic, I don't really vibe with that because sexuality is integrated into so many aspects of people's lives, including music. I want people to feel PROUD to be gay, not just like you should thank someone else for not caring. My goal here is to represent my community and diversify hip-hop, and so I figured I'd try and find some actually qualified gay people on the internet to find to get feedback on my music, since most my friends are straight!

Here's a track I've released recently, please let me know what you think! Really looking for the right people to hear this and give their opinions!

Gender Neutral Pronouns Issue (kind of a vent),Mirality-,ainbow,"(English isn't my first language, so i apologize in advance)  


On the last few weeks there has been a issue on brazilian twitter, in which ""SJWs"" are apparently ""forcing"" others to accept and use gender neutral pronouns in case you don't know someone's gender or they're nonbinary.  It's even more problematic here considering that there are NO SUCH THING AS GENDER NEUTRAL WORDS ON PORTUGUESE; so they're creating them

  
Some people believe that they want to ""destroy the portuguese language"" creating pronouns and articles such as ""elu"" and ""u/e"" (which is an obvious strawman, but sure).

  
A lot of people are addressing the issue and making fun of eachother online. Unfortunately, there's a lot of transphobia in the middle of it.

  
I've never been so sad seeing such things before; it's a shitstorm, where in Twitter AND Youtube people are just using it to justify their transphobia and it's sickening me. I never used Twitter much, but I basically live on YT and, there, people are saying stuff like: ""There's no such thing as nonbinary"", ""I'm a washing machine, pls respect my gender!!!"", ""When one of you ""no-binaries"" commit suicide, i'll celebrate with fireworks"" (found all those comments, on a [video](https://youtu.be/G8fXMbLEat4) mocking the issue, in less than 5 minutes -- even tho it's also addressed to them)

  
I understand it's stupid to force and cancel people to use certain pronouns, even more when they're made up, but is it really necessary to act like that?   
Maybe it's because i'm a little down and feeling insecure, but i feel like i need a second opinion from someone other than my friends. Is it really bad to create words to include new types of people?(remodelling a big aspect of the language)

  
I don't know, exactly, what was my objective while writing this. I guess I just needed to tell someone since this toxicity is messing me a little."

We spend our evenings being loud and doing splits in the back and making fun of the crazy shit we go through out in the dining room. But more importantly, we are a light in the dark.

My (20F) friend (19M) and my roommate (19F) starting dating and now one of them won't talk to me and I can't decide if its my fault bc I had sex with my roommate,Sun_Creepy48,ainbow,"This is really long and complicated interpersonal relationship stuff, so I'm really sorry in advance for that. I'm just trying to figure out of my confusion with my sexuality is affecting my judgement with this issue, but I'm not sure if this is the right place for this. 

Basically, I (20 F) am a junior in college. I transferred to the school I'm at now because in my freshmen year, I had some really shitty stuff happen to me with my friends at my old school. They basically informed me they all had never liked me and didn't want to be friends with me a month or two before the year was over, and it was the hardest time in my life. The only friend I still have from that year is my friend, also a junior (19 M) I'll call him Steve. Steve has been my friend for over two years now. When we first met, he had a big crush on me. I don't really date, and I have since learned I am a lesbian, but at the time I wasn't sure and he kept asking me out so I did go out with him but ended up deciding we were better as friends and he eventually got over it. He was there for me as our other friends pushed me away and he was very upset when I decided to transfer.

This brings me to my sophomore year. I transferred in with no expectations and a lot of trust issues, but ended up making the best and closest group of friends anyone could have asked for. One of these friends was my current roommate, I'll call her Valerie. She was my closest friend I made, we just get along super well. Even though she had a boyfriend at the time, we ended up sleeping together while drunk. This was a very big deal for me, as I am still trying to figure out my sexuality and whatnot, but she says she was just experimenting and its not a big deal. At first it was a major issue and she made me promise not to tell anyone, but I am very bad at keeping secrets so it got out and now its kind of a joke in our friend group.

Steve this whole time had been having trouble making new friends at our old school, so every once and a while he would ask to come and visit me. My friends all thought he had a huge crush on me still, including Valerie, who tried to encourage it. They got along really well and the rest of my friends didn't like him, so eventually I would go out with just the two of them. When quarantine happened I was on spring break, with just Steve and Valerie. This was the last time I saw Steve in person. Valerie and I ended up going back to our school just the two of us after that before our school was fully shut down, and for that week we lived pretty much as one person, in the same bed going to each others zoom lectures, and we did sleep together one more time. When we left to go home for quarantine, the first few months we were all super close. We talked and zoomed constantly, and I helped Valerie talk through all of her personal problems, including breaking up with her boyfriend at the end of May, and getting kicked out of her house in March. Shortly after that though, about two weeks after, she started dating my friend Steve. This started some conflict. One of my other friends suggested that she be sensitive to my feelings on the matter because Steve and I had dated and me and Valerie had had a relationship before. She promised she would be. However, I haven't felt like she has been and I struggled with that. I also struggled with bringing it up to her, because I am the kind of person where if I have an issue with you you're gonna know, but I didn't want to add to her problems when she had so many already. Over the course of June, their relationship progressed very quickly. They never went on dates, she actually just lives at his house every weekend. At the beginning of July they told each other they loved each other. All of us in the friend group think that is unhealthy and don't like their relationship.

What ended up starting the issues with Steve is a little unclear to me. Like I said, Valerie usually talks to me and asks my opinions on things. She asked my opinions on her relationship. I honestly told her I thought it moved way too fast, but that I've never been in a relationship and I could be wrong. She told me she was fine with that and she understood. However, apparently she told Steve I said this. I had no idea this happened and at this point I was starting to feel bad I had had all these unfounded weird feelings about their relationship so I reached out to apologize to him for any weirdness and sort of make sure our friendship was good. He didn't respond. I sent him two more messages apologizing for anything I did to upset him and he didn't reply for days. At this point I was extremely upset. I felt like I was right back in freshmen year. All my friends from my new school knew I was upset, so Valerie told him to reply. He sent me a message telling me he still loved me he just didn't like how I was talking about his relationship. This really confused and upset me because I had never mentioned his relationship to him. I told him I was upset he ignored me and didn't even tell me he was upset. He replied telling me he was sorry for not replying but he needed time because anything I say to her will go to him and vice versa and both he and Valerie both agreed that I had made multiple unrequested comments that had crossed the line. This really confused and upset me so I immediately asked Valerie, who called me crying saying she had betrayed my trust and was never upset with me. She also informed me the reason she thinks he's upset is because she thinks he thinks I'm trying to steal her from him. When she became homeless I started offering for her to come live with me. But when where she has been living now got really bad, both me and Steve offered for her to come stay. She picked me and said she was more comfortable with me. However she ended up abruptly changing her mind. She told me it was because he said I made that offer to take her from him. This is very hurtful to me not to mention also insane. I told him she didn't have an issue and had asked for my opinion so I wasn't sure why he had an issue with me. I said that him ignoring me and not even bothering to tell me he was upset was hurting me. That was nine weeks ago and he hasn't spoken to me since.

I have moved into school since then and Valerie and I are roommates now. It has caused a few issues. Both of us get along too well to not be fine, but there is underlying tension and hurt. She has asked me to reach out to him but I feel like that's not my job at this point. I told him I was upset but he doesn't seem to care. I can't be the only one who cares in a friendship again. I feel he is jealous because back when we were friends I did tell him we had sex because he was just my friend to confide in he didn't know her, or now that he doesn't have a crush on me he doesn't care anymore about our relationship. She insists that he cares but he just needs time, but the way I see it, I haven't done anything he deserves time for. I can't tell if I'm the one causing conflict for holding a grudge or if I am holding a bias and have feelings for her and started this by being petty and because of that I'm hurting her and a good relationship for her. All my other friends hate him and are on my side, but I feel bad for that as well, she can't talk to them. I can't tell if I'm causing problems because I probably like her or if I actually have reasons to be upset and not talking to Steve.

Just don't know what to do anymore.,shinobitrash,ainbow,"Lately, I just feel disconnected from the world around me. I've only been in 3 real relationships in my life, and intimate with only 5 people total. All of them have been women. I've always known I was attracted to men though. It was solidified after my old roommate kissed me in the rain because I told him I had always wished my first kiss was like Seth Cohen and Summer from the oc, and he said ""Well, at least your first kiss with a guy can be."" Now, I'm hopeless.

Anyways, that was around the time of my last relationship, and I have been with two women after that. It hasn't ever felt right since. I don't find myself attracted to women much any more these days, and I've accepted and come to terms with that. My dilemma is I never have any luck meeting guys who express interest in me besides quick hookups. I've downloaded just about every app I can think of and nothing comes from it. It's been 2 years. I fear it's me and my overbearing anxiety/mild ocd which makes me terrible at texting. 

I guess the main thing I'm trying to say is I don't know how to fit in and insert myself in daily life much less a whole new world/culture that I'm not familiar with. I don't have any LGBTQ guy friends, so lately I've  just given up and become somewhat reclusive. Do you guys have any advice on putting yourself out there and creating a meaningful connection and friendship. 

I'm so sorry for ranting and putting this here. I just feel kind of lost in life lately."

Mixed-orientation marriage help?,vamospineapple,ainbow,"Ok, lets get this rollercoaster started, and my question is at the end :

My wife and I have been married for 2 1/2 years. We met in 2014. An incident at a party had me asking her if she was bi, which she said she felt she was.

We tried poly so she could express her bisexuality. It has always been super important to me that she feels able to express her happiest self. But it quickly burned out as she just wasnt putting in effort or connecting with the girls and couples.

The relationship got so rocky you could start climbing it, but earlier this year she watched Feel Good and I showed her Philosophy Tubes Queer  video. She vibed hard with the video, and sat down and we talked and came out to me as mostly gay.

Relationship continued rocky, as she felt she just couldnt put in effort to stay with me. So I called time, and we began separation. I was sleeping on the couch while I found a new place, but wed both agreed that we were going to hook up with other people out of respect. Then she brought a girl home after a drunken night out and their escapades woke me up. I packed up at 3am and moved out by midday.

She was distraught that shed done that, but she somehow had a moment of clarity a day later where she, for the first time with absolute, total surety to both me and herself, said Im gay.

After she came out, everything made sense as to why my efforts to help her feel comfortable hadnt worked, why she felt she was anxious about being with me; she was a lesbian and she felt she was living a lie.

But in the week since then......weve had sex. Multiple times. We talk about moving back in together. Getting back together and having a poly thing with a female third or a polycule so her and I can both see separate girls.

She said shes sure she gay, she has absolutely no interest or desire in men.....except me. She says I dont count as just another guy, I somehow skirt the rules and she says shes wildly attracted to me. Im more than ok with this!

Heres the question though; theres a ton of magazine articles, interviews, etc. about women who leave their husbands for women, but I cant find anything to help us navigate the topic of a lesbian woman choosing to stay with her husband because shes still attracted to him.

Please drop your links to any good resources on this topic below! Any advice in good faith from personal experience is welcome too, and Ill do my best to reply as much as I can (nursing exams keep me pretty busy!).

Thank you, everyone! "

Ive gained weight during quarantine which I hate. Its from stress, drinking too much, and a medication that slows my metabolism. I do resistance training 4-5 times a week and I average 5 miles traveled on foot a day, yet I still see myself ballooning. Ive even tried purging multiple times but I dont have much of a gag reflex to speak of.

I fucking hate myself now and I refuse to love myself until Im hit again. I used to be shredded 57 male 140 lbs 8% body fat, now Im a truly disgusting 160 lbs 15% body fat. I dont deserve to be happy with myself until Im hot, my friends think thats ludicrous but I need to have this. I am literally nobody without my looks. I genuinely would rather die than be ugly.

They hate it when I call myself a disgusting cow but I am! They think Im being too hard on myself but I deserve to be! They all look great and I dont. They carry their weight well (a few of them are technically overweight but theyre still hot as hell in their own ways; I dont judge people for their weight, but its different when its my body. Its my own body to hate and I genuinely would rather hate myself and be fit than love myself and be fat.

Now of course just because something is statically dangerous, that doesn't mean it is necessarily wrong. But I had to admit to myself that I didn't know the real reason for why Homosexuals have such high STD rates. As a mostly straight person, I don't have a full grasp for Gay history. I don't really have a supported answer as to why STD rates are higher in Gay Men. Does anybody know the history and science behind the high statistics in homosexuals with STDs?"

Should I lie to my psychiatrist so I can go off the medication he prescribed so I lose weight?,secretlynotintowomen,ainbow,"Ive gained ten-fifteen pounds since I started my new medication a couple months ago. Its a mood stabilizer that, if it causes facial or muscle ticks, should be stopped immediately. It also causes weight gain.

Ive experienced the weight gain, not the ticks, but Im thinking about telling my doc that Im experiencing ticks because he told he wouldnt take me off the medication for weight gain alone, and Id rather be thin and crazy than fat and sane.

Should I just lie to him and tell him that so I can be attractive again?

The medication (a mood stabilizer) does help me somewhat but now I hate my body because I used to be super fit but now Im not and I cant stand that. 

I went from 57 male 150 lbs 8% body fat to 160-165 lbs 15% body fat. I feel hideous.

I never judge others for their weight but its my body to hate and I need to hate how I look in order to improve because if I love myself I get lazy and gain weight, its happened before.

And everyone tells me from my doctors to my parents to my friends that Im overreacting. I dont think I am! I dont judge others for their weight and in fact Im into bears but I personally hate not being skinny! I hate it! I dont feel like Im a person when Im not skinny and thats the truth. And I would NEVER tell another person that (seriously, I DO NOT JUDGE PEOPLE FOR THEIR WEIGHT) but I need to self-hate to actually be a person others want to be around, otherwise I become a lazy fuck nobody wants.

subtle queer flirting (close friend) ?,Narwhal_Songs,ainbow,"Sooo... 

how do i subtly/discreetly flirt with my close friend who might/might not feel the same way (romantic, possibly sexual (i've been ace up till now so not sure if this is sex attraction ?)?

What I wish is for a relationship,  (and also some makeing out) but I would be fine if things stayed the way they are, we both really appreciate each other and our friendship (so I do not want to ruin it.) 

We've been friends for a few years now and I had a MAD crush on him in the beginning but got rejected. Since then we've grown closer as friends and I realised I'm not over him, but rather the feelings are stronger ( and i've never before had sexual feelings when I've been in love with someone).  I wouldn't act on it if it were not for him leaving mixed signals. There's been casual touching (he's not the touchy-feely kind), prolonged eye contacts, increase in compliments, physical closeness, we've stood close to each other. But at the same time, we ARE close friends and I like to look at and touch my close friends. 

I've been watching/googling ""signs a guy like you"" and ""how to flirt"" but its usually so straight. And we re both very queer, different genders but very queer. 

Sooo... I could use some help?"

We don't know any gay folks who have pursued a family and I've always valued personal experience as a means of advice. I'd love to hear your story of becoming/living as gay parents! Specifically, here's what's been on my mind:

1. Are there any organizations that specifically help LGBT+ people with the adoption process? (Legal advice, connection with gay-friendly adoption agencies, etc.)
2. Are there any family-oriented LGBT+ communities or resources where I can connect with people in a similar/relatable situation?
3. What are some challenges that are unique to gay parents? Do you run into problems with schools/hospitals/institutions because of your family situation?

Attracted to my straight male best friend. He might love me back?,Indeed_Me,ainbow,"I'm ftm trans guy, on T for 2 years, passing 100% and I've made post about me and my best male straight friend here few days ago https://old.reddit.com/r/AskGayMen/comments/ino61q/i_fell_for_my_straight_male_friend_the_first_guy/

Nowdays, our bond is getting stronger day by day and more signs appear to make me think he, if not attracted to me back, he has strong feelings for me as well. 

We meet every day and if by rare situation not, his work (or workout, or day or anything he's doing) is never good because I'm not there, that's what he always say/text me.
If we don't meet for a day he always greets me with strong hug and ""long time no see, I missed you"" 

He buys me food, drink and invite me his home to have it, he do my hair, and I was doing his hair to make it curly. 
Few days ago in the gym I by an accident pour his water that was in the shaker, and I was sorry and he said ""Oh you never be sorry, nor thank me, you can do anything and I wouldn't mind, I will only be angry if you keep saying sorry for things"" and made that ""gay gest"" with his hand and said he could never be angry to me no matter what.

He texts me goodnights everyday or I do. Everywhere he goes, he texts me to go there too. Be it to hangout with his friends or to buy clothes. When he plans on doing something/ going somewhere he always thinks whether I can make it to be there too or not, and if not, he re-organize it. 

Even tho, he was saying multiple times he's into girls only.
But, the thing is, I was born a girl. Now identify as man, looking like a man and living and passing fully. Never considered de-transitioning. But he knows the fact how I was born. And that might be making him to bend his ""straightness"". That is how it looks like to me.

How do you guys see the relation in between what's going on? I might be just overthinking everything. But, hey, this is not how just a friend behaves."

"[MTF] My chest got misshapened to due an injury, I want to fix it, but I don't physically meet the requirements for surgery, and I don't want to out myself to my mom.",Ya_Skinny_Homie,ainbow,"For info, im 17, and only out to 4 people, and live in the U.S.A

Basically, I was running and chest bumping, then someone hit my chest wrong, now the right side of my chest is like a cm to an inch more out than the left side. Without hormones, only bones and crap. There is also constant dull pain.

Now I got this checked out, and two questions that stood out were:


Does it hurt more when I breath?

And

Does it hurt when my heart beats(or something along the lines)


Both answers to these questions are no, so they're going to put me in physical therapy, so the pain stops and I can use my chest properly. The doctor said the surgery hurts a lot worse, for a long time. 

The thing is, I don't want physical therapy, I want a normal chest. I don't care about the pain, or recovery, I just want to have my chest look normal after transition. 


I would mention to the doc ""I want to transition from male to female, so please just give me the surgery, despite the pain"", yet my mom accompanies me to my last doctor's appointments, and she's gonna do the same to my CAT scan in a few days, and I don't have the strength to come out to her yet.


And even now, thinking about it while writing this post, I'm afraid the doctors aren't going to even consider my trans comment, since I haven't had any therapy sessions or anything else. 



I just need advice on how to get a normal looking chest. I would much prefer to get surgery now, then have to wear something or get some sort of cosmetic surgery that just changes the size of one breast."

Are you a bisexual man (or a man who is attracted to men and other genders) who has experienced stigma related to biphobia and masculinity? Click here to learn more about interventions that have the potential to reduce stigma and improve health. Upon completion receive a 5$ amazon gift card!,UMBRESEARCHRACHEL,ainbow,"  

Do you identify as a bisexual man or man who is attracted to men and people of other genders? Do you have a troubling biphobic experience?

The Interventions to Reduce Stigma in Bisexual Men research exercises consist of an initial survey, then three days of online expressive writing or psychoeducation, and a follow up survey the next day and a month later. The research study asks participants to select a personal experience of biphobia that is causing lingering distress and explores healing through psychoeducation and expressive writing prompts. The interventions are at no cost to participants and can be completed at home.  It designed to be accessible for bisexual people who might find it expensive or difficult to locate other affirmative supports. Interventions designed to reduce stigma in bisexual men have the potential to improve health outcomes like depression and reduce negative emotionality related to biphobic events (Levitt et al., forthcoming; Israel et al., 2019; Meyer, 2003). The first 100 participants will receive a $5 amazon gift card upon study completion.

Used to show definite signs of gender dysphoria as a child but not anymore?,gerdie2,ainbow,"Hello guys :)

When I was a kid I was a huge tomboy (I was born in 1998 and this lasted from age 5 to age 12). I guarantee that now a days I would have been labeled as trans. I looked up gender dysphoria in children and I met all the criteria:

A) insist theyre a different gender  for example, they might say Im a girl, not a boy
get upset or angry if theyre called a boy or girl, or brother or sister, or anything else thats gender specific
    - I insisted that I was not a girl and was extremely offended when someone called me a girl
    - I would be extremely upset if my all male friend group treated me any differently 
    - I remember realizing that if I was a boy it meant I had to like girls and asking a girl to be my girlfriend when I was in second grade to her horror (Im now bisexual) 
    - I only played male roles in make believe games 

B) show signs of anxiety like not doing as well as usual at school, having tantrums, or not wanting to take part in usual activities. These signs might be more obvious in settings that are gendered, like school or sports activities
   - my mom made me wear a frilly white blouse for school picture day and I cried and cried and eventually got so upset I chewed a hole in it. I would refuse to wear anything girly and only wore boys clothes
   - I only played sports on boys teams 
   - I would be extremely upset when I had to participate in feminine activities 
   - after my mom learned about transgenders, she actually called me crying and apologizing for how she didnt let me express myself as a child and realized how wrong she was (so cute)

C) go to the toilet in a way thats associated with a different gender  for example, your gender-diverse child who was assigned as female at birth might stand up to urinate 
   - I would actually hate using the womens washroom and would get in trouble for trying to use the boys washroom. I would try to pee by sitting reverse on the toilet. 

D) ask you to call them by a different name and use a different pronoun like he, she or they
ask questions about their gender  for example, Will my vagina turn into a penis? or Can I be a daddy instead of a mummy when I grow up?
     - I would always express that I wish I was a real boy and that I would eventually be one all the time

E) not like the physical signs of their sex or want those that match a different gender  for example, your child might say, Can the doctor take my penis off? or I dont want to grow breasts when I grow up.
    - when I found out about sex reassignment surgery I told my babysitter I was going to get it 


I was disgusted with my body during puberty and would cry constantly about how gross I felt. Eventually I realized that there was no stopping it and conformed to feminine gender norms. I remember wearing makeup and feeling disgusted. But now I LOVE LOVE LOVE being a women and wouldnt change it, Im actually very girly and despite hating jewellery and nail polish I do everything else to maintain a very feminine appearance. However I sometimes do dress up as a man in private, idk if thats weird. Is it possible to be trans as a child and then not anymore?"

Queers are more than patriots: our answer to Martsinkiv!,marimozorrro,ainbow,"*My Ukrainian crush asked me to publish his story in the hope that it would help to fight discrimination against LGBT community in his home country. Right now in Ukraine, LGBT people are being severely persecuted and denied rights, and they are very tedious by our support. Queers who serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and who took part in military actions suffer the most, and in war-thorn Ukraine this has affected many. The military who have come-out suffer from harassment from colleagues and military commanders, become victims of violence in the troops, and their dids are not recognized by the official authorities. I beg you to read this article and share it with your friends. Together we can turn the tide.*

Against the background of another homophobic statements by the mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk Ruslan Martsinkiv, I consider it important to publicly address the Presidential Administration of Ukraine and the Ministry of Veteran Affairs of Ukraine.

It is a shame to realize that while the whole world unites its efforts in the struggle for equal rights, Ukraine still remains in the role of catch-up and admits of severe discrimination of the LGBT community. Another vile attack from the odious representative of the all-Ukrainian union ""Svoboda"" is only the tip of the iceberg of total aggression on the part of nationalists against representatives of non-traditional sexual orientation in Ukraine. It is especially painful that Martsinkiv and his radical brothers do not consider even those of us, who shed blood in Donbass no less than other people. Moreover, it is in the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard that we are much more at risk in case of coming-out. For example, thousands of open homosexuals, under pressure from their own commanders, refused veteran status and payments. Also fresh for us is the example of Vasily Davydenko, who, after a public coming-out last year, became the victim of a severe beating. That is, even active coverage of our problems in the media does not guarantee personal safety.

I believe that the current situation leaves us no other choice but to go beyond the military convoy at KyivPride or local events and to defend our rights as much as possible. This can be done most effectively only be creating our own veteran organization for LGBT people. We will seek to change attitudes towards queer in the army, demand punishment for initiators of homophobic actions, including from nationalist movements or other veteran organizations.  We also insist on the presence of an open LGBT representative in the leadership of the Ministry of Veteran Affairs. Judging by our information, the current government is able to provide us with such an opportunity. But, all the more, we ask the international community to help overcome potential obstacles by creating our own veteran organization, which, according to our calculations, should become one of the largest and most influential in Ukraine, we will not only bring the position of the LGBT community in Ukraine to a new level, but also hope to improve the lives of all veterans in the country with our perseverance. 

With the hope of understanding and support from the leadership of Ukraine and the international community.

So as the title states I'm 23 and gay but I grew up in an extremely religious community in NJ, where my dad is a big rabbi and my mom talks all over on raising good orthodox jewish kids. 

Growing up we were always taught that gay people were wrong, my mom once looked me in the eyes and said gay people are a mistake, and I suppressed that side of me for so long and only came to terms with my sexuality at age 20 and came out to my first friend at 21. This was at a time where I was living on my own and in Manhattan and over these past couple of years (thanks in no small part to amazing friends and drag race) I have grown to be more comfortable with sexuality to a point where if anyone asks me point blank I tell em I'm gay. 

But ever since Covid started I was forced to move back home and to say it's been hell is an understatement. In the community I grew up in, if you aren't married or seriously dating by 21, you are the odd one out. So my parents have been pushing me to go on dates with gals and I've been pushing it off as much as I can but I feel like I'm about to shatter into a million pieces under the wieght of being back in the closet. 

But I have nowhere to really go and once I come out that tarnishes thier reputation and big parts of thier careers that they've built out of having the perfect jewish family and it unintentionally throws all of my younger siblings under the bus as I'm the oldest kid I want to protect em as much as I can.

So if any of y'all have any advice. That would be awesome

Help me understand transsexuality,Ok-Ad858,ainbow,"First off, this is not meant to insult anyone. I am here to learn.
Second, I am not looking for a metaphor to understand dysphoria. I am trying to understand how or why people reach the conclusion that it is their gender/sex that is the problem (again this is not meant as an insult, I just don't know how else to express it).

I see so many posts where people say things like ""I never liked playing with dolls and all my friends are guys, I think I may be trans"". But isn't gender a social construct? What is expected of boys and girls is determined by society. Not wanting to conform to those norms doesn't mean you have to go through surgery and switch gender, right?

Simply put, I do not understand how one reaches the conclusion that one ""doesn't feel like a boy/girl"" and must therefore change their gender. Because what does ""feeling like a boy/girl"" even mean? How does one feel like a boy/girl? What makes someone feel like a boy/girl? We are all just people who happen to have certain genitalia, be they boy, girl, both or neither. Again, this is not meant as an insult. I just really struggle to wrap my head around this.

As a person who has been overweight since childhood, I understand being uncomfortable in your own skin. I also understand wanting to have a concise root of my problems: ""I have the wrong genitalia, therefore I am miserable and I can be happy if I change that one thing"" (In my case, ""I am fat, therefore I am miserable and can be happy if I lose weight.""). 

But I also understand losing weight won't magically solve all my problems. Even if I lost weight, I would still be uncomfortable in my skin, simply because I'm a garbage human being (I will openly admit to that). And I suspect it's the same for transsexuals: Initially, after transitioning, they may feel great, but after a while, all their other psychological issues (depression, anxiety, childhood trauma, etc.) will catch up with them. And they will be miserable again, just in a different body. Now, I'm not saying being transsexuality isn't a thing, because obviously it is, but I think it may not be as common as it would seem.

This is how I understand transsexuality from what I have seen, read and heard online. I am not trying to be insulting and I tried to use the appropriate language as far as I am aware of it. If I am wrong, please correct me. Explain it like you would to a five year old if you have to. I am genuinely trying to learn and understand."

I think I might be transgender but not entirely sure,fafnick8,ainbow,"

Hi there everyone. Im 27 years old. I might possibly be transgender (MTF). Although Im not sure. Also I have aspergers. I have read that a lot people on the autism spectrum are trans as well. I have been feeling this way on and off for two years now. But it all started probably around when I was 20. 

When I met someone in a gay chat room who helped me realized it but then I buried the feelings deep down. Of course around that time it was 2014/2015 thats when I found out about Jazz Jennings and Caitlyn Jenner. The two of them and hearing their stories really made me feel something I hadnt felt before. That my feelings were validated and that it is possible to live as the gender you werent assigned at birth. I finally had a name to put to these feelings and it was transgender. 

My earliest memory of wanting to be a girl was when I was 4 years old. I had seen women ballerinas on tv at the time and also women doing gymnastics on tv also. My mom did sign me up for gymnastics when I was 4 but I didnt too it for to long and I eventually lost interest in it. I one day went to my mom and asked her if she could buy me a tutu and ballet slippers. She said yes and she did. They were costume ones. I remember standing in line at the checkout at the Walmart and I felt like people were starting at us and judging us because I wasnt a little girl and I dont have any sisters. 

I got home and I felt like I was also being judged by my dad as well for wanting to wear them as well. I put them on and I just remember feeling this innocence and bliss in me. This feeling of this is right and feeling amazing. I then wore them around the house and outside for a bit. But while I was out there I saw other people and they saw me. I felt like I was being judged and stared at again. This feeling of guilt, shame, and this feels wrong swept over me. I go back into the house and took off the tutu and ballet slippers I didnt ever wear them again. 

My next memory of wanting to be a girl was when I was 6 years old. Around this time I was really into dressing up in costumes while watching a movie and acting out a certain character in a movie. I did act out male characters. I also acted out female characters as well. 

I acted out Princess Leia in Star Wars Episode 6. Yes even the slave outfit. It was a belt, two towels, my snow boots, and one of my moms bras. Also I acted this workout series called The Firm. I would dress as the women instructors on them. I would wear a plain white t shirt with the sleeves cut off with white briefs. The shirt tucked into the briefs. The women on the videos were wearing leotards. So I made my own leotard. White socks and sneakers. Also even leg warmers. The woman instructor was wearing leg warmers. I made those by cutting the foot part of the sock off. I even had small dumbbells and small ankle weights to go along with it. So I did that for a while eventually lost interest. When doing that I didnt feel guilt or shame. I felt good and I was having fun with it.

When it comes to gender dysphoria Im uncomfortable with having body hair, wishing I had boobs, wishing that I didnt get random erections throughout the day, that my hair was longer. I sometimes feel disgusted when I look at my body. Like why is my body shaped a certain way in areas and why does my body not match what Im sometimes feeling. 

Also clothing. I have seen womens clothing over the years and Im like yes I want to wear this, this, and this. Womens clothing is so much better then mens clothing. A lot more styles and choices to choose from. Plus a lot cuter too. 

I have tried to talk to my mom two years ago  that I might be trans but she didnt entirely understand. That I wasnt trans because I didnt show signs when I was a kid. She gave me an example of one of her friends whose kid was trans and have known it from a younger age. After researching I know thats just something you often see in the media. But its possible to transition at any age. The feelings werent there when I was a kid. I didnt discover them until I was much older. 

I have thought that if I were to ever go forward with it. Would I be willing to lose everything and everyone just to make myself happy? Is my own happiness worth it to lose the people I care about the most. I dont know if I could live like that. Any advice or help sure would be appreciated."
Pronoun help,SwanDive051,ainbow,"Hey everyone, I dont know if this is the right place to ask this or not... apologies if not. I use the pronouns she and her. But, I also am not maam, I am sir. Sir vs maam is not considered a first level pronoun, and so is not specified in the pronoun tags in my workplace (and on LinkedIn).  But, this really bothers me, as people do sometimes use sir and maam in my workplace, especially when dealing with American counterparts. 

Is it bad or offensive in any way if I were to include it in my pronoun list? Ie. she/her/sir?

I'm working on an LGBTQ mentorship program - mentors and mentees wanted!,ducksummers,ainbow,"Hey! A few months back, I started a mentorship program on Reddit [(original post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/g1qrgz/im_starting_a_gay_mentorship_matchmaking_program/).

The idea is that those who are less experienced to the LGBTQ life could use guidance from those who have gone through it. I know times can be tough these days (lol 2020) so I'm hoping this helps.

The initial round of mentorship matching was a big success. I got over one hundred people involved in the program, and feedback has been very strong.

As such, I am expanding the program to the broader LGBTQ community (regardless of gender/sexuality/etc.) and am looking for more mentors and mentees.

**What is it?**

It is an online life mentorship program for the LGBTQ community. I match up those looking for mentorship (mentees) with those willing to be mentors. Mentees and mentors have virtual conversations about whatever interests you: questioning sexual orientation or gender identity, starting relationships, cultivating a career, general chats, anything.

**Im interested in signing up or learning more (either as a mentee or mentor)**

Why is being gay not a mental disorder when it's statistically abnormal? (honestly asking),AdBig6867,ainbow,"I found this comment in an old thread; [https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kamxm/eli5\_why\_are\_paraphilias\_zoophilia\_pedophilia\_etc/cbn0g1s?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kamxm/eli5_why_are_paraphilias_zoophilia_pedophilia_etc/cbn0g1s?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

This user said that some psychiatrists still believe that ""any sort of behavior which is outside the statistical norm should be considered disordered"" including being gay because it's statistically abnormal

They also said;

&gt;In terms of actual measurable psychological/physiological differences etc. however, I don't believe there is actually anything really that different between homosexuality and other sexual fetishes or 'orientations' that are labelled as disordered.

What do you think? Why is being gay not a mental disorder when it's statistically abnormal? And what makes being gay different from paraphilias that are said to be mental disorders?"

Questioning my sexuality for the longest time,fafnick8,ainbow,"
Hi there everyone. Im a 27 year old (m). For the longest time have been struggling with this. I have chatted with men online before. Also looked at gay porn before. I think that Im not gay but I just cant seem to get past this mental block with it. I think I want my significant other to be a woman at some point because I feel emotionally connected to women. 

Men I feel physical attraction towards and it turns me on more then the thought of being with a woman physically. But I wouldnt want a relationship with a guy. Every time after I chat with a guy online or do anything related I feel ashamed and anxious. I dont know why I feel this way but it sucks. 


I have always felt like I have been taken advantage of by these men online because Im on the autism spectrum. Especially this one man who I met online two years ago and he is older. I have been talking to him on and off and gotten to know him. I have played with him sexually on video chat before. But every time after I have I feel tremendous guilt, shame, and anxiety. I keep trying to convince myself that I am gay and I do want a relationship with a man. But deep down I dont think thats what I truly want.


I had to cut that person out of my life because they make me feel like crap every time I have talked to them. Its confusing as shit and it sucks. However when I was dating my ex girlfriend earlier this year. It was like almost my brain flip a switched to questioning and confused with my sexuality to straight. Because all my focus and attention were on her and felt validated in my sexuality while dating her. 


I know there Is nothing wrong with being gay, lesbian bisexual, trans, queer, non binary, asexual, pansexual.
Maybe I am bi or pan I dont know. Its just all really confusing. I feel like if I dont ever have a woman as my significant other weather she is cis, trans, or non binary that I feel like I will be missing out on something really awesome and amazing. 
Of course I dont think porn helps with any of this either. 

Also my religious beliefs play into a lot of this as well. I know that there are LGBTQ+ people who are religious and in loving relationships. But another mental block with it. Im also afraid of what my family and my friends would think as well.

My mom has known that I have chatted with men online before and she says she doesnt want me to.
I made her cry when I was 17 and she first found out that I was talking to men online. 

It seems like most of the gay men I have chatted online with are gross and disgusting. All they want is sex and to see me naked. Which I like an idiot have sent nude pictures to some men before. I was even catfish and scammed out of 330 dollars by a guy online three years ago which sucked. 

Im also a virgin to be honest so Im probably sexually frustrated as well. Im just not going to give my virginity to some random person. I want to lose it to my significant other so it will be special for me. Also it is really common among people on the autism spectrum to be a virgin. 

I have talked to my therapist before about most of this as well. They have been helpful and I have told them most of what I just said in this post.

My brother I have talked to him before about this and he wouldnt care if I were gay or bi. I just could really use some advice or help on all this. I sure will appreciate it."

Any coming out tips or advice to fully love and accept myself?,Hyphen1-2,ainbow,"I want to come out as gay so bad, but I have no idea anymore. I keep making excuses and blaming other things but maybe its just because I havent fully accepted myself. Im a 16 year old Hispanic male that attends a small private Catholic high school and have Catholic Hispanic parents. My parents have never been quite obvious about their stance on homosexuality, but I dont know if its good or bad. They have never said anything bad about it, but not anything good either. We usually watch a show called modern family together and they never fast forward the gay couple, but they would say that seeing the gay couple from Schitts Creek awkward. I will admit that Schitts Creek was more sexual humor so i dont know if that makes a difference. They also have told me I need to make more guy friends and ask me why I do so much facial expressions and hand gestures (which is often seen as a gay stereotype.) But Im confused because they constantly tell me how much they love me and that theyll miss me so much when I leave for college and my own dad says he has a special connection with me than he does with his other children. So why would he disown me? I mean, the biggest thing in my life that has shown that Im not like most other boys is that when the movie Frozen came out, I was OBSESSED with it. I played it repeatedly and sang literally every song every minute of the day and my parents never said it was girly or to stop, heck my dad told me to keep singing them. So Im honestly just confused but I just want to come out because I know Im gay, I just dont know whats holding me back and Im wondering if its because I havent fully accepted who I am and if Im not completely ready, even though I really want to come out, or because Im scared of my parents reactions. I know 100% my older siblings (24F, 21M, 19M) will support me and my friends. Its just my parents Im worried about because I love them and dont want to hurt them. Theyve already been through a lot. If anyone has any advice or suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

In my area there are three main groups:

Group A is mostly parents of LGBT children/adult children, with a scattering of LGBT individuals. No matter how many people, new or not, we're in the room, the same 3-5 people dominated the conversation and it was a struggle for anyone else to speak and be heard. 

Group B is ""popular"" (big presence at PRIDE and other events)  but badly organized. I volunteered with them at several events and each one was a disaster due to the organizer or board members either being late or never showing up at all. When I attended their meetings multiple members had boundary issues and were obnoxious. 

 Group C is one giant clique. 

I volunteer and march at every PRIDE parade that isn't occurring during a plague, plus several events throughout the year, but never seem to meet anyone I click with. I also don't/can't drink and most LGBT people I know practically live at bars/clubs during normal times."

Heya,the-china-the-china,ainbow,"So basically if you seen my posts, you probably know that Im bisexual, that Im really young(10 to be exact), and that Im also attracted to anime characters, but heres the problem and why Im posting this, (this is going to be a really big post so continue reading if you still want) well lets start with the news to my last post, basically my parents came into my room and saw the drawing on my wall, and they read the text, but the thing that break me in that moment was that after they reading it they actually got really upset over me, they said that I was too young to say those things, but in my opinion, sexuality doesnt have nothing to do with age, responsibility, or maturity, you can say your sexuality when you at least know that its yourself, and it can happen in any moment of your life, after they said that they ordered me to erase it all from my wall, they said they didnt wanted to my grandma to know about that, and I dont think that I will look to them normally now because this actually really hurts me, and I think that even if I was a teenager, they would also say the same thing, which really bothers me, next we have a problem that happen to me today and is happening right now,(please dont make fun of me because of this because Im not lying, I swear, this is actually happening)basically when I said I was attracted to anime characters, its because its not just attraction, in some cases of mine Ive seen that it was actually literal obsession, and most of them are boys, and so I treated them like if they were real, but since I know they arent, it made me think of people who I have attraction to, but in real life, and this just popped to my head: what REAL boys did I had attraction to? And after a little while of thinking, Ive seen that, for real people, Ive NEVER in my whole life was attracted to real boys, only anime boys, and the only real person that I actually REALLY like, is a girl, (I blame the attraction to anime people on my parents because they that made me like anime, since I was already involved with it since I was born) And now I am struggling on choosing my sexuality, I believed that I was bi because of the anime boys but, looking know I think that Im actually lesbian and just lied to my self that I was bi, but Im believe that I was actually lesbian my whole life and just didnt notice it, but heres the worst problem at all of them, they are already mad and were not accepting that I was only bi, imagine if I came out to them as a LESBIAN IN THIS AGE KNOWING HOW THEY REACT TO YOUNGER PEOPLE COMING OUT, IF I TELL THEM ALL INCLUDING MY GRANDMOTHER IM DEAD, I know they cant kick me out because they would be out of the laws of my contry, but still I have a feeling that they are going to threat me really badly, and my grandparents are probably going to just hate me for the rest of my life, Im afraid that when the school come back, I start dating because I had the plan only date girls, my whole sexual and romantic life was going a eternal secret until I adult age, and that is going to take a hell of a time, and I also dont want to get my partner in danger or trouble either, and I dont want to date people of gender attracted to, I think that if I try to come out to them now third time the rest of my life is going to a eternal HELL, I know that with my friends its all ok to be lesbian or bisexual, but with my parents Im actually terrified, please, I need help with this, I dont know if my life is going to be the same ever again, because I know that they are going to find out one time that I wont be able to hide it from my family, Im going to try to contact my friends to ask them for some help because Im really oppressed with that right now that Im writing this post, I even did a doodle in my sketchbook today of my self asking my own sexuality to see if that I would calm down my brain, but know every time I look to that drawing I get even more worried, and also I know its really random know but, if you were going to say for me to go visit therapy to see if calm it down, Im sorry but I cannot adapt to therapy, I really just dont feel comfortable with it and I prefer to talk to my friends that I believe my soul in, but other than that after all Im just afraid, uncomfortable, confused and oppressed, so if you are able to help me with this, please just say it because I really need help in this, or else theres high chances that the rest of my life is going to be a eternal hell"

Nail in the coffin was gender studies prof because I have literally never met, seen, or HEARD of this person beforehand, but I feel safe enough to say. It feels weird and gross to just say my assigned pronouns because theres so much more going on in my head right now. (But because I suck, even in a safe space I dont know what pronouns I want...)

Im questioning, and I dont think Ive ever talked through my confusion - and thats really what this reddit account is for - so it at least FEELS like a big secret. Im aware that not everyone in my life needs to know for you to be out. Some people just wont know things about you.

Problem is my education on all different orientations is minimal, I want to be able to understand everyone a little better in order to help, Surport or just talk to others.

I've two questions I want to ask and I hope they're not offensive.

What's the difference between Bi and Pan? 
I've heard different answers and just want to understand better.

What is Asexual?
As far as I understand from reading posts on it, it's no sexual preference or attraction.
This is Somthing I struggle to understand and just want someone who knows better to educate me so I'm less ignorant on the topic.

so I'm planning to move to college/uni in the UK in about two weeks, but I'm becoming extremely worried if I'll be able to be myself there, in regards to my sexuality.

The university I'll be going to has about 15k students in total; it's located in a city of about 100k people. Now, this might sound like a dumb question, but is that 'enough' for a decent chance in dating &amp; exploring my sexuality?

Right now, I live with my parents in a not very accepting city and I'm stressed that life won't be very different when I move due to the small city and number of students there and, frankly, that's one of the most important things to me right now, having lived in the closet for a number of years. Plus, I'm kinda spending a lot of money going studying abroad and I want to have a good experience overall.

Thank you to everyone for advice, I'm just so confused with myself, insecure and scared it's unbelievable"

It was just a terrible week for them, so, we set out to try and have a fun night. We played dress up and had a great time together. Then I accidentally misgendered them TWICE but did correct myself right afterward. I said, ""she, I mean they.""  Fucked right? I know its better to catch yourself right away, but I just feel like such a dumbass because the thing is in my head, I see them as they/them. As who they are.

"I(18f) asked my boyfriend(20m) out to hide my sexuality. Dating for 3 years, he still doesn't know",throwaway565589,ainbow,"*posted this in* r/relationships, *but after being advised by mod, posting here*

I (18f) am bisexual/pansexual and i do love my boyfriend Y(20m) very much. I am not playing or living a life of a lie , i genuinely love him romantically.

I live in a homophobic country. even though things are improving ever since lgbt rights have been passed, but society is a long way from being accepting and tolerant. I knew i wasn't straight from around age 13 , or maybe earlier. Closet was the only option for me, i was terrified to tell my friends and even more terrified to tell my family.

then when i was 15 , this incident happened at a local school. a little less than a dozen girls were rusticated from the school because they were doubted to be lesbians. I was petrified because even as a joke, a few ppl in my school had this idea that i wasn't straight. And a few whom i told myself. I had to anything and everything in my power to prove that i was straight.

This is where Y comes. I knew Y for almost 3 years or so before this. I knew that he kind of liked me. And I thought this was my chance. If i can show everybody that i have a boyfriend they wouldn't think any further. these ppl that i was proving my sexuality to were like aloof from the entire lgbt thing. they know homosexuality and queerness exist but don't know any variations whatsoever. It would be easy to fool them.

Thus , i asked Y out, and he gladly agreed. i told him i liked him for a long time and other bullshit like that. I thought of breaking up with him after the entire homophobia uproar calms down. I went around telling ppl i got a boyfriend, our relationship became pretty known and everyone forgot about my ""queerness"". even a friend asked me about me being a lesbian and why im dating a guy, and i laughed it off saying it was a joke. Slowly everything became ""normal"".

But this is also where things went downhill from my plan. My relationship with Y started going too good. to a point i shared everything about myself to him (except my sexuality of course) , even i considered telling him about sexuality since he was one of the most accepting and tolerant ppl I've ever met. After a point i realized i was indeed in love with him. still am, deeply as ever.

5 months after we started dating, our state and then our country legalized same sex relationship and lgbtq rights. And suddenly everyone i knew became a thousand times more accepting and free. it was like a dream come true.

Right from then till now, im stuck in this limbo of guilt. Y is proud of me and our relationship and our love. he every now and then mentions how he knew that i liked him back and was just embarrassed to admit. he loves me more than i love him. but to him its like i love him way more than anyone can ever love anyone. I want to take this secret to grave. i have zero intentions of breaking up with him. i see a lovely future with him. But if i ever tell him this, his entire believe and trust in me and this relationship would shatter down. No hes not homophobic, but that he was nothing but a scapegoat for me would break his heart.

but the constant guilt of lying to him is killing me. I know it was disgusting of me to use his innocence and love for me and then planning of dumping him right away. But i had no option, if the word, that i'm queer got out, my life my career, my family's name everything would have been shattered. i could be knifed or raped (to ""fix"" me). Everyday i see him smiling happily , my soul fills with shame and guilt , i can't keep this inside me forever, and the very day i tell him, it'll result in a break up.

&amp;#x200B;

 i have already planned of telling him im bi, already given some hints and he doesn't mind.

What should i do, is there anything that actually could be done? Just came here to put this off of my shoulders. How do i tell him i used him without breaking him down?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR! : Dated boyfriend to prove im straight when im not and decided to dump him right after, fell in love now guilt is killing me"

Is there scientific validity to being non-binary?,petricorblossom,ainbow,"I usually don't put trigger warnings because I think they're dumb, but I don't want someone who is easily offended to read this post and respond in an angry and outraged rhetoric. Therefore, here is your...

**!! TRIGGER WARNING !!**

Anyways, I'll start.

Hi, I want to start this out by saying I'm not looking for a debate, but rather mere discussion. I was originally going to post this on a throwaway account in r/lgbt or r/NonBinary, but I figured both of those subreddits wouldn't be very fitting for something of this sensitivity and I'm feeling fairly brave about this topic. Especially since this subreddit supposedly has looser moderation.

While I don't think my opinion can be swayed, I do want to hear someone address my points and reasoning directly to either cause me to question or solidify my stance. Please keep the responses mature and appropriate. I will read every response thoroughly, and reply to the ones I feel I should engage with. Now, onto my stance.

**I don't think non-binary is valid**. There, I said it. Actually, I don't believe in the notion that there is genders beyond the binary of male and female as a whole. You might think I'm a bad person for saying this, but I usually wouldn't care about what people want to identify as. They could identify as a McDonald's #2 Combo Meal complete with a Diet Coke and it usually wouldn't bother me. However, I've been seeing a surprising amount of stereotypical *""enbies""* that are far-leftist marxists get upset and outraged at people for both denying the existence of non-binary as a gender and/or misgendering them accidentally. I've gotten into several discussions about this on various social medias and have come to the conclusion that perhaps... *non-binary doesn't exist at all*. These discussions have opened my eyes on not only how silly the idea is, but how *dangerous* it can be from a social standpoint. Let me explain:

Firstly, I want to talk about how the term ""non-binary"" was coined originally. As you may know, it was actually encapsulated by the word known as ""genderqueer"" today in the mid-1990s. It became popularized by far-left political activists and has morphed and changed into several identities that we define as of now. The idea behind it was that it would be an identity for anybody that feels they are gender-nonconforming. Obviously, later the term ""non-binary"" was created and spread inside specifically and most notably gender studies classes, but that's irrelevant.

The reason why I feel that the idea of a gender for ""gender-nonconforming"" people is fictional is because the idea of gender-nonconforming is founded upon gender roles, a socially-constructed idea. Gender identity and gender roles do not correlate whatsoever in a biological or neurological sense. Because a girl likes to play with army men and a boy likes to play with barbies doesn't mean they're no longer a girl or a boy, right? Saying that a girl doesn't like pink so she is now gender-nonconforming only reinforces the ideal that *all girls do like pink,* which is harmful as it therefore enforces the idea of gender roles. In actuality, nobody is a perfect clone of society's definition of 100% masculine or 100% feminine. So what defines being non-binary? A feeling? That doesn't seem very logical. So then, what defines what is a *""real""* gender and what is not? What are the limits? Is it all based on feelings?

For example, [there are 300 genders according to this blog on Tumblr](https://www.theapricity.com/forum/showthread.php?191479-Complete-List-of-Tumblr-Genders-(SO-FAR)). Are all 300 of those genders valid? Why not? How is non-binary more valid than the other 299? Denying science and creating genders upon the idea that it's a social construct affects so many aspects of our daily lives that I would be unable to write out the entire list if I tried (and a lot of the genders literally just boil down to being a personality trait).

Some common points people make are that:

1. *Intersex PROVES that there are more than 2 genders.*
2. *Gender dysphoria for transsexuals proves that your gender doesn't correlate to your sex.*

I disagree quite a bit with these. Firstly, you're right. There is such a thing as intersex. It's a biological phenomenon. However, people who identify as non-binary have no biological basis and are not intersex. It's merely a gender identity, unlike intersex. So how does something biological and *gender identity that has no biological basis* *whatsoever* compare?

Secondly, I could go into transgenderism all day and talk about how transsexuals have practically been proven to be undeniably valid with historical, neurological, and biological bases, but I'll save you the time and say that there is [a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MitqjSYtwrQ)*.* In fact, if anything, intersex proves the existence of transsexuals over all of the other 300+ genders. On the other hand, non-binary activists claim that you do not need gender dysphoria to be gender-nonconforming, and there is 0 evidence of gender dysphoria being a valid reason for identifying as non-binary. Even a lot of enbies I have encountered in life often go by two sets of pronouns, often being either he/they or she/they. Going by two sets of pronouns kinda invalidates the whole premise of being non-binary, don't ya think?

I'd be interested in any valid counter-arguments against these, and am open to listening to other opinions. Thank you."

Lonely and confused,Nalaniel,ainbow,"Hello. I am a young transgender woman (22; on HRT for couple of months). Long story short, I have generally been very lonely throughout my life. I come from a conservative part of Croatia, although I have lived my earliest years and last couple of years in Germany. All my genuine friendships and relationships were online ones. They were also with either cis males or trans people. Importantly, I also seem to be cursed with an extremely strong desire to give and receive love and affection, even in my friendships. I have a wonderful (trans) girlfriend, but I pushed away all of the other people I talk to recently because I couldn't be happy in regard to my needs I mentioned above, after I spent a long time with them. Unfortunately, it seems that even with an amazing significant other, I still feel lonely. So I have a few questions.

1) How come we see so much less of lonely females online compared to males? Sure, it's to avoid harassment by said males, but I struggle to find it talked about at all, online, other than female incels who are extreme cases. Do females just stick to themselves on social networks given they generally form friendships easier, to the extent it explains the huge disparity between men and women complaining about this issue online?

2) Pertaining to my trans status (Im still transitioning and don't pass yet), how much more likely are cis girls to be uncomfortable around me as opposed to another cis girl? Obviously amongst male friends, particularly where I come from, being lovey-dovey and gentle is seen as weird at best, but I am not sure in regards to girls."

But these memes I keep seeing about how pedophiles are trying to join the LGBTQ community and how we're standing against that... What? I'm sorry, but where is this happening? I've seen the memes, and I've seen alt right people referencing those memes to attack us, but that's it.

This is the problem. Alt right trolls pretended to be pedophiles trying to join the community to give power to their claim that there's a link between LGBTQ people and pedophilia. And then, when people took them seriously and started this whole thing about posting memes saying we'd never let them in it just gave them more power.

Ignore them. Of fucking course pedophiles don't belong in LGBTQ communities. But any time you're forced to say that, it gives them the power to be able to say, sure this persons against it, but this proves it's happening and some people are probably for it.

Fuck pedophiles. Fuck homophobes. Fuck transphobes. Queer liberation will come not when we convince them we're not evil, but when we emancipate ourselves from the standards they impose."

The Update!!,LlamaUtopian,ainbow,"(Ive posted this elsewhere but could use more feedback)


TLDR: the update to my situation with my best friend - went from uncertainty a month ago to kissing + his hand down my boxers. Now hes distant with me


So I finally told my best friend how I felt about him this past Saturday. We were cuddling and there was clear...contact from him. So I rolled over and started kissing him. He got very excited and put his hand down my boxers and eventually pulled them down but after about a minute or two he stopped and went downstairs. 

In the kitchen he kept dodging what just happened and kept saying yeah but Im not gay but this was a clear denial of the situation, and our past - like the label of sexuality scares him more than being with me.

He didnt cuddle me again throughout the night but I knew he wanted to be close to me but kept pulling himself back. I could also see that he was still clearly aroused.

I sent him a message on snapchat the morning after telling how I feel again and how nothing needs to change but his response was pretty dismissive. He wont acknowledge any of this still. But I know he feels the same on some level"
Stealthing,EndStealthing,ainbow,"Stealthing refers to the removal or damaging of a condom during sex, without a partner's consent and often knowledge. Stealthing is sexual assault. Stealthing violates conditional consent and can open victims up to the risk of STIs and unwanted pregnancies, as well as feeling extremely violating and isolating as the issue is often laughed off as 'not a big deal'. 

I am in the process of setting up a campaign to raise awareness of stealthing, and potentially conduct a review of the law in England and Wales. 

If any of you, of any gender, have had experience with stealthing and feel comfortable sharing your experience on here, you could be helping others recognise their assault!"

The friend who sent me the messages isnt known for causing drama and has helped people out a lot before so I dont think he Ben has ulterior motives, especially considering the ensuing conversation.

I was freaking the fuck out, saying I cant believe I lost the only good thing I had going for me and how I fucking hate my body.

Ben told me I didnt lose the only thing I had going for me, and I didnt lose much at all, and if I think my body is the only thing I have going for me Im mistaken as to how much I actually have going for me.

He also told me that if I only love my body because people want to fuck it, I dont actually love my body for what it is, and getting validation from getting fucked isnt the same as self-love (he told me that he noticed a pattern of me doing that in the past).

Im really not sure what to do from here. I feel so ducking hurt and ugly, but Im not about to post pics or anything because I know that if I ask you if Im ugly thats just further looking for validation, and wouldnt help my mindset in the slightest.

But yeah, it was two people, with a third not making insults but laughing along. Ben told me he doesnt associate with them much and he was added to the group chat against his will months ago, but felt rude if he left it so he just ignores it. I believe him.

What exactly do I do from here?"

How can I deal with my mom who's homophobic and snooped my phone and saw flirting between me (m/19) and a guy (m/22),FriendlyWorldliness1,ainbow,"Even though I'm not in a relationship, I feel like I'm in a LDR. To start, I'm closeted gay (M/19) and from Canada. I like this guy (M/22) whose country I'm not going to name but my mom is from the same country. This is my second account as my guy has Reddit as well.

We been talking for 3 + months now and I know he has stronger feelings then I have for him but it's the most I felt for anyone. Its my first time experiencing this stuff as I'm only 19. I can't stop thinking of him. For some reason, I started yearning to meet him irl. I feel like I'm on a roller coaster as my feelings are up and down. Btw, I should point out that we video chat many times and were pass the point of trust issues.

I know he would be hurt if I dated someone else, but he would still respect my decisions but he said it would be very hard to move on. I would feel the same for him as well if he dated someone else. But believe it or not, he's the most happiest thing that ever happen to me which sounds like crazy talk to me. I really think of him a lot and he cares for me. I know my feelings aren't strong as his feelings are for me, but I my never meet anyone else as him. I'm a suicidal person and I don't expect a lot from the future, but ever since we started chatting I started seeing myself with goals and talking to him sometimes gives me motivation for something great in life. I already got attached to him.

If I met someone nearby (\*Hypothetically), I'm not sure if it will work out. Thats because I wouldn't get to see the person often. Who want their partner visit them every once or twice a month. Even to leave my house is hard because its a bit of a struggle/stigma to convince my parents to go out even to meet my friend. (Before the pandemic)

One time we got into a fight, he told me ""I love you and I'm willing to be that one idiot who will be a martyr for you"". The reason why we got into a fight in the first place was because I kept asking whether he'll find someone that will make him happier then I do. Which I can agree is my fault. I'm just trying to figure things out. I tried to imagine my life without him and I didn't like it. He even told me he carved my name on a tree. I mean, I keep having the feeling that if I leave him, it wouldn't be the same. I may feel wrong to date someone else. I would feel jealous if he met someone else. He even texted my best friend that he loves me. He told me, he would be respectful with my decision if I left him but he'll be very hurt though.

Since were not officially in a relationship, I checked tinder just outta curiosity but it felt weird looking at other guys. I mean there were good looking guys but it didn't really affect me. Today he told me his cat died and he was really sad so I tried to comfort him. I never had any pets, but the moment he told me that, I shredded a few tears. I feel if I get him out of my life, I might be making a mistake. I just don't know where this is going. Even if I were to date someone near me I wouldn't know where its going. Am I in love with him. I know its sorta possible we can meet, so if that time comes, I'll be happy. This is the first time someone told me that they love me.

At this point, I should say my parents are homophobic. My mom snooped through my phone saw our messages, the ""sweet talk"" and heart emojis and she freaked out. I told her it's part of a joke. She said that I'm too young for that and I shouldn't get too close with people and she said some homophobic stuff. I don't have a lock on my phone (that's a long story) unfortunately, so I'm just hiding the app me and my guy communicating on. As my guy is aware of the situation, we're keeping things on a crush level for now and were just enjoying each other's online company.

BTW, I cant date local because of the pandemic and my parents wont let me go out to visit friends much."
Taboo,SuperMaxi2161,ainbow," I (14m bi) recently came out to my mom and she was supportive but no-one said the words bi or bisexual (I used a letter and she came into my room later to talk and hug) after we talked it wasn't like a weight was lifted off my shoulders like it was when I came out to my friend. It was more awkward. I wasn't so anxious about coming out anymore but I felt like I had to hide in other ways and remove some of my subtle displays of pride e.g. computer backgrounds.

I shave my legs and my mom gave me a razor for it, but when she did she closed the door and spoke in hushed tones. I feel like there is some taboo surrounding these things It's uncomfortable. I don't like it. In my logical mind, I know it makes no sense, but it is very tangible.

Is this internalized homophobia?"

Whats the best terminology to describe my gender identity?,M0SSpunk,ainbow," Im AFAB, and Ive identified as a nonbinary lesbian for a couple years. The thing is Im not sure if nonbinary is exactly how I want to describe myself. I dont have strong dysphoria, but Ive never really felt like I wanted to be physically female. I hate periods and anything involving pregnancy or the female reproductive system freaks me out. Like, I actually think that the female reproductive system is kinda cool, but thinking about it in my body feels weird. I also have some slight dysphoria around my chest, I usually wear tight sports bras and have thought about getting a breast reduction, though I also find that I like showing off my boobies around other women and I dont think Id ever want to fully get rid of them. 

My presentation is also complicated. Ive always been tomboy-ish, and masculine clothing has always felt the most natural. I also use a more androgynous/slightly masculine nickname, I dont shave, and I use some masculine terms for myself (I really like soft boy lol). However I also love feminine fashion, just acting more feminine in general, and sometimes classify myself as a femme. The difference is masculine presentation feels like a more accurate portrayal of who I am, whereas feminine presentation feels more like an intentional performance. 

To sum things up: I am AFAB, I identify as a lesbian and feel that lesbianism is the only thing truly tying me to womanhood, I feel slight dysphoria and masculine presentation feels most natural to me, but I also describe myself as femme and tend to intentionally present more feminine because I find engaging in voluntary playful femininity to be fun and somewhat empowering. 

Im fine with using the term nonbinary lesbian most of the time, but I also want a more specific term to provide more detail when necessary. I guess mostly what I wanna convey with this is femme-ish lesbianism mixed with soft masculinity. 

Some things Ive considered are:

\- Lesbian soft boy (I used this one once and had someone got mad at me abt it ;-;)

\- Femme boy (I think the wordplay is rlly fun, but I dont like the sexual connotations)

\- Transmasc femme

\- Femme demiboy

Any other ideas? :)"

Sex Work,Texas_sucks15,ainbow,"To start this off, I am in no way trying to bash sex workers. What you do for your source of income is your business and support it.

But when it comes to this pandemic, it gets sloppy. 

It seems like the pandemic doesnt yield safety measures when it comes to this profession. Workers on OnlyFans and just normal people uploading on sites such as pornhub are personally alarming to me because they fail to realize that their interactions still puts others, outside of that video, at risk

It seems like this is common sense, but I get pushback from the community, and I believe its more so of selfishness and insecurity as opposed to the logical standpoint at hand. 

I understand that some people utilize sex work as their only source of income. Its what they need to get through the pandemic, but if youre going to categorize it as essential work then treat it as a such - do testing before shoots, wear and keep face masks on the entire time, and of course use condoms. But you dont see that for the most part. Its business as normal.

Will using these safety measures take enjoyment out of the experience? Yes. But its no different from other precautions essentials workers from other professions  have to experience. Were all doing this to decrease the spread of COVID and I feel as if sex workers believe theyre exempt from the realities but dont want to vocalize it, and rather, attack the person trying to present common sense."

Petty and hopefully funny coming out ideas,Horror-Sport,ainbow,"Hello fellow amazing individuals!

I have recently moved out, and my parents are homophobes and transphobes of the ""dont ask dont tell because it is fucking weird"" kind, so while I dont face every day harrasment from them I cant be open freely at home. They are also kind of bad parents due to their own insecurities but that is another discussion.

Now since I am a self imposed court jester I need the dumbest and pettiest ideas for coming out, the more offended they  the better because if they disowned me it would just make the process alot simpler honestly, I do not care alot for them.

My ideas so far are just covering their home in rainbow flags so they have to touch the icky gay stuff when they remove it and tell them that I will not put my foot inside of their home untill they realize how weird they are. Also some articles about queer issues, being transgender and all that jazz in hope they arent too illiterate. But that isnt too funny and I need some more ideas, anyone has something?

If it helps with ideas so can I mention that I am asexual homoromantic.

Thanks yall, have a good day, you're all so valid I will fight anyone who says otherwise."

I need thoughts,CCSploojy,ainbow,"Hi there!

This is going to be **loooong** so **tl;dr** is a coworker has been acting very weird after I confessed I had some feelings for him and thought he felt the same way so I decided to drop him from my life but then he started trying to reconnect in his last day(s).

**Story:**

I'll try to keep this as brief as I can; I'll preface it by stating that I am a 28y/o gay man (turned 28 a couple days ago). I am typically very obtuse/oblivious to people showing interest in me and usually reject it even if it is there because I have been hurt by close friends, lovers, and my own family. I also have low confidence despite being objectively attractive. The point of this post is to just gather thoughts and ideas. I am deep in the sciences and believe the more options/ideas you have, the better informed you will be in choosing the best option/idea for yourself.

I work in a clinical lab and am currently experiencing some friction with a colleague. He is a younger (21y/o) straight man. We grew close and basically became friends but I started to sense that he might have felt more. I didn't want to entertain the idea at first but it got to the point where I felt we were basically going on dates so I explored it. I explored it because I'm used to shutting out my options in fear of rejection but told myself that if I want to find that person, I need to give possible opportunities around me a chance to bloom (I haven't dated at all in the past 3 years). I also knew he was leaving soon (leaves tomorrow) so that if worst came to worst, I wouldn't have to deal with it in the near-future. Lastly, I was extremely confident he had feelings for me.

I opened up to him over text and made sure to make it absolutely clear that there was no pressure and that I would be open to sweeping everything under the rug if that was preferred and going back to how things were. He seemed very receptive and understanding, but made it clear that he was straight and didn't feel the same way. Everything worked out well from my perspective. Sure it hurt that he didn't reciprocate, but I was happy he was able to be mature about it and still wanted to be friends.

Or so I thought.

The next day and every ensuing day, he ignored me. Literally. I tried having normal conversation but he would pretend he didn't hear me or say something under his breath that was inaudible to me. Even mocked me for stuttering once, again under his breath. I was actually proud of myself because I did a great job of respecting him and treating him like I normally did: as a friend; very platonic. And I want to emphasize that I am not the attached type or the overly affectionate type (a mix of avoidant-dismissive and fearful; I'm also actually a really masculine guy and I make this point because I understand a lot of straight guys are uncomfortable with male femininity). 

Anyway, I had to literally yell his name to get his attention when he made mistakes (mind you I work in a BSL-2 lab so communication is absolutely essential). So I found it completely unprofessional and I was personally offended as well. Conversations with colleagues also changed for the worst. As soon as I joined a conversation I noticed he would leave it immediately. I didn't understand how my colleagues did not notice because it was such a drastic change in group dynamic and his behaviour but I had noticed another colleague giving very subtle, non-verbal cues to him so I immediately caught onto the fact that he had told her what happened (and I was fucking right about that). I had to ask her if she noticed him being distant/ignoring me and she told me he told her what happened. The weird thing is she told me that he said he still wanted to be friends and wanted to go back to how things were. Also that he wished I had spoken to him about it in person. This confused me because that is exactly what I told him when he rejected me. That I completely understood and said we can just go back to normal and pretend it never happened.

After ignoring me I just decided maybe he needs space because it was still weird to him so I did give him space and let him be. I was still cordial as I could be and if there were group conversations I acted like I usually do and actually felt great because I was able to bounce back so easily.

But then he started doing weird things that seemed pretty deliberate and hurtful, aside from still ignoring me. Like avoiding sitting near me on breaks (we sat together literally every break before this) and bringing gifts/food for our small group of colleagues/friends but purposely not giving me any. One day he even asked me to help him with some drinks -- after not having spoken to me in a week -- to which I did, and when we got to our break room he offered them all a drink except me. Now that is what really hurt me because I was nice enough to help and I felt taken advantage of. So then I decided to drop him because I don't need that negativity in my life.

This is where I need thoughts or maybe even help. I talked to my friends about this because they are amazing and also because three of them are professional psychologists/psychiatrists (succinctly, one is developmental, one is behavioural, and one is social) and they were all very supportive of my decisions and reactions. My friends see me as a very practical, logical person that doesn't usually respond emotionally. Which is true, but I figured they may be biased so I want an outside perspective. They basically think it is internalized homophobia and that he is gaslighting me. They support whatever decision I make because they think I'll make the responsible decision and that there is no right answer. I completely agree, but again, the more ideas the better.

Today he started trying to talk to me again, which I honestly was expecting. I knew it was going to happen but thought he would wait until the last day. I was hurt, so I told myself that if he tried to reconnect, I would not reciprocate because it was unfair to myself. I feel I have a wealth of friends in my life that love and support me. I have a family that -- although treated me terribly throughout my childhood -- has turned around to support me and accept me into the family regardless of my orientation. So I feel I am content and don't need this person in my life. I won't be losing out. He will because he has a hard time making friends but I am the opposite; I make friends very easily. But part of me feels that if he is trying now (which I imagine tomorrow he will try to reconnect again), I should give him a chance. He is an adult, but I'm sure he has never been put into this situation before. But that is also why I was so delicate in telling him that it was ok if he didn't feel the same way. Not to mention telling him in the first place (I was confident he was open-minded enough to handle it with tact/maturity).

Tomorrow is his last day and I am certain he is going to try to talk to me again. It feels surreal because I have predicted quite a bit about this situation and ended up being correct so I feel I **know** he will try to me tomorrow. **Is it unreasonable for me to reject him and any advance or reconciliation he tries to make?** I'm partly worried because he is connected to me and our colleagues who like us both very much and I don't want to cause a rift in the group but I felt like he wasn't treating me as a human being with feelings. I also genuinely feel he has lied in some way. Either to me or our mutual friend/colleague in saying he wants to be friends so I feel very distrusting now. I don't know what it is but my bullshit detector has been ringing since she told me he said that.

What are your thoughts? Am I being reasonable or unreasonable? Is it worth the time/energy? Sorry for the essay."

Sick of homophobia under the guise of wokeness,clipofmescreaming,ainbow,"I am a very left leaning person and I hate the title of this post because it sounds all terfy. Trans rights are human rights. I've  just noticed that especially on twitter there has been quite a bit of homophobia that is played of as being more inclusive. I saw a post about how white gay men have a habit of using AAVE and that it needs to change, this i completely agree with, i have no problems with this, but in the comments I saw a bunch of people just being blatantly homophobic, like a comment that said 'white gays using AAVE really triggers my homophobia' it got a bunch of likes and everything and it made me sick. I feel like I'm not allowed to have a problem with the post because it has a valid criticism at it base. I also see a bunch of people who say gay men are the straight men of the lgbt community, which I just hate, its so invalidating, I wish everyday I was straight, i struggle with external and internal homophobia constantly. I understand that some gay men can be transphobic or biphobic, and i hate that, i wish it wasn't the case, but its not an excuse to be blatantly homophobic. That's what it is, using a select few problematic gay men and saying that all gay men are like that and are the straights of the lgbt community is homophobia. I know this is a petty issue, but when this kind of stuff comes from the people you are supposed to be safe around, it hits much harder. I understand that gay men can be exclusionary and gross, but they don't represent me, I feel like I have to fight the same battles I do with right wing bigots. I'm sorry for the rant, please don't hate me for rhis, if you think im wrong, please let me know, im still in the closet and don't have anyone to talk to about this kind of stuff, so it just goes round in my head and I needed to get it out."

I was a terf in highschool and I cant get past it,M0SSpunk,ainbow," So basically, when I was in highschool (I think about age 15) my mom got really into terf ideology. I wasnt all that knowledgeable about LGBT topics or social justice, so I didnt even know what a terf was at first. Eventually I ended up getting super terfy, even making a radfem tumblr blog. 

When I went away to college I met a lot of trans people and realized how shitty my beliefs had been. I also came out as a lesbian and began to realize that I was nonbinary as well. I was really depressed freshman year, due partially to how guilty I felt.

Like, before I left I was filling out the housing options and one said gender inclusive, and my mom was like oh, you dont wanna end up living with a trans woman, and I just went along with it. But then later on I made a lot of friends from gender inclusive housing and really wished Id chosen it. 

When I got home that summer stuff had completely changed. My mom identified as nonbinary and didnt even talk about having been a terf, then at family dinners she would constantly make comments about me being a terf and kept trying to goad me into an argument. When she found out I was nonbinary she got really mad that Id never told her and kicked me out. I stayed with my grandma the rest of the summer, even though after a point she went back on it and said I was allowed back home. 

Nowadays Ive been stuck at home bc of COVID and stuffs been weird. I can never feel comfortable at all around my mom. I go by a different name now, but for some reason if my mom uses it stresses me out, like I dont feel like she has the right or Im scared something will snap and shell go back to terf mode. Shes always trying to talk about gender stuff with me but for some reason it just makes me so uncomfortable and I freeze up and then she gets mad and yells at me for ignoring her or accuses me of still being a terf. 

Stuffs also been tense with my siblings. Im the oldest, and two of my younger siblings also have some sort of nonbinary identity. They very clearly resent me for how terfy I was and honestly I deserve it. I was the oldest and I should have realized what was up and protected them, but instead I just made it worse. 

Anyway I feel awful. Im stuck at home around people whove seen what an evil person I can be and I feel so fucking ashamed all of the time."
"Cant find my gender ""identity"" or which (if any) community i belong to.",Throwaway_lostinlgbt,ainbow,"TL;DR: I don't know which flag I do belong to, i feel like as a male or female sometimes, most common being male as it is my birth gender; I do like, regardless of the sex, individuals of the female gender; Is it Gender Fluid? Androgyny? Poligender? Need help understanding where I stand on.  


So, throwaway account because this is too much personal for my main account, as this is possibly me coming out on the internet or something similar. I beg your forgiveness if that upsets you, but i don't feel ready to speak about it there yet.  
I'm posting here on r/ainbow because when looking for similar subreddits, i felt that here could be a more broad place to find answers and guidance. If this is not the subreddit for it, again, apologies.  


When I was 14ish, I've had the opportunity to explore sexuality a bit. All of it alone, but I had contemplated the idea of transitioning from male to female, having a relationship with a male, or similar subjects. At that time, I had ""decided"" that I was Cisgender and Heterosexual. For some time I had struggled a bit about it, because born in a christian home, I had no ""real option"" on what I was or wasn't. Time passed and I hit my 19th birthday. 

At that age, I grew out of the religion, and realized that my likings were more of a female gender, rather than female sex. I had no problem accepting that part of me, even though it was something that my parents and ex-church members would consider a sin/wrong or whatever else. But, even though I was starting to realize that I was wrong when 14, it didn't go much further.  
Some time later, i got a Girlfriend, at that time she was Cis and Hetero aswell, and we hit it off like I wouldn't imagine. Not some time later, we were living together due to unforeseen circumstances (she had to leave her parents house, and I was supposed to stay for a month, but ended up staying until now). Our relationship is great and i was able to put back a LOT of the stuff I had to withhold from my parents because of the religion they were in.

After that happened, I started exploring my sexuality again, and found a lot of new fetishes and we both enjoyed and explored them together. With that new ""world"", we explored the possibilities from using new toys, to thinking about the possibility of having a third person in our relationship. Some of those we were able to explore in action, and some we explored in thoughts. Some we we did and would keep doing, and some we decided that we wouldn't do. 

With all this going on, I opened myself and realized that sometimes I would like to be a female during intercourse, and sometimes, a male. This would have effect with me doing cross dressing, and being treated/cherished (I have no idea what verb to use) as one. Pegging was introduced, but I've realized that sometimes I wanted to be ""me"" male, and sometimes ""me"" female. My name could be used both by a male or female, and that was something that made me happy, as I could say I felt my feminine side was needing some attention and overall ""virtually nothing had changed"", but I was more ""fulfilled"" for being attended as female rather than male. I then realized I had a feminine side on me.

I spoke with her (GF) about it and she was supportive. She always was. She was going to accept me regardless of my sexuality, just as I did to her (she had found that perhaps she was not heterosexual a bit before that). She was going to be by my side. And I knew i could find who I really was. 

We then spoke about it again, and we figured out that: If we were in a ""first world like"" country, with a better paying job, we could explore way better what I could wear and what I would look like; I would be comfortable going out in public, if I didn't look like male, when dressed as female, or vice versa; Changing my body is a no, but the idea of having boobs is appealing enough for me to think about the possibilities (and there is also prosthesis that i could wear to make it more passable); and other minor things or that I don't remember now.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem with all of that is:   
\- I know I could dress/act/look like male or female at ""random"" points, changing them as I feel like who I should be today, both at home, in our intimate moments, or outside in the world.   
\- I know that I feel attracted to the female gender, regardless of sex. 

How is this ""categorized"" on the LGBT spectrum? Is it Gender Fluid? Is it Androgyny? Or Poligender?   
I feel like I have ""figured out"" who I am, but when trying to fit in somewhere I feel lost and can't find myself. What can I call myself? I've been my whole time doing it as Cis/Hetero, but that's not me anymore.   


Overall, thank you for reading until now. I apologize for any mistake i made up there, and if something wasn't clear, please point out and I will try and make myself better understood. (Obligatory english is not my first language here)"

"'Toxic'-insert gender here-, Culture, Media &amp; Trendiness",TrendinessIsntIt,ainbow,"Why is it okay to shut down what is considered stereotypical masculine activities, behaviours, and patterns while its perfectly acceptable to be entertained by stereotypical female equivalents? Why is it okay to shut down heterosexual activities, behaviours and patterns while its considered homophobic to do the same to gays? I hear toxic masculinity tossed around a lot along with a lot of other trendiness but the behaviour stays the same no matter what or who youre regurgitating. 

My question stems from being a gay male, not subscribing to gender roles, ideals or having a need to build subcultures around surface layer matters. I dont identify with labels except my birth biology which I find incredibly useful when Im sick or have to visit a doctor or the hospital. Doctors know not to check my ovaries in an emergency because they dont exist. The amount of effort people have put forward to researching human biology is truly a remarkable art the deserves a lot more respect than it gets. I try to be rational and sit with evidence based findings so I do believe theres in importance to understanding the difference between male and female biology. While I say this I am however aware of Trans-issues and LGBTQA+ theories. When I say that though I mean I dont equate gender materialism as being female or male. Theyre just things at the end of the day and I look at what theyre aimed to do, their function rather than gendering inanimate objects. And when I say theories I mean theories because that's what they are until they are further researched so that we can be certain. Especially when children are in the picture. It is important to have the ability to ask questions to these theories without fear of being called -phobic or prejudice as part of harm reduction and thinking in the long-term rather than immediate satisfaction. 

I try to sit with a lot of the content that comes out of my community. I try to hear a lot of the politics alongside the media and I cant quite relate. A lot of it is imposed symbolism and putting various things on pedestals when theres no substance to hold up their value. I often just see a mirrored scenario of something that could very well be considered problematic a decade or more down the line. In our current cultural and political climate, were addressing racial issues and the stereotypes around Black lives. We as humans have pumped out many jokes, movies, songs, etc in between all this time (many knowing it was wrong but it was a joke). All that media is now surfacing as being problematic and were all questioning how it all slid under our eyes. But if we stop and think about prejudice as a whole including womens rights issues that have been a thing for a long time wouldnt that make a lot of the projections gay culture put out there as being problematic? Equating materialism as a reason for why you have gender dysphoria is a dangerous road to take. Why? Because those items have nothing to do with being female in the first place. I see a lot of women fall into this trap feeling that they cannot be a woman unless they look or have a particular image. Some transition only to feel an unresolved issue at the core and regret transitioning. It happens. This is the equivalent to cisgendered women looking at altered photos and feeling less than ideal about the way they look. That they need a particular hairstyle, makeup look, outfit, etc to be accepted. The gay community pretty much does this across the board with gay media for men. The imagery for male bodies in gay culture are just like photoshopped images for women. You most likely wont see the same for lesbians though. I wonder if thats because theres already such a demand against women or if its because lesbians dont particularly get the same amount of visibility as gay men do in their communities. I do however tend to see lesbians more inclined to challenge the media in terms of what is viewed as acceptable. 

Is RPDR, drag shows, gay brands, etc going to take a hit once we stop idealizing what could be considered toxic femininity. To say RPDR doesnt push unrealistic, unattainable ideas is a stretch when theres body type idealization all over the series. All the men on the show are of one body type. The drag contestants often reinforce many of the problematic ideals women have to face on a daily basis. Theres the odd moment where we see a contestant say they dont feel comfortable unless theyre in drag but its dressed up as a heart filled moment rather than seeing that it takes hours for this person to feel better and if they dont put in the time every day theyll feel incomplete A lot of the humour on the show is also cattiness and taking jabs at each other in regards to weight, looks, and features. This is entertainment though its non-toxic Its cool to turn it into a meme or something that gets passed around with easy laughs. Continue to refer questionable people and people you make fun of as she and regurgitate your apparent wokeness.. Yet men are the problem says the men dictating how women should look in the media Rupaul is still a man choosing who wins the title or the archetypal status of a drag performer. 

I dont think theres a demand for the type of women were trying to breed an endorse in society and in the media. Im sorry but Im not entertained by being entitled and a diva nor do I find it a thing worth striving for. Id like to see us challenge this.   
 

This happens in dating as well with men having extreme expectations for sex in regards to being a top (the masculine one) or the bottom (the feminine one). Theres nothing to substantiate these roles but gay men love endorsing this mentality. Then we take this out of the bedroom and project it onto other men by categorizing each other as twinks, daddies, bears, sissies, etc. Theres no reason for why a bottom needs to act feminine or vice-versa its a stereotype, a projection of a belief that has no actual reason other than impersonating or acting like something else. Ive talked to some men who are completely baffled when I tell them I dont even take being a top or bottom or passive/aggressive into consideration when I meet a guy, get to know the guy, get in bed with the guy, whatever. We figure it out and explore each other like people do who have no former knowledge of these gay rules.  
 

I cannot relate and I find it impossible to discuss when this level of delusional thinking is so abundant. Many of the ones who partake in these behaviours are the ones being outspoken during these changing challenging times. Theyre the ones calling out people left and right and Im just really concerned that were all just dealing with people cling onto whatever is trendy or hashtagging rather than taking these things into practice.

Do you think I am bisexual?,CreakeyBroomwood,ainbow,"What really started making me question everything is when I saw Matthew Healy [Lead singer of The 1975] in the music video of [Love Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ5bZuUlftI) at Hardrock Cafe in NYC...woof.

I've never had anyone to speak to about attraction and/or anything sexual honestly in a  comfortable environment.  I've had I guess 'feelings' for both women and men throughout my life, what I mean is I don't know I can't describe it. It was just something about them that made me want to get to know them, be close to them, etc.

Basically I've always felt that I want to be with someone I feel comfortable with, that I don't always have to watch my back with and I don't really have any problem with the idea of making out with either gender. But here is the thing, I've never gotten sexually aroused to anything outside of porn and any sort of sexual dream I have my body forces me to wake up or shift away from it instinctively.  Like the only time I've ever gotten sexually aroused or 'hard' outside of porn and/or non-risk/taboo induced scenario, was when I was sitting next to senior guys in the school library who ended up talking about their dick sizes.

Idea of being with a girl isn't not appealing, like [SFW example] (https://i.imgur.com/qAx8Pqm.jpg) is appealing to me.

Idea of doing something with guys as a guy doesn't totally gross me out.

[SFW Example] (https://i.imgur.com/IGL4EPJ.jpg) Like the only thought running through my mind when viewing this selfie is how I'd like to push them down on a couch, undo their belt, unzip their fly and look up at them from my knees before servicing them basically thinking about stroking a guy, feeling him and hearing them moan makes my breath hitch as a warmth spreads in my stomach but I don't get hard.  Admittedly the thought of having another guy sexualize my throat and/or rear is kinda appealing but I've heard its not all that great like sucking on a meat flavored banana that you can't bite and like a wet handjob, but weaker plus I gag on a tooth brush :/ and when thinking about anal insertion in reality whether with dildos, fingers, lube, etc. I can't get passed the messy and unsanitary imagery though I've heard there's lots you can do without any anal stuff?

What really intimidates and scares me is if I do get involved with someone that I won't be able to 'perform' if you will, I guess I'm rather submissive and I really get off on ejaculation shots and creampies but I've heard sex is generally overrated, a lot of weird noises and how you're turned off when you pull out.

Basically I'm such a sheltered virgin that I had never actually seen abs on a guy in person before until my senior year when a jock was showing off at the hotel pool, then again when you go to a school where glances can get you bashed your eyes tend to stay on the ground [A location I spent the majority of my life believing I deserved to be, six feet of ground] and you get changed as quick as possible.  My um jaw kinda hit the floor if that means anything.

Had an intense dream about auditorium stages, a blue haired guy was performing, we locked eyes and I walked off stage stopping midstep before the next verse. Then I was skating on the connecting stage which could be seen from the side stage the blue haired guy was performing on flipping off landing on a group of chairs sideways. Then the blue haired guy noticed me and started singing too me, attempting to get me to come on the stage but I refused and someone in the audience was saying that I shouldn't. Then the performance ends but I can't let it go, next I was interrogating another guy I figure knew the blue haired guy asking where he was; finding out he was attending a strange party. When I arrived there was a 'Host'/'Bouncer' who controlled everything taking me to the blue haired guy in another room. Said blue haired guy had a sparkling blue patch Adams style clown nose on, noticing me gave a chipper hey but all I could do was stare at his lips and then he got so close I could feel his breath on my lips then something happened at the party and we separated.

Had a weird dream last night about sitting next to a guy at a table. their face was obscured, they were kinda emo-ish i guess. we were awkwardly chatting with whoever was a crossed the table from us, i reached my hand under the table like i was going to start rubbing him through his pants and then i woke up

Had a dream featuring a girl that i guess i had a crush on in 11th grade. we where walking down the school hallway side by side just awkwardly talking back and forth, i think about how she was dealing with losing her brother that was in the military [in real life her brother was fine in the military far as i know]. then everything got weirdly tense. she stepped in front of me, kinda putting her hand on my chest. she leaned in kissing me, then i started sliding my hand down the front of her jeans and then i woke up.

Had a dream about a guy that i guess i had a crush on in 11th grade featuring me in the back of a car freaking out sobbing with him opening the door reaching his hand out to me resulting in me backing away from him in fear.

Had a dream of drooling over a fictional version of a guy with abs taking off their shirt in the summer.

Had a dream about an attractive Arabic guy who I followed into a labyrinth style library in which we just talked and I found myself wanting to make out with them, maybe more.

Had a dream about a guy blowing me but I felt nothing then woke-up [I should've written this one out after it happened that was months ago :/]"

"The unfortunate consequences of using Tinder, Grindr etc. if you want a political career.",Bisexual_Slut,ainbow,"TL/DR:

Never posted on this sub before, but decided to cross-post here in case some of you are interested in this story.

There's a Democratic primary election in Massachusetts in a couple of weeks where Alex Morse, a 31yo gay man, is running against incumbent Richard Neal.

Timothy Ennis, an UMass college Democrat, made up a story that Morse ""abused his power"" through having consensual relationships on Tinder/Grindr, in a disgusting homophobic smear campaign. Why? In the hope that it would get a job with Richard Neal. Eventually, Morse was re-endorsed by the (far too many) groups that initially disavowed him.



The rest:

Alex Morse, a candidate for Massachusetts's 1st congressional district, worked as an adjunct lecturer once a week at the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a short-term basis. He has also been the mayor of a small city in Massachusetts since 2011 (not a typo, only 22 when elected!)

On Aug 7, the UMass College Democrats announced they had barred Morse from future events, alleging he had made students feel uncomfortable by abusing his position of power, making romantic advances, and engaging in sexual contact.[1] No specifics were given. Basically, he used Tinder and Grindr to meet people, some of which were students at the University THAT HE DIDN'T TEACH. Not only that, he didn't reveal he was the mayor (precisely to avoid the perception of any power imbalances). He didn't violate any university policy (obviously).

Many Democrats and Democratic organizations then, cowardly and shamefully, distanced themselves from Morse, some referencing parallels to MeToo, rape culture, etc etc (for a list of them, see [2]). To his great credit, his opponent in the election, Richard Neal, never used this 'allegation' against him, always stating he would wait for new evidence etc. (allegation in quotes because there is and was literally no allegation, just fluff written a couple weeks before the election). Eventually, Neal fully disassociated himself from these smears, noting their homophobic nature.

To quote from the original article from the college democrats: Alex Morse should know that as an elected official, a high-profile candidate, and a lecturer at a large public university, he holds a position of power over many young people, the letter said. Many young people around the state and around the country, especially those involved in College Democrats, view Morse as a role model, which renders it unacceptable for Morse to routinely make sexual or romantic advances, whether implicitly or explicitly.[1] So there are no specifics, but many assumed there was at least something actually backing this up when there wasn't.

So who started these false and homophobic smears? Timothy Ennis, the University of Massachusetts Amherst college Democrats chief strategist, who wanted to ""sink his [Morse's] campaign"". Why? ""I need a job... and Neal [Morse's opponent] will give me an internship"". So Timothy Ennis decided to track down Morse's dating profiles in the hope he would find something ""incriminating"".[2] I repeat this was the work of Timothy Ennis -- Richard Neal was NOT involved in any way. There's an ongoing investigation to the motivations for this smear. He planned to do this well in advance (October last year) and release it weeks before the election to sink his chances. (Someone should make this into a mini-series).

Many other journalists have come forward stating they were contacted by people wanting to take down Morse, all but confirming it was part of a smear campaign, e.g. [3] (luckily for Morse, Timothy Ennis seems to be completely incompetent).

As it became more and more obvious this was just a smear, Alex Morse received his highest donations week yet ($257,000) and most of the progressive groups that had un-endorsed or 'paused' their endorsements, re-affirmed their support (e.g. sunrise group, DSA, justice dems). Unfortunately, I'm still seeing his name accompanied with ""allegations of inappropriate behavior"" in most news articles I'm reading about him.

So why am I posting? It's important to send a message that people who represent us aren't expected to be celibate monks, and can (and should) have a sex life like the rest of us. And Timothy Ennis and all involved, drudging through the personal life of a gay man like it's the 1950s, obviously should have no future in politics, or any field where honesty and integrity are important. Being in Australia, I can't support his campaign, but appreciate Morse decided to run for office where this is to be expected. So also posting as a warning -- since he's running at a young age (31), I imagine this may be the canary in the coalmine, where the online dating lives of people running for office will continue to be dragged through the mud.

And great work from David Mack, the author of the Buzzfeed article which alerted me to this story, especially for highlighting the incredibly homophobic nature of Timothy Ennis' smear.

LGBTQ+ Engineers: Are you accepted at your workplace?,throwaway0920490,ainbow,"I am a gay, male engineer myself with 1.5 years in the field. In that short amount of time, I've already encountered a situation where I was called out in front of several individuals for my ""lady-like"" ways. This guy was referring to the fact that I am soft-spoken. It was more of sexist remark if anything, but definitely dissuaded me from being fully open in the workplace, such as sharing details about my boyfriend while other colleagues discussed significant others.

I'd like to gain a little more insight from engineers if you feel your work environment is inclusive to individuals regardless of sexual orientation. Feel free to comment on this thread, but also please fill out this quick 4 question poll I created here:

[Relationship Advice] My girlfriend has recently been hanging out with this guy. I think he has a crush on her. What do I do?,Astro_Lord,ainbow,"My [19f] girlfriend [19f] and I have been dating for 6 months (friends for longer). It has been amazing and the best relationship Ive ever had. We met in college and I fully intend to propose when we graduate (or when we both graduate grad school). I am committed to spending our lives together and she has expressed the same desire. Although we both dont want to make any rash decisions to avoid the whole UHaul thing. She is kind, intelligent, caring, loving, fun, hardworking, beautiful, and it doesnt hurt that we are compatible in other ways ;) 

Our communication is really great normally. We try to make sure the other persons needs are met as well as our own. So thats why I want to make sure I dont overstep my boundaries here.

Basically, she is really nice and nerdy and cute, so she always has guys falling at her feet (she is bisexual fyi). She has a hard time saying no and is always helping people. She is also somehow oblivious to these crushes and is always shocked when the guy reveals his feelings. She has a lot of guy friends who have professed their love for her that are still in her life. It makes me feel kind of weird, but I never say anything.

In the past, Ive always lost to a guy. In high school, I had multiple relationships/situationships. Pretty much every time, I got cheated on in favor of a guy or was left for a guy. The girls would always say they liked me more and we clicked better emotionally, but I guess they wanted a real dick. It really really hurt because I cant exactly control the fact that I dont have a penis. I dont trust men and I find myself feeling really jealous. 

In the past, Ive never said hey dont hang out with these guys or talk to them because I dont want to be controlling and she is her own person. But there is this new guy. She works at a dorm desk and last semester she sometimes played chess at work with this resident Adam. Fast forward to the new semester. Adam lives in the new building she is working at and he individually pulled out every decoration in his bags to show my girlfriend. She said he acted very awkward. The next day, he goes out of his way to hang out with her at her desk and goes across campus just to get her Starbucks because there was a bug in hers. The day after that (today), I wake up and see that my girlfriend said she is going to Target with Adam even though I had previously told her I wanted to go to the store with her next time she goes. 

I am very uncomfortable with this guy having a crush on her and spending alone time with her. I know she wont leave me for him, and I trust her, but I dont want his crush to grow to the point where he will try to spend time with her constantly (3 days in a row). It just makes me uncomfortable. Partly because guys typically dont respect lesbian relationships. There has been multiple occasions where guys will try to hit on her and ask her out even when she says she is in a relationship with me. 

I dont want to be controlling and I want to be a reasonable and good girlfriend. I dont want to push her away by being a jealous idiot. What do I do here? Should I tell her that Adam makes me uncomfortable? Should I tell her I think he has a crush on her? Needing some wlw advice here."

"Would ""demi-bi"" work to describe this, or would some other term fit better?",ChaosWolf1982,ainbow,"An artist friend of mine was musing about some of his OC's and the relationship they have (two lifelong best friends who are generally only attracted to men, but they occasionally have sex with each other, partly to ""relieve urges"" and partly as expression of their close bond with each other), and he came to this conclusion:

&gt;Y'know, it's funny. There was a time - and it seems like not long ago, but it has to be at least 12 years - that I would never have considered doing ""girl-girl"" sex pics. Even more so if it involved any of my existing characters; as far as I was concerned at the time, my girls were enthusiastically heterosexual, end of story. And it had to do with the fact that, at the time, I wasn't a big fan of ""girl on girl action"".

&gt;I'm not sure what changed; but I'm now finding out that I do enjoy drawing my female characters in intimate enjoyment of each others' bodies, particularly my two ""main characters"". Maybe the two were always bisexual, and they just never realized it. (I theorize it's because both women are attracted to men on a largely physical basis, but attracted only to women with whom they already share an emotional attachment; and in those cases it's not an attraction to women just as women, but to a person they already love.)

And in reply to him, I said this:

&gt;Hmm... bisexual/biromantic is having sexual/romantic attraction to more than one gender, and demisexual/demiromantic is having sexual/romantic attraction only to someone you have developed a close emotional bond with...  So your two ladies could be ""demi-bi"", to turn a phrase, perhaps? Sexually attracted to men and women, but for women only if there's already an emotional connection there?

But then I got to wondering if that term fit well. It feels close, but isn't quite there.  It's a very interesting relationship dynamic, and I'm rather curious what others' views and opinions of it might be!"

"I taunted a widow who lost her cop husband while on duty, and now several friends have disowned me. How do I convince them its okay to taunt these people?",effpeauxpeaux,ainbow,"I initially posted this in the relationship sub but the straights just dont quite understand how thoroughly evil ALL cops are without exception, so Im posting it here.

I live in a city known for corrupt cops. In my apartment theres a couple who lives on the first floor, the husband was a cop.

I say was because he recently met his end while on duty. I know this because a few people in the building had talked about it. Many were upset. I was positively giddy; the only good cop is a dead cop and I will never feel sympathy for them.

To celebrate his demise, I bought bacon (with cash, among other groceries) and placed it on the steps of the widows apartment with the note I hope your PIG husband is burning in hell, cunt.

Nobody knew it was me (no security cameras in the building), but some of the other tenants are FURIOUS. My neighbor told me that whoever did this is an absolutely awful person and they should really think about how their actions affect others.

I find that pretty funny because the cop never once considered how his job inherently oppresses others. The cop never once considered how he is an evil person by joining the force, and his wife is evil because she knowingly married into a corrupt system and gets to lay back and rest easy while her husband oppresses the poor. Theyre all rotten to their very core. All of them.

One day I came home and I saw her in her pajamas slowly walking up and down the halls just silently crying. She looked utterly broken and like she hadnt bathed in days and there was a look in her eyes that she just wasnt all there anymore. I broke down laughing once I got to my apartment.

I was relaying the story and the results to my friends the next time we hung out, and several of them were disgusted by what I did and how you dont seem to regret what you did at all.

I quite literally dont. Im very proud of what I did and I hope this woman offs herself. I told that to them and several of them got up and left after that. They wont answer any of my texts or calls, and a few have told me to leave them alone. 

How do I convince them that what I did was okay?"

Former Trump Adviser Says Joe Biden Is Homophobic,gayandlove,ainbow, 
Rant,vibgyor99,ainbow,"We all have some sexual preferances (accept asexuals since they are asexual but they do have preferances based on personalities). The thing is having a sexual preferacce for a gender, sexuality, race, age group (except under age people) isn't racism at all. Racism is being discriminatory or hateful against a person since they belong to a racial or ethnic group. Of course just because you aren't attracted to someone doesnt give you any right to be a jerk to someone who approaches you (for romance , friendship or hookups).

Sexual attarction is involuntary. We don't choose to be sexually attracted to someone. If you find someone to be attractive but they reject you since you aren't attarctive or interesting to them doesnt imply they are racists.

If you think they are racist for not dating brown man (just an example also I am brown) then you are doing sexual racism for being attarcted to a specific gender too (if you identity as gay, lesbian, straight). This is so stupid"

Teachers looking for advice on inclusivity,ThrowAway3323489,ainbow,"Hey everyone,

My wife and I are both high school teachers (she teaches foreign languages, I teach special needs) and steadfast allies of the LGBTQ+ community.  My wife recently got a message from a FTM trans student before we've even started classes asking my wife to refer to him by he/him pronouns and his preferred names, but also stated he is not out to his parents.  We have no problem at all with that!  In fact, it gave us the idea of creating a form together that we want to share with our respective students to fill out.  It would **strictly** be on a voluntary basis but also would be a way to let students know our classrooms are a safe space where their identities are respected and confidentiality is honored.  Trying to keep it short and sweet but would love to include any questions you feel would be good to add, especially from QTPOC.  If I'm using outdated terminology, PLEASE correct that as well.  We only know what we've been taught and we are always open to adapting the language accordingly.  Here are the questions we have so far.

1. Name (as shown on attendance)*
1. Preferred name (nickname, chosen name, etc.)*
1. Gender Identity (male, female, nonbinary, etc.)
1. Preferred Pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.)

That's as much as we can think of.  If you have ANY suggestions for what we can add to this without getting too personal.  We just want to be able to show we respect the students and their identities.

**NOTE:** Except for their given names and chosen names, all questions will be voluntary and made clear they only have to answer if they're comfortable doing so."

Is it okay to flip off and taunt the police that drive by my house?,flippedoffflipper,ainbow,"My house &amp; street seems to lie on a patrol path, because every day around the same time (once in the mid-day, once late at night) a patrol car drives past my street. This has been going on for several years so this wasnt triggered by current events.

I dont actively seek them out, but if Im out when they drive past, I make sure to flip them off and occasionally Ill shout insults at them. The cops in my town arent known for brutality or corruption but I dont care, I fucking hate ALL cops with every fiber of my being and I have for years. Im interracial but none of those races are black.

The cops themselves dont really stop. Theyve occasionally slowed down and given me some glances, but they dont really engage.

I was telling my parents about this the other day and theyre mad, saying my behavior is disrespectful. My dad (a dark brown immigrant) said I dont like a lot of cops either but you have no idea what kind of cop is behind the wheel when you taunt them. 

I responded with theres only one type of cop: a bad one.

He then said that is exact same type of mindset that people use to justify hatred against people like you and me. He also likened my hatred to the homophobia (Im gay) he witnessed growing up, and how people would do the same thing to suspected gay people who were just walking down the street.

I told him that being a cop isnt a race or a sexual orientation; its a profession, and you choose your profession. The cops made a choice to be evil, the cops choose to be bad, and I dont see why I should be civil with people I hate.

The last thing he said was what you just said is almost word for word what Ive heard people say to justify wantonly persecuting people like you and me and he wanted to stop talking about it after that.

I didnt really know what to say to that. Is he right? Am I just being a hateful dick?"
being in the LGBT community with LGBTphobic parents is a struggle,froggaey,ainbow,"my parents have always been very judgemental towards the LGBT community. i remember them making fun of gay people or steering me away from a gay couple anytime we saw one in public. they still do crack hurtful jokes towards enbies and gays. i've always been a very accepting person, but they had tried to teach me that identifying as anything other than cishet was wrong.

there were several instances when they had commented on people who identified outside the binary. they said anyone who didn't identify as either male or female were kidding themselves and ""making up genders"".

over the past year i went from being an ally to realising i belong in the community - gender, romance, and sexuality wise. seeing as i still live with my parents for a couple more years, i'm forced to stay in the closet from everyone other than online or face being punished by my family.

 i had just always felt ashamed of identifying as LGBT when i was told by my parents that it was wrong, and of being a part of a family who judges others for something they can't choose. it's nice to be able to see such kind and accepting people here.

this turned out longer than i expected, but thank you if you read it all haha i hope you all have a good day :)"

"How exactly do you ""identify"" as a different sex?",acerthorn,ainbow,"I consider myself a straight ally. I support gay rights. So please do not be offended by any ignorance I may display in this thread. After all, how am I supposed to get rid of my ignorance if I don't ask questions? So please be patient with me.

Anyway, while I can certainly understand how some people can be gay or bisexual, I don't quite get how they can ""identify"" as any gender other than what they're actual gender is. I hold no ill will whatsoever against people who want to undergo sex reassignment surgery. What I'm confused by is how they even ""identify"" as a sex they clearly are not, in the first place.

Think about it this way: As a straight male, I can at least understand the concept of *being attracted to men*, even though I am not attracted to men, myself. That at least has a sufficient connection to real life. If you are a gay male, then that means [this guy](https://i.postimg.cc/Hk6g4dBZ/A.png) must be attractive to you ... or at the very least he is of the sex that you typically find attractive.

But when I look down at my crotch when I'm naked, I can clearly see a dick and a scrotum. When I touch that scrotum, I can feel two balls inside it. I feel my jaw and the area around my mouth, and I feel a beard. I feel my chest, and I once again feel hair there. As such, I identify as male ... because I am quite clearly male!

I just can't wrap my head around how people can see their own bodies and somehow ""identify"" as the opposite sex. Do you, or did you used to, menstrate? Do you, or did you used to, have the ability to get pregnant? Do you have boobs? Do you have a vagina? If you answered yes to all of those questions, well then ... you're a woman! How can you possibly be anything but a woman?! If you want to *become a man*, I can certainly understand that. While I have no desire to change my own sex, the concept of wanting to change one's sex is still sufficiently tangible that I can wrap my head around it.

But to actually identify as a man *in the present*, when you are very clearly a woman *in the present* ... how does that work?

That would be like thinking you're an alien. Unless you look in the mirror and see [this](https://store.playstation.com/store/api/chihiro/00_09_000/container/BG/en/999/EP2402-CUSA05624_00-AV00000000000012/1576760052000/image?w=240&amp;h=240&amp;bg_color=000000&amp;opacity=100&amp;_version=00_09_000) in your own reflection, then it is quite preposterous to consider yourself an alien. That's not to be confused with *wanting to travel to other planets*. Again, that's a tangible desire that I can comprehend. But actually thinking that you already are on a planet you're not from? To think that of yourself is a sign of mental illness. If you repeatedly insisted that you were an alien, you would likely be committed.

Can somebody please explain how this whole ""gender identity"" thing actually works?"

I want to believe that it doesnt matter who you love, all that matters is you love. Sometimes i think maybe love isn't for everybody. But i want that thought to die. So...can you help me find my Him?"

So I recently got into watching Community. Amazing TV show, highly underrated, nothing will ever change that. I recently confided to a friend that *some* gay jokes in Season 1 may not have aged well in 2020. She replied by saying that it's expected for such jokes to be the norm at a time like 2009, and I agree. However, I was wondering what other peoples opinions are regarding this. Community is not the only TV show that relied on gay jokes; (in fact, it has relied on gay jokes the least compared to other TV shows released at that time) The Office, Parks and Recreation, and Gilmore Girls. Can you feel sensitive to these gaffes and still enjoy the show or do you have to put your feelings and sensitivity aside? Or is it something in between?"

This raises the question of: how are we supposed to now label those who are attracted to the same or opposite sex? Why was it necessary to redefine the old terms?"

Particularly the trans community, Im a female, however Ive always done boyish things. I hang out with boys, I do boy things, Ive always wished to be a boy. I hate my breasts, and wear hoodies to hide them. But I never took these things seriously, I assumed this was normal, people who dont wear glasses want glasses, vice verse. And maybe hating my boobs is a growing up thing. But now that Im looking into it, Ive had an instant  gravitational pull to it. I am worried though.
A) Im afraid of how my parents would think of me.
B) Im afraid its going to be a phase, or maybe Im faking or something.
C) I know theres a difference between your gender identity, and clothing, but I still like feminine things, is that normal??
D) Im worried that maybe Im just an extreme tomboy, and Im taking it too far.
I would really appreciate it if someone could give me advice, or tell me about their experiences. I cant discuss it with anyone in person, so this is my only way to get advice. Apologizing in advance for poor grammar, as its 3 am at the moment and Im tired.

"Goodbye LGBTQ+ of Reddit, Thank you for everything!!",Baby_gay002,ainbow,"I'm sorry but this is gonna probably be a seriously long post, but please bear with me

I ~~think~~ know i'm gay, I like men and since puberty hit me I've only liked men, and I like liking men- phew...that fake coming out to random internet strangers has made me feel better than anything in my life. Finally I've come to realize I LOVE BEING GAY.

My past was mostly confusing, since there was no sex ed for me and my dad and mom haven't yet talked to me about the birds and bees. I thought I liked girls and being from a family that is far right did not help at all, and as you may have guessed they are VERY religious. Thus the whole coming out in the beginning kinda makes sense, this is the best I can do right now and probably for sometime(actually a long time). Somebody has to know that this random username on Reddit is gay, and that is all I need for now.

Growing up religious was the best thing ever, there was a being, who had infinite power and wisdom and could do anything, and all you had to do was chant some verses in an unknown language,and he would do anything you wish no matter how impossible it seems. That is the best thing a mortal being can ask for, and if you did stuff that the being felt was right meant you can spend an eternity in the ""good"" place. But I've come to realize GOD DOES NOT EXIST. Thus i'm not bound by my religion's views about homosexuality.

Now that I have all that said I am going to leave from my country to a relatively more homophobic country for a higher education. This means nobody can know for a long time about my secret. This means I have to leave from Reddit to the real world, i have always been comforted by all the stories of your lives, hoping the same for my own, yet I rejected it as mere fantasy. But if someone can make up an entire religion to cover up them cheating on their husband, I can achieve the future that I want-to move to a more accepting country, settle down, find a loving husband,kids maybe dogs/cats or both. I have decided to let go of the only source of comfort for years to get the future that I want for a lifetime.

I'm gonna post this on as many subreddits as I can, so that many people can know, and give me hope (so mods please remove if not appropriate). I will only be able to access Reddit for a few hours from now, so WISH ME THE BEST OF LUCK.

so yours truly,

My friend said Im being bigoted for rejecting someone for being HIV+. Is that true?,breakupthrowoawayxox,ainbow,"A few months back I met Dustin through my friend Kevin. Everyone involved in the story is a gay cisgendered male in their twenties, just an FYI.

Dustin is a nice guy, very charming, and he looks good. We hit it off and went on a few solo hangouts/dates (we never called them dates but there was chemistry that was more than just platonic).

Well, things were starting to heat up between us, but before they went toward anything sexual he told me he wanted to have a real talk. I obliged, he sat me down and explained that he is HIV+.

Im fully aware that having HIV doesnt mean youre a bad person, nor does it mean youve necessarily made bad choices (I will not reveal the circumstances behind him contracting the disease, but I will say that it didnt happen how most people would think it did). Im also aware that people with HIV can live full, healthy lives. Dustin himself is what is considered positive undetectable, meaning that - as long as he adheres to his medication - he is incapable of transmitting the disease to another person.

I thanked him for his honesty but I told him Id rather be friends, at least for now. I know the risks are virtually zero should anything happen, but if something *were to* happen Im not currently insured and dealing a diagnosis is not something Id like to add on to my responsibilities during a global pandemic, especially when healthcare isnt exactly cheap for someone like me right now.

Dustin was a bit disappointed but understood, we agreed that we like hanging out with each other regardless. Kevin...not so much.

Kevin privately told me Im being discriminatory and body shaming Dustin. He said that Im giving in to homophobic propaganda and exhibiting internalized-homophobia because Im not willing to pursue things romantically with Dustin.

I told him that get that people with HIV are unfairly maligned, and I get that there should be less of a stigma surrounding people who have HIV, I just dont see why that means I need to date someone with HIV to end the stigmas surrounding it. Kevins response was that he was disgusted with my bigoted behavior. And he left it at that.

I really dont know what to feel here. Am I being bigoted? Should I reconsider how I feel about Dustin? I havent told him what Kevin said yet, but Im wondering if I should? Idk, where do I go from here?"

"Hello Reddit , I need your help! Or my end will become to me soon (). Reddit is my last hope. I'm broken and I don't think that I gonna live if nothing is gonna change. I'm hopeless, my life is meaningless no one even gonna care about my death, even my parents! I can't live here anymore.",lolzzz992,ainbow,"Hello my name is Sofia I'm 16 years old and I'm from Russia and I have 2 years to survive before my end.

A while ago I made one post in subreddit about immigration, but everything I got is a lot of downvotes and mainly got ignored. Like I got ignored by everything my whole life.

First of all, I gonna say why I have a time limit, there a lot of reasons for that. I don't sure what I should begin, but in short my current status:

* I have big problems with my family. Begining with no right to at least have a hair cut ending with dad that can get drunk, go back home and destroy everything, and beat my mom. Every day when both parents are home there are endless scandals and constant words about divorce.
* My mother always telling me about her problems since I was a little child. And keep talking like I was born to help her and at the same time, she can say why did I give birth to you. I sometimes respond with ""I didn't ask you to give birth to me""
* Even my little brother hates me, make fun of me, call me a girl, that I look like a girl (don't sure how I should react, because I'm transgender), can punch me... I mean will punch me.
* Also, I eating instant noodles and the cheapest food, because we don't earn very much, a few times we don't even have enough money to pay for rent.
* I crying for almost every day. And it's doesn't even matter when my parents saw it, like if it was ok to always cry.
* I have problems at my school. Not only school bullies have hated me, but also some teachers. Bullies can beat me with a big crowd and even if I going lye down they gonna kick me.
* I can't be myself. I can't have my own opinion, every opinion is done by my mother, I can't say It's bad, but sometimes I don't want to be a robot that does whatever they say with no rights to say ""I want"" or simply say ""no""
* I have no friends because they weren't my actual friends. I always used to be their doll with they can play. They betrayed me, they make fun of me.
* I have nightmares, my past is haunting me. It's made even one scar on my hand.
* If I don't escape this country I will be doomed. When I will be 18 there will be forced conscription that has a problem with ""Dedovshchina"". People like I don't survive there, in the Russian army, it's not for weak people.
* I tried to suicide, but I never go too far.
* No one even cares about me, most of the people that I know hate me, no one can help me, even I...
* I scared of everything, I can't even write to people online, I just scared of them.
* A lot of transphobes make fun of me almost every day.
* Every day I keep thinking about self-harm. And sometimes I do this.
* Every time I want to do something to help myself there is something that trying to stop me and if I try to avoid that everything will be even worse than before.
* I lost belief in humanity. I don't even sure if it even exists.
* My dysphoria is killing me, but with depression, it feels so bad. I can't look at the mirror.
* My country took last rights from trans people so I can't live here anymore
* I'm useless I can't do anything. I can't draw, I can't even complete even an easy target. I'm so stupid...
* I'm broken and I have no sense to live on. Should I continue?......

So this is a small portion of everything that happened to me. I going to tell you some stories and going to open some of these themes that I listed above. I'll begin with my parents. 

When I was 10 years old or less my dad always lost all money in casino on a slot machine. He worked as a guard in the same casino where he lost all money. Once he almost gave away our apartment like that.

Now we running out of money because of coronavirus. He was working at the hotel as a guard. The hotel went bankrupt and we didn't receive payment for 3 months. And he was working not legal there so we were totally dead.

Basically, we trying to survive (4 people) on around $544/month but as I said he loves to lose money so it's looking more like $408/month for 4 people but mainly even less. We need to use them to pay for two apartments that look like very bad, having two bad looking apartments in a bad city doesn't mean we rich. And also we need to pay for an extra apartment where we all live. Sometimes we are being sued for not paying at the right time.

Also, there was a stupid situation so we almost got homeless. My dad's father had our apartment, and so he cheated on my grandmother, who was not even close to me, I never saw her until I was 14 years old and eventually, a child was born, later my dad's father died and their family claimed inheritance, including our apartment, they were also rich and this angered me the most, like why they need our apartment in with we live, but also my mom telling about these problems to me. I was around 10.

The baby is one year old. His Parents: WE NEEAD AN APARTAMENT FOR HIM Because HE iS a bik Boi

We don't even have wallpapers before. Just empty walls actually that place still don't have wallpapers everywhere. Mainly, this was because my dad is lazy he doesn't do anything, he was doing only: Farting on the couch, playing video games on smartphone, annoys everyone, etc. Every hard work was done by my mother and with some of our help (kids)

My dad. He doesn't give a fuck about us. And he always will. He living only for himself and only for himself.

The due first month of quarantine in Russia I was eating only one time per day.

When we had no money, father was god knows where, we can't even live in our house at this moment we lived in grandma house and grandma can't even give money or support us somehow, so mainly we were hungry, 

So I hate my dad, but not my mom, she just trying to save us from our dad.

My mom trying to control my life, watching my every step, it continues to my 14 years old, then and for today she just annoys me with asking what I was doing today or who do I write to, etc.

Also, my mom sometimes trying to make suicide, and it's so hard to stop her, she just going to our medkit and start eating every drug. It's terrible.

My mom and my brother love to make fun of me. Trying to annoy me and made me cry. Telling jokes about me, and if I don't act like I don't care, they gonna make fun of me even more.

My mother almost every time very sick. She just sneezed and broken spine or something, she felt so bad, so she crying of pain I asked her for calling to a hospital, but she declines. Every time she looks like she gonna die right now she doesn't want to call for help to the hospital.

Yesterday (6th August) my mom almost set the whole house on fire, by putting a wooden circle on a gas stove and then a big bowl of bad soup, and then after a while, it ignited, and a great column of fire rose and a lot of smoke came out.

My dad drunk at least one time per week. He often loses his items such a phone because he literally can sleep under the fence of some house. He destroyed a lot of things in our house. The fridge still has traces of his punches. Rarely, but he can punch me. He doesn't love me at all, he loves only his second son.

Endless scandals. I don't even know what to say about it. I can't protect anyone anymore when dad is angry.

And things that always with me. Whatever someone does something bad, they told me that it was I. In a time of school it makes me wanna die because the whole class told the teacher that I PUNCH myself, poor bullies, how dare me!

While I was in my classroom due to math lessons, there was break time and I sat in my class since I don't have friends and reasons to go out. And then my classmate ran in class with words that I stole sled of some little kid, then class appears and say that's it's true and we saw you, then the school principal and homeroom teacher appeared and they saying that they got me and me in big trouble but God was on my side in this day and teacher start to debate with them how I can steal something while I'm in school sitting in this classroom! Thankfully she able to approve that they wrong. Actually, this is the first time and last time that someone saved me from hell. But all school already thinks that I stole a sled of little kid.

Also, they love to stalk me to my home and scream that I'm ""gay"" and ""pussy"" and other words. When I go downstairs they very often trip me up and then I fall very badly. They also love to hide my clothes so I stay in school for many hours to find my cloth.

I was in school bullies start to say that I miserable, doesn't deserve a feature and many things, but when I can't take it anymore and say something in their side they start to kick me with a crowd, I was laying down, and 4 people just keep kicking me, whole class watch this everyone was happy they said punch harder, kick harder! I think it just like forever.

But at some point it's ended, I can't feel anything, I don't even stand up, I just cried. Then the teacher walks in class and saw me. I think she was thinking ""oh no he\* is crying again!"". Then she said stand up and said go with me, I thought she will finally help me, but I was so wrong. She went with me to high school (I never was in there at this moment), to the headmaster of this school. I sat in her cabinet and she starts to scream at me that everyone got tired of you and you should die we will kick you from school because of your behaviors. I just crying and can't even listen to all the things that she said, I thought I just disappointed my mom. After 1 hour and more of scream at me she said stand up, we gotta go, I asked what do you mean? but don't get a response back. We walked outside with a fire exit door, there was a black tuned car and it has a lot of people inside. At this time I thought I'll die and I start to say sorry for everyone, but mainly for my mother. I thought we gonna ride in the forest because I never saw these places before, the whole road I just praying. No one is speaking. Finally, I saw my house, and parked at the entrance to the entrance (It looks like English doesn't have this word), she said to go out but gives me some document. I slowly walked upstairs, every step I felt worse and worse, and finally, when I was on the 5th floor I ring to door, my mom opened the door I gave her this document and when she asked me ""What happened?"" I started to cry again and fall on my bed. The document contains something about my expulsion from school. It was my worst day. You can say me, why you can't change school but in a place where I live before, there was only one school.

Is I'm a bad person? I'm always tried to help people and animals if I can.

I stop at least three people and my mother of suicide in real life.. don't sure if this counts...

I destroyed a lot of ""columbine"" community everywhere I can and trying to help people, change their minds. So I stop many people of suicide and killing everyone in schools.

There was a thing as 'The Groups of Death' most popular was ""Blue whale"". It was a game in real life where you do some tasks, but then it quickly flows into tasks like ""cut your wrist"" and so on. The ending of this game is to kill yourself, doesn't matter with way, but mainly it's just jumping from a rooftop. I was horrified about this, so I had an idea to create an anti-group of death called ""Pink Flamingo"". Everything was fine, I helped a lot of people, make therapy for them, give advice, and at the end of the game you should be alright and happy, there was no real end. But in one day my group was banned from Vkontakte as I remember for this reason: I created a group of death. Bravo, they even block my own page almost permanent, it was hard to restore it, it was a special ban.

I really remember that I made a lot of happy birthday congratulations on things in windows movie maker to everyone... I was 8 years old or less... I always helped grandmothers, carrying their products, or moving them across the road.

Some bullies wanted to kick poor cat to death, I don't let them do that, so they kicked me... BUT hey! I saved a cat!

When I had internet ""friends"" we had a community, I called it ""TeaTown community"", we were like a big family, I helped to everyone there, they need something I give it to them and a lot of other things, yes they kinda don't like me because I always want to help everyone and it annoys them. And in one day we built a big city with a 10+ player population and I started this community brick by brick with a new friend (everyone knew them even before I appear there) and in one day after a month of friendship he just asks me to add his friend to private since I don't know him and I was scared of security and for everyone, I said no! They start to scream on me and call me a pussy and such and I add him under this pressure and then they immediately kill me and destroyed my house and storehouse of the city I was broken they even used cheats so I can't fight with them. But it's not all, they told something to all of my friends, and everyone started to hate me and they start to don't trust me. I managed to get a little bit of their trust and I became a part of this community again. I build a church and live in there. I still helped to everyone. But in one day someone busted me, he gives access to church to those two who grief me before and then they destroyed my church, no items survived. I actually have a few footages where they were cheating and griefing. Actually, I showed it to admins. And guess what? I got permanently banned. They bought the admins. The main conflict is very stupid, to solve it I need to apologize for not letting them grief me and don't add them immediately to private. Also one of them always saying something I'm a god and you're nothing.

When I finally realized that I'm transgender, I made a coming out and every friend that I have, even my best friend start to hate me even gay one and it made me feel very bad. A was lone for a month and since I can't find new friends I tried to go back to them. They made a lot of transphobic things like burning the trans flag, mis-pronouns me and everything, but in one day they reach something above of normal, when I died I teleported in a strange place, they made a test lab that I need to pass, they gave me adventure mode, some of them was in spectator mode, my ""best friend"" was behind glass, they said hello and then look in the chest I saw a pufferfish that named ""Trans have no right"" they say eat it. I eat it, don't sure why. The next thing was a potion, that I need to drink to be female, but unfortunately, It doesn't work and I got aids, then they give me a wooden pickaxe and said to dig obsidian... 4 blocks of obsidian with a wooden pickaxe, sick bastards! Then there was another room with insane hard parkour. After a while, I passed it and I got into another room where I should choose one of three answers, in fact, some of them were not transphobic like there was a question about Kazahstan with dates. At the end of the quiz, they hide the right answer behind me, so it should make me confused, once it solved I went to the final room. I saw to ""dicks"" and my best friend said choice dick, sit and die, there was a big black one with racism on a sign that gonna destroy all my organs because it's a big and sticky white one with gonna pull out my guts and made me die. I don't remember what I chose, but it was horrible we was a friend for many years and then they do this? How sad, even my ""best friend""

Since that, I don't really have friends anymore.

All my classmates around me in school used drugs and they were very bad and none of them want to be my friend. This why I never had a friend in real life. Everyone in real life was very bad, many of them were in police stations already. Even girls were bad, they drunk too much and engaged in prostitution.

All the people I knew had a boyfriend/girlfriend/whatever at some point, but I never had, so they very shooked when they knew this fact, but I don't think I need that, I don't think I need something, maybe I just don't deserve life. In fact, I don't even sure with sexual orientation is I or do I even want to have someone.

I hate to remember the place where I lived before because of school, memories, and thing like:

I just going to home from school and then from nowhere on a large speed a big van is riding on the sidewalk not even giving any sign. I jumped out at the last moment. It still gives me nightmares. 

Or like when someone kicked me in school when I was going downstairs and then when I was going home someone walking far away and scream that I'm ""faggot"" and other words but then I saw two small dogs. Nothing special, but then huge dogs start to appear from nowhere and I start thinking about going back and find another way to go home, but when I turn my head I realized I already surrounded by huge evil dogs that barked and growled at me and then ran sharply at me. A big crowd of dogs surrounded me and chased me all over the city and I was running for my life, most of these dogs were huge, and I ran from almost 20 dogs. Honestly, I don't know why they can't catch me and where most of them gone when I was pretty close to my home, but it's doesn't matter. Yes and I cried and scream the whole road to home.

Just a typical day of my life. Mainly when I home I'll be saved. But every time I outside. Something bad is going to happen.

Also, teachers called me rude words and lower my grades. Imagine being a kid and the teacher call you a bag of shit that can't do anything.

I was in this place a week ago and I was praying to my mother to not go there, but she starts to say I never coming outside and I should ride or else I can say bye to my laptop. We stuck there for three days we just should be there for one day. We don't even have pillows or blankets. And I meet old school bullies that start to make fun of me one of them even punches me. He called me ""faggot"" again like in past. It was a nightmare. Everyone hates me there. My little brother hates me because I want to leave this nightmare as fast as I can, but he wants to be there for a longer time. I actually made a wrong thing later. 

I wanted to escape and my reason for that was If stay there even more I will kill myself because so many horrifying memories' was there. I just walked to a train station, so basically I escaped from a mom and my little brother. And a bully from school walked to me, I didn't saw him and he said ""Fuck you"" and then he punches me in a face. Well then since I have no money with me right now (and always), so I have a ""perfect"" Idea to walk to my city on foot (48KM to the final station and also a long way to the city), but I just walked just one station is about 4km from there and I got already tired, but also at this moment I realize that I don't have keys for the apartment and also I need to go another 10+ stations + another more things I don't think of, so I went back.

The second reason I do so is that my mom and my brother start to make jokes about me and I just can't stand it.

I returned to a nightmare place and we got stuck here. I still feel very bad.

Actually, this isn't a serious escape because in one-day whole class the whole day made fun of me by calling me with bad words, they tripped me, they spat paper at me, and do much more. And the teacher remarked not to them but ME. I wonder why??? Then everything like in a fog. It was the end of the lesson and someone made my cry, I run out of class and saw fire exit, with tears, I very fast open this door and ran out of school, they tried to stop me, they even grab my backpack, but I ran away. So next I was thinking about getting drown or just die in the forest, maybe even of starving to death, but temporarily I hide somewhere and lay down there. It was a very cold autumn. I don't even wear a jacket and I was alone, thinking about suicide and the end of me, I was laying on trash, I even thought about live like a hobo, Because I can't live like that anymore. My mom can't do anything to help me she can't do it to end. So bullies can't get punished because of that. I always was in bruises. Even more, bullies have come up with an offensive nickname for me because of which I want to change my last name. The worst part that this thing also works in English and almost in every country, because this word sounds almost the same even though it writes very differently.

My poor relatives made me feel very sad and bad, but not every one of them. Looking at an old, lonely grandfather it's so heartbreaking, it's so awful to see a poor uncle stricken with a stroke and other can laugh on the situation, it's so wrong... also recently grandfather killed a cat... he put it somewhere and close it... he doesn't even feed it... a week passed... and then he opened a place where he put cat... but it's already almost died... on next day cat just died.....

Well, I don't do anything bad. I always tried to help people. But everything I received from them it just hates and other sad things. Nothing good. Yes, I made bad stuff and I apologize for that. I apologize that I was born. Wow, it hurt so much. I upset my parents. And I will upset them even more.

Teachers say there is no way I saying the truth because I can't always be ""White and fluffy"". I mean no one even trusts me for some reason. My friends busted me.

I always, every day, for many years keep talking to my parents that I'm going to make suicide, but they say that I don't saw a real-life, I don't live enough, and what kind of troubles you can even have in this age?

My family and other people keep told that my life is not the worst and I can agree. They can say the other one lives is worse than me, you at least have food, water, and a roof overhead, people from Africa are very poor, do you think about them? Yes, often think about poor people and that they need more help than me in fact I'm living very well in their background.

When I was a child I was thinking about writing a book about my life and write it when I will grow up, but now I don't find this idea very good. In fact, it's very stupid. I always feel stupid. Everyone thinks I'm stupid, retarded, or something. And I can kinda agree with them.

And I can't help myself because something will stop me and made feel me even worse and no one can help me. Every time I want to make animation, website, or whatever my programs got crashed, light turn off for the whole house, I lost internet connection, I got lost files or even worse corrupted because it most painful and any possible way to stop me from working that you can imagine.

I know odd people that sometimes can come from nowhere and write something odd. Something about eggs, something about fursuits while why do I in the world even want to know the cost of this? I don't hear you for months and you come back and say interesting how much fursuit is a cost or even ""docking"", various sort of things. There were only people that I talked with for like 5 months. I feel so terrible. For some things, I feel like I was raped and I don't even kidding.

First of all, I gonna say why I have a time limit, there a lot of reasons for that. I don't sure about what I should begin, but the current status that I'm suffering from Bullies, of my Family, of my Government, and what is going on in my country.

I tried to find transgender friends in Russia, but then I realized that it's an almost impossible challenge since most of them not just dressing and do other staff. Even when I saw an infinite number of almost always gross people I find the right thing, but even there I find bad people. One of them was younger than me he was 15 years old and then after a long conversation he said that he gives jobs to his boyfriend and do such things and send me some images, I try to change his mind, but he doesn't want to listen to me, he just enjoy that. And other transgenders I found were good people, but they weren't sure if they were transgender, but it still better than nothing. They never called me a friend in fact when I asked, they answer that we, not friends. And it broke my heart... I realized that I never had friends.

I scared to start to speak with anyone. When I don't speak everything usually better. So I can't say even a single word. 

Almost every night I have a nightmare about someone is trying to catch me and I trying to escape. It could be everything and mainly I ran in deserted places even if there should be a lot of people in them. The alternative ending is the screamer version so I can't even run for a while before screamer, I instantly got caught. Also there another type of dream where I walking on familiar but very changed places, most scary that before it had many people, but since every dream there less and fewer people, and everything got weirder and weirder, so everything change, even more, some building is destroying random big holes that always in random place start appear, world start to less looking to real and more have strange odd colors. I walking alone in an odd and scary world and getting die every time. The third type of dream is when I can't help someone, someone died and everything, recently I have only this type of dream.

I need to notice that I'm MtF transgender. I notice it that late because I still scared. I want to escape from this endless nightmare, start a new life from a blank page, and finally be myself. But looking at others' lives gives me a thing. I can't complain about this. A lot of people living even worse than me. 

I never talk to a psychotherapist because I was always scared to know to door or just make an appointment. But it has almost no sense, I'll just break my life forever by visiting a psychotherapist because there's almost no way to apply for a job because no one gonna takes a person who visited a psychotherapist. And most of them transphobes, so they gonna hurt me. The other one can't help me since the government looking for rights from transgenders.

I stuck in a circle of self-harm and writing a suicide note. I don't even strong enough to write this post, it was a nightmare for me. And I need to escape this country as fast as I can, because I can't take it any longer, people like me gonna die there.

I say almost nothing about I got bullied on the internet every day or how my government is worst in the world, I tired and you should know that I don't fully talk even about parents, friendship themes.

I feel like a bug without limbs that can't move and do something. Everyone else can draw, programming, make music, and basically anything else. I can't do anything everything that I made is just awful. My poems, lyrics for songs, my site...

I hate the way I look. I can't look in the mirror. I think I'm fat, I hate my voice, I hate how tall I am, I hate my haircut, I hate that I can't control my life, My face and whole body, The way I talk, The way I write. I want to have HRT and control my life so much.

I can't stand for myself and no one can. I can't help myself and no one can.

Everything I can do is repeatedly dying every day. And trying to not kill me. I didn't do anything to deserve all of this. I didn't do anything wrong. 

I forgot to notice that my mom is a transphobe. She said that these people should be in a mental hospital, or better on an island where no one can see them, or even better burn them all!...

I need your help I ask you to find a way to help me! I can't live here anymore, I need to get out.

Heyya!

Im a bisexual cis male, and writing a fantasy series that my closeted teenage self would have needed/ loved. It actually came to me in a bizarre fever dream and Ive been worldbuilding and so on since.

Thing is  I want to do this well. Like, painstakingly so. And Ive ran Into the issue that I dont know enough to portray these characters well. Some I can write, like my pansexual lead. However others Im... less steady on and could really use some help.

Specify sources to read, or a direction to research.

My main cast are:

 A pansexual male with retrograde amnesia 

 A gay male who the pansexual is in love with, but he himself loves another guy 

Aaaaand my issue characters: 

 an asexual male and sorta-in-the-closet lesbian sister

The asexual male has anger towards the pansexual as his crush on Strong Gay is viewed threateningly ( they other 3 were raised as siblings). And the lesbian sister is sorta in the closet due to the culture the book is in.

Basically the 1920s

Is there stories of how lgbt refugees feel/ view the world? Any anecdotes or stories to pass on? Heck any tropes you feel that should be avoided ( or the reverse)?

Yeah. So, I've not had a good time. People have been mean to me lately in the communities. I'm a survivor of multiple forms of abuse and sexual abuse. As a result, I have fears that apparently make me ""transphobic"". I feel safer with trans men because, surprise, I'm a trans man and my trauma is centered around cis men who often invalidated my gender identity! Apparently, me not being ""over"" this fear yet means I don't believe trans men are men. How dare I have a fear because I was sexually abused as a child, horribly abused by multiple partners, and raped. How very dare I, even though I'm actively working on it in therapy. I was *also* raped by a trans man who then used him raping me to invalidate my gender identity and justify cheating on me. That's an event kind of leaves a mark on you, but I've had it invalidated many times and it's also been used to tell me how I ""should"" feel and what my triggers ""should"" be. This has obviously led me to not feeling welcome in the lgbt+ community. I also know of a fair few people with similar traumas who also feel unwelcome.

Now, wanna know what terrible thing I did to get me permabanned from r/lgbt?

I made a post saying people should be understanding and respectful of those within the LGBT+ community with trauma. And then they did something, I don't know what, but the comments saying that they felt the same way, that they feel unwelcome because of this, they're gone.

Yeah. 

And they didn't even tell me what it was I did wrong. Won't tell me now, either. 

So, there you have it folks. They've made their stance on victims of abuse and sexual assault. They apparently don't like them. What a lovely little subreddit they've got going there. ""Safe space"" my ass.

I'm making my own subreddit specifically for LGBT+ people who've experienced abuse. There's already trauma subreddits, but there's a reason some therapists specialize in LGBT+ issues. It probably won't go anywhere. It might go somewhere and turn into a cesspool. I'm doing it anyway. Soon. Maybe I'll post about it here if that's okay. Once I feel better because this experience did actually make me feel like shit."

My Kinda Homophobic Parents,Eh3727,ainbow,"Hello! I wanted to tell you guys about my situation. So...

I've been attracted to guys since I was very young but that was before I knew what it meant to be gay. These past few years I've been more exposed to the lgbtq+ community and with the help of my two closest friends (who are also part of the community) I was able to figure out I was gay.

I'm very comfortable with my sexuality and am out to many of my friends and my two siblings who are old enough to understand my situation (my youngest sibling is 3 atm). They are all supportive. The only important people in my life who I am not out to are my parents.

For a while, I've suspected that they suspect that I'm gay but they don't bring it up much. However, on one occasion, I was watching a video of a gay person and my mom asked what I was watching. I said it was nothing. She then was able to identify that he was gay (probably based on stereotypes) and told me that I shouldn't be watching or associating with gay people even though people in the lgbtq+ community are completely valid. I should know, I am one myself.

On another occasion, I was waiting in the car while my parents were getting groceries. I got bored and called my friend (a girl). We talked until they got back and we ended the call. They teased me about having a girlfriend, which they always do when they see me with a girl. I am more comfortable with girls than I am with guys and I blame my older sister for that. I tried shutting that down by saying I'd never want a girlfriend and my mom responded with ""Then what would you want?"" My dad responded to her question with ""A boyfriend"" (in a joking way). I agreed (also in a joking manner) but my mom proceeded to not joke about that and homosexuality is bad and disgusting that God never meant to be that way.

I think the only good thing that I got out of those situations is the fact that if I come out before I'm independent, they probably would not like me as much. My relationship with them both is sort of rocky, and I don't tend to tell them a lot of things since I don't really trust them.

But yeah. I wanted to tell you guys this just to have someone to talk to it about."

What a solid time during a quarantine to question your sexuality,CreakeyBroomwood,ainbow,"What really started making me question everything is when I saw Matthew Healy [Lead singer of The 1975] in the music video of [Love Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ5bZuUlftI) at Hardrock Cafe in NYC...woof.

I've never had anyone to speak to about attraction and/or anything sexual honestly in a  comfortable environment.  I've had I guess 'feelings' for both women and men throughout my life, what I mean is I don't know I can't describe it. It was just something about them that made me want to get to know them, be close to them, etc.

Basically I've always felt that I want to be with someone I feel comfortable with, that I don't always have to watch my back with and I don't really have any problem with the idea of making out with either gender. But here is the thing, I've never gotten sexually aroused to anything outside of porn and any sort of sexual dream I have my body forces me to wake up or shift away from it instinctively.  Like the only time I've ever gotten sexually aroused or 'hard' outside of porn and/or non-risk/taboo induced scenario, was when I was sitting next to senior guys in the school library who ended up talking about their dick sizes.

Idea of being with a girl isn't not appealing, like [SFW example] (https://i.imgur.com/qAx8Pqm.jpg) is appealing to me.

Idea of doing something with guys as a guy doesn't totally gross me out.

[SFW Example] (https://i.imgur.com/IGL4EPJ.jpg) Like the only thought running through my mind when viewing this selfie is how I'd like to push them down on a couch, undo their belt, unzip their fly and look up at them from my knees before servicing them basically thinking about stroking a guy, feeling him and hearing them moan makes my breath hitch as a warmth spreads in my stomach but I don't get hard.  Admittedly the thought of having another guy sexualize my throat and/or rear is kinda appealing but I've heard its not all that great like sucking on a meat flavored banana that you can't bite and like a wet handjob, but weaker plus I gag on a tooth brush :/ and when thinking about anal insertion in reality whether with dildos, fingers, lube, etc. I can't get passed the messy and unsanitary imagery though I've heard there's lots you can do without any anal stuff?

What really intimidates and scares me is if I do get involved with someone that I won't be able to 'perform' if you will, I guess I'm rather submissive and I really get off on ejaculation shots and creampies but I've heard sex is generally overrated, a lot of weird noises and how you're turned off when you pull out.

Basically I'm such a sheltered virgin that I had never actually seen abs on a guy in person before until my senior year when a jock was showing off at the hotel pool, then again when you go to a school where glances can get you bashed your eyes tend to stay on the ground [A location I spent the majority of my life believing I deserved to be, six feet of ground] and you get changed as quick as possible.  My um jaw kinda hit the floor if that means anything.

Had an intense dream about auditorium stages, a blue haired guy was performing, we locked eyes and I walked off stage stopping midstep before the next verse. Then I was skating on the connecting stage which could be seen from the side stage the blue haired guy was performing on flipping off landing on a group of chairs sideways. Then the blue haired guy noticed me and started singing too me, attempting to get me to come on the stage but I refused and someone in the audience was saying that I shouldn't. Then the performance ends but I can't let it go, next I was interrogating another guy I figure knew the blue haired guy asking where he was; finding out he was attending a strange party. When I arrived there was a 'Host'/'Bouncer' who controlled everything taking me to the blue haired guy in another room. Said blue haired guy had a sparkling blue patch Adams style clown nose on, noticing me gave a chipper hey but all I could do was stare at his lips and then he got so close I could feel his breath on my lips then something happened at the party and we separated.

Had a weird dream last night about sitting next to a guy at a table. their face was obscured, they were kinda emo-ish i guess. we were awkwardly chatting with whoever was a crossed the table from us, i reached my hand under the table like i was going to start rubbing him through his pants and then i woke up

Had a dream featuring a girl that i guess i had a crush on in 11th grade. we where walking down the school hallway side by side just awkwardly talking back and forth, i think about how she was dealing with losing her brother that was in the military [in real life her brother was fine in the military far as i know]. then everything got weirdly tense. she stepped in front of me, kinda putting her hand on my chest. she leaned in kissing me, then i started sliding my hand down the front of her jeans and then i woke up.

Had a dream about a guy that i guess i had a crush on in 11th grade featuring me in the back of a car freaking out sobbing with him opening the door reaching his hand out to me resulting in me backing away from him in fear.

Had a dream of drooling over a fictional version of a guy with abs taking off their shirt in the summer.

Had a dream about an attractive Arabic guy who I followed into a labyrinth style library in which we just talked and I found myself wanting to make out with them, maybe more.

Had a dream about a guy blowing me but I felt nothing then woke-up [I should've written this one out after it happened that was months ago :/]

Did he like me?,Huhuhhuhh,ainbow,"My First Love was a ""Straight Man"" That Went Down Hill. Did he like me?

Intro:

Hi everyone, hope you are all doing well. I am 22 year old gay man and currently reside in the United States. Where do I start with this? So basically I decided to go to a private university after high school, which was far from my home. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone so I could meet new people and make connections without being near my family. Within the second day of moving on campus,  I had received a message from a random guy on Snapchat (Mass group add during orientation that summer) asking if I would like to go to an event on campus with him. The only person I knew at the time was my roommate, so  I agreed. During this time, I was only focused on two things. Friends and Grades. Me and him were very awkward when we first met. He was this masculine guy that always looked mad and then I'm this scrawny feminine guy that you could tell was gay from a mile away. Little to no talking, walking through big crowds during the event. Background about me is that I suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder, so once I couldn't find him in the crowd,  I left and went back to my dorm. He messaged me shortly after asking me when I went and I had told him I was looking for him but could not find him so I went back to my dorm (which is the most meanest thing I've done to somebody). He said that it was alright and asked if I wanted to get breakfast later and I agreed. 

August to December:

So fast forward from August to December, we are becoming great friends and he likes to hang out with me all the time, which I was not used to. Then November hits and all hell breaks lose. I start feeling something warm in my chest when I was around him. I started developing feelings, which is very rare for me. He always wanted to go on adventures and go to the movies and dinner. He even took us to go see Christmas lights and he had Christmas music playing in the background. I'll never forget that. He had other friends but would sometimes ditch them for me. I'm not anything special so I was confused. In classes he would change seats to sit with me and wait outside until my class was over. He trusted me with a lot of his things. So December comes along and he was going out of the country for winter break. He asked if I could run his social media streaks and I agreed. So once I logged in, I was at the top of his streak list and it had a heart emoji. I was in shock but he would text me everyday  while out of the country  telling me what he's done and how his flight went yadaddada. He got back but there was something that I needed to tell him....

January to March:

At the beginning  of January, still winter break for us, I told him I was gay (i didn't say i liked him but I was gay). Considering his background and morals, I explained to him that he didn't have to be my friend anymore if it made him uncomfortable and that I completely understand if he doesn't. He tells me that were still cool but he doesn't ""go that way."" This took a lot of weight off my chest and so I looked at him as a best friend rather than someone I see myself dating in the future. So people are moving back on Campus and I haven't heard from him in about 2 days, since I came out. And I forgot to mention, It was my birthday the day I got back to campus. So basically I'm in the mindset now where I'm in the motions of him slowly dropping me as a friend. My phone buzzes about 30 minutes away from Campus and he asks if I would like to go to dinner with him. I'm kind of nervous but I agree. He takes me to one of my favorite restaurants but on the way there, he doesn't bring anything up about what I had said 2 days ago. We get there and we  get a table. We just talk about our winter break and how it went and then boom. ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!"" The waiters and waitresses surround me  and sing happy birthday to me. If you knew me and my family, they never really celebrate my birthday. So this was so freaking special to me. I tried not to cry but I did and gave everyone a thumbs up that I was okay. He then got Ice cream with the birthday desert I got and started eating it. But here's the kicker he gave me his spoon so I could taste the Ice cream. I refused. He paid for my meal and I told him he can't do that but he wouldn't let me split the check. I ended up secretly paying him back by putting my cash in his armrest without looking. Things start to get a little crazier from then on. He started calling me rather than texted me. He started to get jealous when I was with other guys, said things to me like ""you're the only person that gets me."" Not even that, but usually when we go to the movies, we would see an action film. But there was this one time  he bought us tickets to see  ""The space between us"" and I've never heard of it so I thought it was another action movie. Not only that but his friend asked if he could come last minute and he got so angry with him for no reason at all. The friend decided to come and my friend was quiet the whole time with his arms folded. It was a romance  film. Of course I start developing feelings for him all over again but considering he was straight, I didn't want to fall for him. So I started trying to distance myself away from him but it always failed. So there  was  only one thing to do.

April to May  (The last time): 

So in April, he wanted to become roommates for next year and then wanted to look for houses off campus with just the two of us. I gave him my ID pin so he could pull me in as a roommate under his account. After that happened, I started to think to myself. I'm about to move in with someone that doesn't  like  me the same way I like them. I texted him how I felt at 1:30am. The message was on  the lines of ""I like you but we can't be together because I Know you're straight. This is going to ruin our friendship so you need to find another roommate. it's goodbye."" And I know that text was very harsh but I had all type of emotions running through my head. I wish I could've reworded it but it was too  late. I sent this on Friday morning, where we didn't have classes. I drove home because I could not bare to be on campus. 3 days go by and I'm on campus that is completely empty. He hasn't texted me  back. He constantly viewed my Snapchat stories and Instagram stories but never replied to my text. The day before my last exam, I walk to my car that I parked in an empty parking lot. As  I'm getting situated in my car, he pulls up next to me. I freak out and drive off because  I was so scared of  what he might do or say. Still no text. Still viewing my Snapchat and Instagram stories. Move out day comes along and I guess we both though alike because since we were trying  to avoid each other, we both took the other exit. We walk  past each other and he stops and asks if I needed help and I told him no (I am a very stupid person as you can see). And that was the last time I talked to him in person. I had texted him again that summer to remove me from his roommate list but no reply. I had blocked him on everything after him constantly viewing my stories but not replying.  He tried following my friends back at home that he didn't know so I told them to block him. And yes, I did get a new room and roommate. Me and him never talked again. I cared for this man and  he was my first love. All his flaws turned into positives and liked everything about him. 

About a year later, our mutual friend comes to me and tells me all the bad thing's he said about me and how he blocked me on everything for social media. He said he hated gay people and that they disgusted him. It broke my heart. I don't know if I broke his. He probably didn't care that much. I never was the same again. I never got closure (which a lot of people don't), but I always wondered did he like me more than a friend? I am still moving on but it's  tough. He was really the only person in my  22 years of living that actually got me."

[Rant] questioning -- please help !!,bunbananabread,ainbow," hi! I've already posted to another subreddit before but wanted to repost in hopes in getting more replies/advice. I don't normally post online, but I'm getting desperate for advice. Also I'm sorry this post is going to be long, but I feel like all the details are necessary and It's been a long journey of questioning :( 

I've been questioning my sexuality for about five years now (I know, a long time) and I tried to put it off and not think about it during the first few years because I was scared about how other people would react if it turned out I wasn't straight. Anyway, now during quarantine I decided to face this head on. The one thing I know for sure is that I'm attracted to girls *(I'm a girl, btw*), which took a while to admit bc I realized I've repressed my sexuality for years by trying to justify the straight label for myself. This has, unfortunately, caused me to gaslight all of my feelings and attraction, which makes it harder bc I feel like I'm going to war with myself. I even tried to tell myself that straight girls are attracted to other girls, so it doesn't make me non-straight (crazy, I know).

To explain my sexuality a little further - always been attracted / had crushes on guys, and I'm attracted to girls definitely, &amp; know I could do things with them, however, my issue is that I don't know if I could ever date a girl. This is why I've been trying to figure out if I'm bisexual, if I should just label as queer, or just not label at all at this point. By recognizing that I'm definitely not straight, I tried watching / reading more LGBTQ+ content. I watched 'everythings sucks' a while ago, which kind of opened my eyes for me, because I realized that I was very much attracted to Sydney Sweeney *(not just her character, the actual actress*), and I got super happy &amp; butterflies during the scenes with her &amp; the other girl together. I remember during two particular scenes I got so happy &amp; blushed because I realized I wanted to BE the other girl dancing with Sydney Sweeney, and I think that was a real eye opener (*\*\*\*this was also the first time I've ever been attracted to an actress before, except maybe Megan Fox(?)).*

Anyway, there's more but this is getting too long. During my first years questioning I especially restricted myself to picking either straight or bisexual, which was harmful bc I didn't feel ""bi enough"" so I ignored it. Now, I know sexuality is fluid &amp; I don't mind labeling as queer either, but I just want answers tbh. I also have this issue of ""imposter sydrome"" I feel like I'm faking the whole thing and tricking myself - which has been really hard to sort through. This was really hard for me to post &amp; I appreciate if you read the whole thing through - any advice is appreciated!!"

My sexuality is pretty clear to me, like I know I can love any gender. But the real problem here is I've been questioning my gender a lot lately... Like I'm a girl or am I???? I've been reading a lot about gender identities but I dont know... I'm feminine but not toooo much that's so confusing!

And like sometimes I think that I may be ""forcing"" myself into the LGBTQ+ but I don't know, it's complicated, also my mom would never accept me. She already knows my sexuality but she doesn't reeeaaally likes it. Plus I'm kinda young so like... Can i question my gender already? Ugh it's so complicated!

Ok so I am kinda feminine and I like it but sometimes I wish really hard I was a boy and I like to be kinda masculine, but I don't like to use he/him pronouns.

Well I just needed to let it out, if you have any advice I'd be grateful I guess. Well, have a nice day! :)"

"Do you think I am straight, gay, bisexual, pansexual, omnisexual, asexual, apasexual, etc.?",CreakeyBroomwood,ainbow,"What really started making me question everything is when I saw Matthew Healy [Lead singer of The 1975] in the music video of [Love Me] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ5bZuUlftI) at Hardrock Cafe in NYC...woof.

I've never had anyone to speak to about attraction and/or anything sexual honestly in a  comfortable environment.  I've had I guess 'feelings' for both women and men throughout my life, what I mean is I don't know I can't describe it. It was just something about them that made me want to get to know them, be close to them, etc.

Basically I've always felt that I want to be with someone I feel comfortable with, that I don't always have to watch my back with and I don't really have any problem with the idea of making out with either gender. But here is the thing, I've never gotten sexually aroused to anything outside of porn and any sort of sexual dream I have my body forces me to wake up or shift away from it instinctively.  Like the only time I've ever gotten sexually aroused or 'hard' outside of porn and/or non-risk/taboo induced scenario, was when I was sitting next to senior guys in the school library who ended up talking about their dick sizes.

Idea of being with a girl isn't not appealing, like [NSFW example] (https://i.imgur.com/WyVIzfj.jpg) is appealing to me.

Idea of doing something with guys as a guy doesn't totally gross me out.

[SFW Example] (https://i.imgur.com/IGL4EPJ.jpg) Like the only thought running through my mind when viewing this selfie is how I'd like to push them down on a couch, undo their belt, unzip their fly and look up at them from my knees before servicing them basically thinking about stroking a guy, feeling him and hearing them moan makes my breath hitch as a warmth spreads in my stomach but I don't get hard.  Admittedly the thought of having another guy sexualize my throat and/or rear is kinda appealing but I've heard its not all that great like sucking on a meat flavored banana that you can't bite and like a wet handjob, but weaker plus I gag on a tooth brush :/ and when thinking about anal insertion in reality whether with dildos, fingers, lube, etc. I can't get passed the messy and unsanitary imagery though I've heard there's lots you can do without any anal stuff?  Another [NSFW Example] (https://i.imgur.com/bTN6lil.jpg) I don't not find appealing.

What really intimidates and scares me is if I do get involved with someone that I won't be able to 'perform' if you will, I guess I'm rather submissive and I really get off on ejaculation shots and creampies but I've heard sex is generally overrated, a lot of weird noises and how you're turned off when you pull out.

Basically I'm such a sheltered virgin that I had never actually seen abs on a guy in person before until my senior year when a jock was showing off at the hotel pool, then again when you go to a school where glances can get you bashed your eyes tend to stay on the ground [A location I spent the majority of my life believing I deserved to be, six feet of ground] and you get changed as quick as possible.  My um jaw kinda hit the floor if that means anything.

Had an intense dream about auditorium stages, a blue haired guy was performing, we locked eyes and I walked off stage stopping midstep before the next verse. Then I was skating on the connecting stage which could be seen from the side stage the blue haired guy was performing on flipping off landing on a group of chairs sideways. Then the blue haired guy noticed me and started singing too me, attempting to get me to come on the stage but I refused and someone in the audience was saying that I shouldn't. Then the performance ends but I can't let it go, next I was interrogating another guy I figure knew the blue haired guy asking where he was; finding out he was attending a strange party. When I arrived there was a 'Host'/'Bouncer' who controlled everything taking me to the blue haired guy in another room. Said blue haired guy had a sparkling blue patch Adams style clown nose on, noticing me gave a chipper hey but all I could do was stare at his lips and then he got so close I could feel his breath on my lips then something happened at the party and we separated.

Had a weird dream last night about sitting next to a guy at a table. their face was obscured, they were kinda emo-ish i guess. we were awkwardly chatting with whoever was a crossed the table from us, i reached my hand under the table like i was going to start rubbing him through his pants and then i woke up

Had a dream featuring a girl that i guess i had a crush on in 11th grade. we where walking down the school hallway side by side just awkwardly talking back and forth, i think about how she was dealing with losing her brother that was in the military [in real life her brother was fine in the military far as i know]. then everything got weirdly tense. she stepped in front of me, kinda putting her hand on my chest. she leaned in kissing me, then i started sliding my hand down the front of her jeans and then i woke up.

Had a dream about a guy that i guess i had a crush on in 11th grade featuring me in the back of a car freaking out sobbing with him opening the door reaching his hand out to me resulting in me backing away from him in fear.

Had a dream of drooling over a fictional version of a guy with abs taking off their shirt in the summer.

Had a dream about an attractive Arabic guy who I followed into a labyrinth style library in which we just talked and I found myself wanting to make out with them, maybe more.

Had a dream about a guy blowing me but I felt nothing then woke-up [I should've written this one out after it happened that was months ago :/]"
Hello!,nunofurbizness214,ainbow," 

I am a gay Asian American in my mid-20s, born and raised in Dallas, TX, and not entirely out of the closet. Only a few people know, such as my childhood best friend and her family, my mom, and my work bestie. No one else knows about my personal life. I am so lonely, and people often think I am great because I appear very happy and outgoing on the outside. They think because I have a good job and career, that I'm well educated, make a comfortable living; however, they don't know that I sometimes cry myself to sleep at night because I long to be with someone. I've never had a significant other, and all I want is for someone to hold me, to brush their fingertips across my cheek, gently rub my back and grab my hand. I feel so helpless because I don't know when I'll find somebody to love, and if I'll ever have someone to love me back. I am used to being alone because I am an only child, but I feel lonely. Being alone and feeling lonely are not the same. I've never been to pride and had built up the courage to go this year, but COVID happened. I also planned to go explore the ""gayborhood"" and hopefully meet some genuine LGBT friends that I don't currently have.

I am not your typical gay, where I long for anonymous hookups left and right. I want a relationship that could lead to intimacy. I know I am not the most fabulous looking gay Asian as in I'm not the typical feminine, short, Asian twink that most people visualize a gay Asian as. I am too masculine to be feminine and too feminine to be masculine. I am just me. I am considered a taller Asian at 5 feet 11 inches and currently have a stocky build. I am working with a fitness trainer to get into shape, but I'll never be the 130-pound twink nor be the hot jock with six-pack abs. Dating has been painful as someone I would like does not like me back. I tend to be attracted to taller, masculine guys who have the same life ambitions as myself. I would think that having a post-graduate educated partner, with a high paying career, a sense of stability would get at least a few dates going. Oh, how wrong am I?

Well, thanks for listening to my rant and hopefully you have some tips on how I can be more successful in dating."

being gay in japan,Diplocriterion,ainbow," I'm an international student studying in japan. i understand that being a foreigner here means getting stared at. However ive been wondering lately if these two particular japanese dudes are staring at me because they like me or something.

I've got dark brown hair, fair skin, western looking. I wont describe myself as good looking, because i dont think i am. other people do think that way about me though for some reason.

Person 1 studies in the same building as me. a few times when we are in the same elevator, hed turn his head to look at me then turn away when i glance at him. this has happened a few times already. the other day he cycled away from me and turned his neck twice to look at me. swear he couldve snapped his neck given how much he turned but luckily he was ok hahah

Person 2 works as a cashier at the supermarket and i always catch him looking at me lately eventhough there is a sea of people sometimes. he talks in a feminine way abit and walked that way too the other day.

Anyone knows how to tell if someone is gay here in japan? before someone says ""just ask them"" let me tell you that in many asian cultures,especially japan, it is taboo to be homosexual and culturally people here are not so open in general with other matters too apart from sexuality. would love to get to know these two people a bit more.

thanks"
Research survey for gay men's mental health,Bedevilled_Ben,ainbow,"Hi all,

My name is Ben, I am a gay physician working in a community mental health center in New York. I am conducting a survey of the mental health of cis and trans-Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) during the Covid-19 pandemic. I would like your help by participating in my survey!

The survey consists of about 30 questions through Google Form, should take &lt;10 minutes of your time, is totally anonymous, and has no financial incentives. The purpose of the research is to help deliver more targeted mental health treatment for things like depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts to cis and transmen having sex w/ men in the community, in the current times of Covid-19.

We are also investigating if there has been changes in things like time spent online, time spent socializing, time spent using drugs, or alcohol, etc. Reaching a larger audience through /r/ainbow would be immensely helpful to our study. All data will be available to the public after the study is done, and I'm happy to re-post once the paper is published. The insights we gain from this study will be returned back to the community: to psychiatrists, psychologists, psych nurse practitioners, and other mental health providers working within the LGBTQ+ healthcare community.

If you would like to take the survey, you can access it through Google Form here:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLaFKq3ewqpeAHkRVcK8pg5-6tqkFyYjIGSTj0NT_gH7DGUw/viewform?usp=sf_link

Thanks for your time! If you have any further questions please feel free to let me know, I'm happy to answer any questions or concerns.

PS: Mods, I reached out to you last week about posting this but never heard back.  Since this is a lightly-moderated forum and I didn't see any rules against posting surveys, I figured I'd chance it.  If this is against your rules please let me know and I will delete ASAP. Thanks!

Need help in being an understanding parent if...,Fantastic_Intention5,ainbow,"Ok so I (31F) was putting on makeup the other day which I rarely do but anyways my 12 year old son walks in and comments to me ""You know mom I might be one of those weird boys who likes to wear makeup"" I calmly just asked ""what do you mean weird boys."" He then explained that when he gets older he wants to make YouTube movies with his friends (what kid doesn't nowadays). So I told him that all actresses and actors do that. He was surprised and asked what about John Krasinski. I told him yep even him. Then I turned to him and point blank asked him, ""do you mean the kind of makeup I have on? That you like that kind of makeup?"" He shrugged his shoulders. I said ""ok, just asking."" and that was that...

A little backstory for him, he has always been a wear his heart on his sleeve type of kid and so aware of the people around him and how they're feeling (an empath I guess). Anyways along with that he is a little more feminine than his friends from what I have noticed and have even told my Mom that if he ever ""comes out"" someday, I wouldn't be surprised. She has the same attitude as me on the matter that we will love him the same no matter the case.

Now the help I need is the fact that I was raised in smaller rural communities and there really wasn't a whole lot of LGBT knowledge instilled in me as I grew up. I DO NOT want to say or do something that will discourage him from talking to me about this as he discovers himself. Also we are a christian family and I know some intolerant people unfortunately, I also luckily know some very encouraging and amazing people as well. I don't want that environment to discourage him either. But his relationship with God is a big portion of his identity right now as well, he wants to be a pastor some day. So here I am stuck in the middle so to speak with little knowledge on how to handle it IF he ever does come out. He could just be a feminine male and that's ok with me too. I just want him to always know that his Mom has his back no matter what in life.

So hopefully I haven't said anything that could be considered offensive and if I have I do apologize, like I said I have little knowledge in these matters. TIA for any advice you can offer this Mama."

My gay best friend (20M) are planning to sign up for Reddit to find queer communities or group chats &amp; meet new people there, since we live in a homophobic country people wont really come out that easily (hence so hard to find communities like that).

Anyone know if there are LGBT communities or group chats to meet new people? As all the communities/group chats we encountered are well...sorry to say..full of horny people...

What he like to find are fellow LGBT friends &amp; maybe potential SO. BUT it doesnt need to be specifically for dating or meeting potential SO.

"Its been a long time coming but I finally told my father how I feel about him, and I did it where all my siblings could see.",Playtek,ainbow,"
TLDR: I came out when I was 17 and was asked to move out. Im almost 40 now and finally had had enough of my fathers homophobic bullshit to call him out on it. It felt good to get that off my chest.


I grew up in a very religious and strict home for most of my life. My father would drag ya to church every Sunday, he would do bible study before school twice a week and we did youth group as well, we would have mens retreats at our house for members of the church. We would plan out vacations around doing church activities ect. It sucked, I hated it for the most part and wanted nothing to do with it. I knew my father was very anti gay, but I knew at a young age that I was gay. There was some internal conflict but by the time I turned 16 I was out to friends and when I was 17 that news made it home. Mom and dad were pissed and asked me not to come home, I didnt for a few weeks, eventually I did but only long enough to pack up my stuff and move out for good, this was my senior year of high school, I managed to finish and graduate with a modest 3.0 gpa. I move in with friends and eventually with a guy I was seeing. I had a job and a car was was doing fine, a couple years go by and my mother reaches out to make amends and we were working though those feelings when she passed away. I went to the funeral and my father did his best to ignore me. Within 9 months my dad was remarried to a woman from church, he invited me to the wedding, I assume his wife was the driver in the invitation. She is a nice lady, and has always treated me with respect even when my father didnt. He seemed pretty off put that I bothered to show up to his wedding. So after the wedding I moved on once again and didnt have much contact with him for many years. About 7 years ago my young niece passed away suddenly and I flew down for her memorial. My father was there as were most of my siblings. He was polite at best, but we didnt interact much. It was another year before I saw him again at my nephews 21st birthday. At this point though I was now in a 3 year relationship and we had recently gotten engaged. He did not attend the funeral but he came with me to my nephews birthday. My father was outside when we arrived and he walked up and said hello, I said hello back and then attempted to Introduce my partner. He turned and walked away mid sentence. My partner jogged past and got between him and my sister house and introduced himself and forced him into shaking his hand. My father sulked in the corner for an hour before he left ghosted.  Its been a few years since that happened and we havent spoken since. 


About a month ago I deactivated my Facebook account to take a break from it and today I went back to fully delete it since a few a few weeks I didnt miss it. Before doing that I went into messenger to respond to things people had sent and to let them know I was leaving and how to contact me in the future. I came across a thread that my sister in law had sent to me, my siblings and my father, they had a conversation and it was done. A few days after that conversation my father posted into that group that we should all watch the video from Trump in Tulsa, and speaking highly of the speech. 


That was the last straw for me so I composed a long comment about how hypocritical my father has been over the years. He always preaching love thy neighbor, compassion and forgiveness, yet he supports this racist, sexist, rapist. I let him hear it all, and detailed all the mistreatment he has put me though in the past 20 years.  I then promptly deleted my Facebook account not wanting or expecting a reply. It felt good to lay bare all that pent up bullshit. Plus I got off Facebook for good, 2 birds one stone. 


Just feels good to get that off my chest.

"Homophobia in High School, Mid-1970's Style",BarryDMill,ainbow,"**Yes,  sir. Thank you, sir. Excuse me, sir. Lately, Ive been greeted  with these and similar courteous remarks more than ever before  by  everyone from salespeople and doormen, to waitresses and pizza delivery  boys.**

**And I find it jarring.**

**Dont  get me wrong. I do appreciate receiving such acknowledgments from the  Gen-Xers, Millennials, and Zoomers with whom I come in regular  contact, as well as from my contemporaries and elders.**

**But heres the problem. Even though I recently turned 62, I still do not feel like a sir.**

**At least not yet.**

**And I wonder if I ever will.**

**In  my memory, it wasnt so long ago when a contingent of my high school  classmates would jeer, Hi, homo, Yo fem, and other similar niceties  at me while I rode the bus to and from school; scurried up and down the  hallways and stairwells; and fumbled through gym class.**

**A  day didnt go by when I wasnt teased, ridiculed, shoved, or physically  threatened by a small army of my rotten peers who were fixated on  making my life miserable. And they succeeded brilliantly.**

**What  they lacked in intelligence, couth, and humanity, they made up in  athletic ability, brawn, and sadistic perseverance. If anyone had asked  them at the time why I deserved their abuse, they probably would have  justified their actions by claiming:**

**(1)** **Hes a weakling.**

**(2)** **He sucks at sports.**

**(3)** **He walks, talks, laughs, examines his fingernails, and holds his textbooks like a girl.**

**(4)** **Hes a damn Jew.**

**And  they would have been right. I fit all of the above descriptions and  others that didnt jibe with what they deemed to be acceptable,  all-American male characteristics.**

**Yet,  there were times when some of these same bruisers quietly propositioned  me when nobody was in hearing distance. I figured they were setting me  up, hoping I was so desperate and lonely I would take them up on their  offers. And if I had, they probably would have squealed with delight,  howling to one and all that there indeed was a queer in their midst!**

**The  truth is ,when I was 14, 15, and 16, I didnt fixate on my sexual  orientation. Was I gay? Straight? Somewhere in between? I had no idea  whether I preferred girls or boys and I really didnt care. And I did  not pray to G-d every night before bedtime to make me normal, just in  case I chose the latter.**

**After  most school days, I would come home feeling shaken and dejected,  needing a nap to decompress before dinner and homework. Had my life been  adapted into one of those heart-wrenching ABC Movies of the Week I  watched during the mid-70s, my character would have undoubtedly been  hooked on drugs and alcohol, or involved in some cult group like the  Moonies. Id probably be shown cutting classes; swiping money from my  parents dresser; sparring with my older sister; peddling flowers on the  street; and/or even attempting suicide.**

**Somehow  I managed to avoid all those pitfalls by burying myself in my studies. I  guess my nice Jewish boy genetic makeup or strong survival instinct  veered me away from such self-destructive behavior.**

**Whatever  it was, my homework became my raison dtre. I managed to tune out each  days disturbing events and focus entirely on my overnight assignments,  whether in my bedroom, at the kitchen table, or at the local library.  It got to the point where Id get teary eyed if I didnt receive all As  on my exams or report cards. My good grades were among my few  accomplishments that gave me a modicum of satisfaction throughout my  freshman and sophomore years.**

**Upon  my return to high school in September 1974 for my junior year, I  noticed an immediate, palpable change all around me. It seemed as though  the toxicity that had permeated the classrooms for the past two years  had mysteriously disappeared.**

**My  former enemies had been transformed into pod people over the summer.  Their acrimony toward me had been replaced with geniality; their  rudeness with civility; and their homophobia with nonchalance.  Apparently, their hormonal levels had leveled off.**

**In the process, they abandoned me. I assume they reckoned, Why waste time on** ***him*****, when we could be pursuing girls! girls! girls!**

**Of  course I was elated and relieved. However, after receiving a steady  diet of unwanted attention from my antagonists for two years, suddenly  being left alone felt unsettling and, strangely enough, even painful.  All the time and energy I had previously invested in protecting myself  and staying emotionally afloat was now no longer needed.**

**To  fill in this new gap in my life, I sought out several after school  activities. Fortunately, my school had both a student newspaper and a  yearbook. The volunteers from both clubs warmly welcomed me. Channeling  my creativity into these two publications kept me busy and helped me  adjust.**

**Since  then, more than four decades have vanished since I flung my graduation  cap into the sky after accepting my high school diploma. Even so.**

**In  print, films, and pop songs, Nietzsche has been paraphrased: That  which does not kill us, makes us stronger. For some people, this may be  true. For me, not so.**

**Occasionally,  I still experience post-traumatic stress arising from my mid-teen years   no matter how many sessions of talk therapy Ive undergone or how  many doses of Celexa, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and Effexor Ive  ingested over the years to reduce my depression and anxiety.**

**At  times I feel as though Ive never really grown up; that Im actually a  kid with gray whiskers; that my inner child never matured. I have to  remind myself that Ive managed to assume adult responsibilities and  have handled them well.**

**Among  my proudest accomplishments: living with the same man for nearly 30  years and marrying him in 2008; founding a public relations agency with  my husband, which has employed dozens of freelancers throughout our  existence; helping my sister care for my elderly mother during the her  last years; and volunteering my time to LGBTQ causes. The list goes on.  And yet I have trouble taking credit.**

**As  my face and body wither and my dark brown hair fades to gray, Im both  amused and bemused by the fact that now Im receiving more deference and  acceptance from acquaintances and strangers alike than from any other  period of my life.**

**Maybe  its because I live across the river from liberal Manhattan Island.  Maybe its because our building is filled with an educated, diverse  group of people. Or maybe its simply because older persons, like  myself, no longer draw much attention, whether were straight, queer,  white, black, or brown.**

**Whatever  the reason, Im grateful. I can live openly and honestly with my  spouse. I dont need to pretend we are just friends or brothers when  we go food shopping, out to dinner, or on vacation. I can even request a  king size bed at a hotel without feeling any embarrassment.**

**So,  in conclusion, being a sir has its perks and privileges. Still . . . I  feel uncomfortable being addressed this way. But, you better believe I  prefer it to hey, fag any time.**"

"Why as an athiest member of the LGBTQ+ community, I have stopped giving anti-LGBT realigious people respect.",Zooscopyy,ainbow,"No TL;DR so pack yourself in.
TW: Transphobia, Enbyphobia and Anti-semitism

For a while now as an atheist member of the LGBT community, I've always tried to give the benifit of the doubt to realigious people. While I may not fully agree with their points and opinions I've always considered them as basic human beings and gave them respect and dignity for who they are as a person, and I always played the card of ""as long you're not doing harm to others do whatever you want"".
But quite recently it's been a really though time to try to support their views.

Here are the main things I've heard from realigious people after coming from a very new specific tweet about pronouns by ""A famous person I shall not name because I don't want y'all to harras those people because it wont solve anything"" (the tweet itself isn't harmful but the replies are dogshit), and most of the replies played out the same by those realigious fucks :

""I have no problem with the trans community, but I will not force myself to call you something you are not. It goes against everything I'm for, and my religion.

If you are born a man, I will refer to you as a man, 

If you are born a female, I will refer to you as a female.""

Pro tip: If you ever find someone saying ""I have no problem with ______ and then proceeds to tell a problem they most likely have a problem with said group.

First of all no one is forcing you to do nothing, we simply suggest and want you to be able to validate us like we validate your realigioun.
Second of I'm pretty sure thier is 0 mention of using a trans persons' pronouns correctly in the bible, so that kinda contradicts your point. But don't worry sweetie, you're not going to hell because you refer to people by their pronuons. (If there are any realigious experts out there, correct me if I'm wrong).

And then finally they will cry about how realigious people have such of a bad reputation.
People like you are literally the reason why jewish, christians, muslims and realigioun overall has such of a shitty name for themselves.
It's because of people like you that are weaponizing the bible against us, and that are so toxic and yet so narcissistic that you only want to give ""God's love"" to people who fit your shitty ass Invisible Sky Daddy narrative.

I'm fucking done giving realigious people favors &amp; the so called respect they deserve, because they fucking don't, they want that ""respect"" so they can jerk of to themselves about how much of an amazing human being and going to heaven, when in reality they're clearly not.

homophobic mom,Queerhumor,ainbow,"Dear all, 

I wanted to share my experience around my queerness (I identify as bisexual, but like girls more) and experiences I have had with my homophobic mom.

When I was 19 years old, I came out as bisexual. The reaction of my (latina) mom wasn't great to say the least. A lot of anger and cussing happened from her side. She never acknowledged my girlfriend at the time, and described her as my best friend. I have confronted her about her behaviour, but nothing changed. When I was around 20, I went on dates with girls, but I (almost) never mentioned it to my mom. Since she was still behaving the same way. One time I said I had a date, and she excitedly started searching for the perfect outfit and shoes. But when I told her it was with a woman, I could see her facial expression change from happy to annoyed. I am now 22 years old, and she is still behaving the same way. I wonder if it will ever change, I look foreward from hearing from you all, and the experiences that you have had with your family. 

Also, I feel like I experience internalized homophobia sometimes. I just started digging into this area, and I started thinking about it after I was afraid to come out at work, even-though there are other queer employees working there. That made me wonder if more people experience this after a bad reaction from people that are close to you. 

I wish everyone much love and health &lt;3

Would it be a good idea to break up with someone you really love and who loves you because of homophobic parents? Do you think dating online is safer then in person for people with homophobic parents as in my situation? (nevermets relationship),FriendlyWorldliness1,ainbow," 

If your a closeted shy gay person, lives with over protective parents who wants to move to a very small homophobic island, parents won't even let this person to meet friends (before the pandemic), doesn't have time to go out much (And the pandemic itself is another reason) and have homophobic parents. And plus moving out of my family is something very very far in the future. **That person is me.**

Anyways, I met someone online and we developed feelings for each other. I don't want to break up with him and my heart is telling me yes for him. I know it's possible we can meet in the future. But my parents homophobic/disapproval voices in my head are preventing me. I know some people are against the online relationship thing but I'm okay with it. And I know some people would say long distance doesn't work. And I know some people might say this is the reason why closeted people shouldn't date.

Any advice here? Btw, I'm 19"

I was abused by the Las Vegas Police,knockedthefuggout,ainbow,"The State of Nevada is (factually) the absolute worst state in the entire United States to receive mental health treatment... due to a lack of funding and a lack of humanity. Thank you for your work, Rawson-Neal. I am not afraid of going to Hell anymore. That old fear of mine, being condemned by God to go to Hell, is completely gone. Im in my 30s. Thats not normal. I already know that Im never going to Hell, because I was already there. I found Hell. Its right here on Earth. Its called Rawson-Neal psychiatric hospital. Their address is 1650 Community College Dr, Las Vegas, NV 89146. This is the same Las Vegas psychiatric hospital that was caught sending patients away to Los Angeles on a bus in order to get rid of the overflowing crazies, because these people are incompetent monsters. I could have become another member of Skid Row in South Central Los Angeles because of these people. When I was arrested by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and sent to Rawson-Neal psychiatric, I was missing my wallet, my insurance cards, my debit cards, my credit card, my AAA card, my PADI Open Water diver card, my car keys, my apartment key, my mailbox key, and my LG Android smartphone my drivers license because I was having a manic episode when I totaled my car in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA on July 30, 2019. The fine people of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Rawson-Neal psychiatric hospital could have easily killed me with their incompetence. And they would have gotten away with it. These people treated me like a stray dog. All of them. The police, the inmates, the patients, and the healthcare workers failed to treat me like an intelligent human being. All of these fine people treated me like an animal that they wanted to have put down at the vet. They just wanted me to shut my mouth and make themselves feel powerful. The people at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (Downtown, 200 Lewis Ave) also attempted to register me as a sex offender.... even though I had, and never have, done absolutely anything of that nature. I was at the police station due to a car accident, not because of any sexual misconduct. During my manic episode (Bipolar I Disorder) these monsters booked me and compelled me to register as a sex offender. I believe that they assumed I was a sex offender, and forced me, against my will, to register as one... simply because I was wearing a snake-print Joe Snyder thong underneath my shorts when I was arrested, and not because I did anything even remotely sexual whatsoever. These motherfuckers preemptively registered me as a sex offender because of a fucking thong. Im a bi-curious law-abiding citizen of Las Vegas who had a bad day. Are you fucking kidding me? What ever happened to innocent until proven guilty?! You are not supposed to register innocent people as sex offender, wait for something to come up to get them, and then unregister them from the sex offender database after nothing comes up.
I have an exceptional memory despite the fact that I was, at the time, suffering a nervous breakdown. I even called the Internal Affairs Office at LVMPD. I talked to Detective Jose D. Martinez, Internal Affair Bureau. Their address is 400 S. Martin Luther King Blvd, Las Vegas, NV, 89106. The LVMPD/Internal Affairs Bureau main office number is 702-828-3422. That worthless twat detective was about as useful as a marzipan dildo. Not to mention he even cut me off before I could read back the arresting officers number to identify the police officer who arrested me. Well here it is in permanent, published form: 07/29/2019 ID# 0007085248 Name: SOBRADO, MICHAEL Officer 1566 C8172B of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department was my arresting officer. He can corroborate my story. I was unable to sign the paperwork because the police restrained me to a chair, put a net over my face, taunted me and mocked me while I was in a clearly vulnerable position (like a man having sex with a woman), and forced me to face the wall for what felt like hours. The morally-deficient animals at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department have absolutely no idea whatsoever how to treat a thirty-one-year-old man with Bipolar I Disorder and Aspergers syndrome, intoxicated on THC or not. Not to mention after all that horseshit, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department just could not fucking help themselves and humiliate again on a Sunday morning while I was out running errands: getting a car wash and some donuts. These thugs with badges and panda-painted Ford Explorers arrested me again. On 16 February 2020, I was pulled over and arrested on a surprise bench warrant regarding my car accident all the way back on 29 July 2019. I was never informed that I was supposed to show up in court, by anyone. Absolutely no one informed me. I received absolutely nothing in the mail. No summons notice or anything. Nobody informed me. Not the shitty cops, not the shitty legal system nobody. I was forced to spend yet another 3 days in jail at the exact same jail I was brought to last time on 30 July 2019. I showed up in court, got my instructions, paid my fines, got a stupid breathalyzer installed in my new car for six-months (even though I didnt drink any alcohol at the time), and did everything I had to do to downgrade my DUI for THC into reckless driving. Im now a free man and Im homeless at the Courtyard, which is at 314 Foremaster Lane, Las Vegas, Nevada 89101 and I absolutely regret moving to Las Vegas this last May 2019. This wretched city has been nothing but cruel and unusual to someone like me: a guy just wanted to move somewhere fun for a single adult. May God have mercy on the City of Las Vegas and the Nevada State Government for the way they have treated me, an innocent man, for the last year of my miserable life.

I'm a transgender french student and I feel helpless,feelinghelples,ainbow,"Hello. As told in the title I'm a 23 yo bisexual french student which, as my username indicates, feel helpless. Let me sum it up. 

 As far back as I can remember  I was bullied at school for being the weak gay twink boy in a private catholic school. When I attended High School I started to have ""sugar daddies"", who lived in the closet and payed me for sexual relations which I can see it it now was not something  I should have done but anyways.  
 I quickly moved out as soon as I could and had what we call here a ""license"" (3 years at college) and was going to continue my studies. I had a girlfriend (still is), friends (which was  something new for me) and everything was bright. But you can't just dig your traumas away. So 2 years ago I made a suicide attempt and was placed under medication ( Paroxetine and Xanax FYI) with a psychological and medical follow up.   
I worked on my mental health with them, traumas etc for two year but something was still off. I couldn't explain why but I always had the feeling that it was getting better but off. As if I was learning a tune but the tempo was quite dragging. One of the reason is because I think I'm transgender ( Maybe I'm just using it as an escape door for all my problems idk). I talked with them about it and they told me they couldn't help me about it because they weren't qualified. My closest friends know about that but I can't start transitioning because I think I should be in stable money and psychological situation before I do it. I was beat up three time just because I was wearing  nail polish (Fuck me right ?) and even if I know they were assh\*les and I'm telling ""Yeah I'm proud"", I went to LGBT group who told me ""FUCK THEM BE PROUD HON"" I just end up crying in my car. Pride isn't going to stop making them following me home   
They stopped my antidepressant a month ago and this feeling of being off is growing on me. I tried to talk to my psychologist who was great for all this time and he said I was making things up (Which isn't something you should say to a lost patient idk seems kinda unprofessional). I tried to call the hospital which is following me and they told me ""Yeah... That's too bad...  But we can't do anything more \\\_()\_/ "". I'm so fucking scared to talk to my friends and my girlfriend about it because if i have one more "" Be brave ! We're with with you and not going to let you down ! Anyway let's talk about something else "" I swear to god I'm going to make a post on Reddit (Wait a minute.....)   
In a month I'm going to start a formation for a recruitment competition to become high school teacher (Which in France  is f\*cking hard my life will be only about it for a year or maybe two) and in my mental health condition it will be hell. I made the decision to transition in 3 years when I will have a stable revenue, a job etc. And I have this obnoxious feeling that two people are fighting inside my mind. One is the one who want stability, a job, a wife etc and the other says ""yeah ok that's but you lost your time and youth. In 3 years you will have a job, a house etc And nothing will ever change. Ever."" Which is scary, I'm not talking about something like ""LET'S TAKE DRUG AND HAVE SEX WITH 5 MEN AT THE SAME TIME"" just this feeling of being stuck in a car to a destination and I missed the last opportunity to turn left is scaring me.  
So I can't stand being stuck in this body, the medical help I had abandoned me and I can't talk to my friend or family because they don't understand the fact that I'm scared. It's 3 AM and I'm writing a post on Reddit because I have no fucking idea where I should go or if someone can help me.  


TL;DR I'm stuck in a body I hate and on a highway to a ""normal life"" and I feel alone and helpless"

Do you think doll lines need lgbt+ representation?,roadrollar,ainbow,"Honestly I think it's stupid. Most doll lines don't have a proper canon. I mean you can literally just say a doll you or your child owns is a lgbt doll. No one is stopping you. The doll most likely doesn't have a canon sexuality or gender. It can be whatever sexuality, gender or gender status you want it to be.

So yeah I think it would be pointless.

But monster high has lgbt dolls. That's cool. But that doll line has a canon. Unlike barbie dolls where there is literally rather none or a million.

"ANONYMOUS PLATFORM FOR BLACK, QUEER PEOPLE TO SHARE THEIR STORY AND VENT",theclosetunlocked,ainbow,"The Closet Unlocked is a blog platform for Black, queer folks to anonymously share their stories of being in the closet. The purpose is to highlight the strength of that journey instead of the negative, and to show others that they are not alone in their experiences.

This will hopefully bring more awareness to the journey that black queer folks experience while being in the closet. When a person comes out, they are celebrated for making such a brave and strong decision. However, we rarely show recognition to the strength that queer people, especially youth, have during the moments before. Instead, the closet has been looked at as a negative thing for both our community, and to the public. Its time that we change that narrative. 

Each week, an anonymous story will shine light on the struggles and triumphs that LGBTQ individuals have faced throughout their lives. It will give us a voice to openly talk about a part of our identity that we have denied for too long. These stories are for anyone who needs them. For those who have felt alone in your experiences, this is to show that there are other people that have been in similar situations. This journey is different for everyone, but you are not alone. The closet is not a place of weakness, it just makes you feel that way. It is the foundation for your gay pride, and all you need is yourself to unlock it. 

Each week a new story will drop that will be a combination of lived experiences and various information and resources.

""CW: police brutality, transphobia \[and support needed   \] 

  
On the morning of July 14, police in plain clothes came to the flat in  which our member - Margot stayed in as a guest. They first threatened to  bust the door, and when they were let in they didnt give a reason for  their intrusion, nor allowed their information to be written down. 

Then they brutally dragged Margot out of the flat  in her pyjamas (without shoes, socks or a sweatshirt), and took her to  an unmarked car, threatening her with abuse and death, calling her a  f\*ggot and a loser. 

Only after countless of people and NGOs  intervened, did the D.A. reveal Margot's location and that she was  charged in connection with the destruction of a homophobic truck.

Margot was held up all night, and released the next day by the court,  without arrest. But right now he needs help most - for a lawyer for  herself and for other people at risk, as well as for further actions of  her collective.

"(x-post from r/lgbt) Need advice. I'm the head of my companies LGBTQ ERG, and I'm tired of being the face of DEI for and performing for straight people.",queerandtirednow,ainbow,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

When  I first started at my company, there were half a dozen openly LGBTQ  people. We worked together to launch an LGBTQ ERG (employee resource  group) to connect with one another and host educational, celebratory  events. Despite a lack of support from execs, and some  not-so-professional anonymous survey responses questioning our  existence, our group went well and our events got a lot of positive  feedback. Our group was brought up in interviews and added to the  company website as proof of our inclusive culture, with LinkedIn Pride  posts including a rainbow version of our logo and all that good stuff.

Over  the past few months, one by one, each member our group has either left  because they didn't feel supported, or got laid off. Currently, I'm the  only one of the original group left. Several new people joined the group  including two very recently hired LGBTQ folks (both very shy/quiet),  and a couple of straight people who want to be allies. Here's where the  problems are (from my perspective):

\-  While the allies mean well, they have kind of taken over and started  leading all of our discussions and planning during meetings. I don't  know how to point this out in a way that's not going to come across  poorly or potentially turn into an HR issue/scare them away. When you're  an ally, you should be a listener and supporter, not a leader. I'm  white, and if I were to be in a POC ERG as an ally, I sure as hell  wouldn't tell anyone what to plan. I really think they should step back  but I don't know how to say it to them, or if it's even right for me to  think this way.

\- The other issue  that I think stems from this one is that I feel like our events, and our  groups existence at this point, is just performative for the straight  people to feel good about themselves for being supportive. I don't feel  like we should even have an ERG with this small number of actual LGBTQ  people. It's a lot of stress and unpaid labor on our part. It used to be  fun when there were more of us and we were all more involved. Right  now, all three of us who are actually LGBTQ are just stressed and sad  about the state of the world and don't feel like planning anything.  Which is probably also why the allies have taken over during meetings.  The way it is right now, it feels like we are just faces that act as  proof that the event is really about/for us when it isn't. The events at  this point are planned by straight people for straight people.

I  would really like to put the ERG on hold, or convert it to something  like a support group for LGBTQ employees. However, I'm afraid the  company will push back if I try to plan things that exclude allies. I'm  also afraid if we disband, it will end up hurting people, like LGBTQ  candidates in the pipeline who are counting on the group being here, or  people in the closet who feel safer knowing our group exists. I know HR  won't like it as it's bad for our image to have an ERG suspended, though  to be honest they have been so unsupportive (bare minimum funding, no  exec sponsor because they are all ""too busy"", turning down so many of  our requests to make the company more inclusive) that I'm at the point  of not caring what they think.

I  could really use some advice. I was planning to start off by organizing a  coffee chat with the two other LGBTQ people to share how I'm feeling  and ask what they think, though I wanted to organize my thoughts a bit  more and get some perspective before doing so. Thanks for reading my  ramble."

I beat up a white supremacist at my friends birthday party,gaygunner91,ainbow,"Okay so Ive known Julia for about three years now. She knows Im a gay and interracial, and it had never affected our relationship dynamic, until she started dating Brett.

Brett is a fuckboy Julia met by chance right as you know what was hitting hard. Julia was never the best at picking men, which is something she is aware of and had been trying to better about, but Brett was far worse than any of them.

What happened is this: I met Brett at Julias birthday party (there were less than ten people attending), and I could immediately tell something was up about him. He made a point of looking down at me - so to speak - when being introduced to me (Im shorter than he is) and he had a disconcerted look on him when he looked at a pride-related pin I had been wearing that night.

He was very short with me, and dismissed my presence as quickly as he could, and he scurried away to take a couple shots. I asked Julia whats wrong with this one and she said so far, nothing, I hope. and skirted around how his introduction to me was rude.

The night wore on, we were having fun for the most part. Then someone else at the party discovered Bretts twitter account and found a series of racist and homophobic tweets. The kind that argued that police brutality is justified against people who dont know their place and how allowing gay people to live freely will be the downfall of humanity.

Julia isnt on social media so it makes sense she wasnt aware of this.

It should be noted that while Im not black, Im also not white. I look ethnically ambiguous but its very clear my ancestry isnt entirely European.

I called out Brett on his shit and he called me an anti-gay slur and a half-breed.

In response, I lunged at him, punched him in the gut then face, and pinned him to the ground, shouting at him while I threw punches. He may have been taller, but I was clearly stronger, especially because I had taken him by surprise. I saw genuine fear in his eyes.

The whole time Julia was **screaming** at me to stop. Everyone else was completely silent and frozen. I did eventually relent (after getting a few more punches in) and his face was already starting to form bruises and he had a bloody nose. There were two broken glasses on the floor. When I looked at Julia she had a facial expression I had never seen her make before. She looked heartbroken. I figured she really liked this guy and she finally realized just how scummy he was. 

She angrily kicked everyone out then and there, myself and Brett included. On my way out, I shouted at Brett (who was looking for his phone) that Id do a lot worse next time.

That was Friday night. Its Tuesday and I still havent heard from Julia. Brett deleted his social media profile (from what I can tell). The other people at the party gave me a range of feedback, from you did nothing wrong, to you took it too far, but Im not mad at it to youre lucky you didnt get arrested and frankly Im a bit afraid of you now.

From Julia? Nothing. Notta. Ive reached out and called multiple times, she doesnt reject my calls but she lets them go to voicemail. From what I can tell she is talking to very few people at the moment; the only thing Im certain of is that she broke things off with Brett."

[NSFW] Controversial topic question because Im curious: how do yall feel about straight people watching gay porn of the opposite gender (girl watching gay guy porn and vice versa)?,Glossyplane542,ainbow,"Personally, as a mostly gay guy, I really dont give a shit and dont understand why anyone would give a shit, its porn, its made to be enjoyed by whoever wants to enjoy it, lesbian porn isnt just made for lesbians and gay porn isnt just made for gays. However, 2 people that used to slightly semi be my friends-ish recently tried to cancel my other friend because shes a girl and is really into gay male porn, and I just dont see it in the slightest and think theyre massive assholes for trying to do so.

Edit: also side note, the 2 people question were FTM trans, which is perfectly fine and valid and all but I feel like this really isnt their place to say to speak for every gay male (as in bio sex) when its not their bio sex."

Im an asexual lesbian and Im tired of being invisible.,aigret,ainbow,"Im almost 30 years old and had long since given up on trying to understand who I was. I have had sex with both men and women trying to get it and have had successful romantic relationships with womxn (only). I had considered myself incredibly well-versed with the LGBTQ+ community but asexuality was a fairly new/vague concept to me until this year. I frankly didnt have any knowledge about it and Ive never met anyone who identifies as such. When I was a kid and classmates were forming crushes Id tell them that I didnt know what that was like. That has morphed into never being sexually attracted to anyone - ever. People to me are just ...human. I havent had sex in 10 years and Im totally fine, despite the opportunity arising.  

I feel like Im playacting every time someone talks about how hot someone is or points out something that turns them on. Its hard for me to imagine anyone as a sexual person and I just cant keep up with those conversations. Its like being born colorblind - not only do I not know what Im missing but its incredibly frustrating trying to relate to people who do. Spending my entire life living like this has been difficult and isolating, to say the least. 

What really bothers me, though, is the lack of representation within the LGBTQ+ community. If you google bi, or lesbian, or even demi, plenty of resources, articles, and communities come up. Instagram pages, Facebook groups, really active subreddits. And Im just over here like ..Id like to understand myself better and find others who do, too. 

The friends I have come out to dont seem to get it, even the ones I have told for years that I dont experience sexual attraction (and talk about lack of representation - Ive been saying that my entire life and no one brought up ace once). Somehow the new label of asexual Im using is off-putting. Does that mean you wont ever have sex or dont want a relationship? is a common response. The friends who knew me in my experimental phase are especially rejecting. But how can I ever help those close to me, even my queer friends, understand it if I dont even have the resources to understand it better myself? Alloromantic/homoromatic asexuality seems especially elusive. 

Does anyone have any resources on this or can point me in a direction I might have overlooked? How can I be a better ally to fellow asexuals? Am I getting this all wrong? I mean ABSOLUTELY no hate by this post - the queer community has felt like home since high school. I just want to be better included now, too."

I came out to my religious family and I need advice,flarpatar,ainbow,"My family is religious and theyre of a certain religion that I dont really want to say which because I dont want to bring it in a bad light somehow. However, I was born and raised into this religion and I dont hate it lol. However, Ive had this internal conflict for years because since I was very young Ive always felt the same way about girls that I do more and as Ive grown older Ive even realized that Im attracted to them more than guys. Anyways, this has always been hard to come to terms with because of my religion and I spent a good while of my life ignoring these feelings and by luck I met a friend who was gay and helped me come to terms with my feelings and I can honestly say that accepting this part of myself has made me feel better about myself. When I ignored this part of me it honestly made me hate myself and I even expressed this to my mom when I came out. 

I came out to my family because my girlfriend and I broke up recently and my mom walked in on me bawling my eyes out. She wouldnt leave until I told her what was wrong and I did eventually even though I was absolutely terrified. And she of course brought up god and the Bible and everything and it only makes me feel worse because I know these things I know them very well, my parents used to read me the Bible to sleep. 

The point is that I feel stuck, and I feel even more stuck because I knew all of this was going to have to come out but I didnt expect to do it alone because I thought I would have my girlfriend to have my back but thats obviously not the case anymore. It has also had a extremely big strain on my mental health and I know I need help but I dont know how to get it and I know this isnt the place but I just need to vent lol. My sister has even told me that now I have a choice do I stick with the religion if I feel that I can ignore those feelings or persuade the other lifestyle and it just makes me awful."

The deep dark hole inside me,Minewolf_ST,ainbow,"This is my first irl kind of post so I'm kind of nervous. But after today I just felt I needed to do this. I had a really hard few days were a lot of the things I thought are special about me were taken from me. I had a very good talk about a lot of this with my mother this evening (as she thinks about the past daYs similarly) and the thought came up to come out to her. I didn't however, as I felt it was not a good time (given the past few days and the late time of day). Also I am not sure about my father's reaction because everytime the topic of homosexuality comes up (unrelated to me as my parents (obviously) don't know yet) he kind of ends it with ""whatever they are just very few anyway"" (translated from german so not exactly his words). 
All of this leaves me with the feeling of a deep dark hole inside of me. And I don't know what to do from here. 
I started to question a lot of my (lifestyle-) choices in the past few weeks prior to all of this, which now just leaves me lost somewhere nowhere.
I know that this is a lot of more or less related stuff but with the recent events I just needed to vent all of this which accumulated over the past time."
AITA for destroying my neighbors anti-gay sign?,rpdrconspiracy,ainbow,"So Im gay, fortunately still employed and working remote, been staying at home with family in the suburbs for the past three months

The neighbor who lives across the street put up an anti-gay sign conspicuously on the first of the month, conspicuously barely a few days after my parents put up their pride flag.

My neighbor is an old asshole who always insulted me when he saw me after he learned I was gay back in high school (ten years ago). He hasnt changed at all and when I came back in May I overheard him shout [wifes name] the f*g is back in town!

Most of the neighborhood started ignoring his antics long ago as he and his wife have burned a few bridges with their bigotry, but every fucking day when working remote I had to look at that fucking sign (quoted the Bible, shows a rainbow flag crossed out). It really fucking hurt so much seeing that, so one night I went out and spray painted over it and wrote (in chalk) on his driveway BIGOTS FUCK OFF.

I was not caught, but my neighbor is distraught and is asking around. He accused me of doing first, naturally, but I had an alibi that he bought. Nobody is really giving him any info, either.

My parents arent going to tell him, but they said theyre deeply disappointed in me and said a this isnt how you end hate.

Im not sure what to think here...I get where theyre coming from, but theyre not gay. They dont get it and theyll never be able to get it. They havent had to deal with the neighbors homophobia whereas I have. 

Was I being the asshole?"
Pronouns (and gender in general) in languages,JadenLikesCandy,ainbow,"So, I know that in English the most often used pronouns are she, he, them and verbs don't have genders.

My native language is Polish and I don't think we have anything like singular 'them'. And words usually tell you a gender (example: I did - Zrobiam/zrobiem).

I've been learning Spanish for maybe 3 weeks and I know that 'ella' is she, 'l' is he. Is there any pronoun that works like 'them'?

What is it like in other languages? I'm really curious and I haven't really found anything on the Internet.

30 Heartwarming Vintage Pictures Which Proved That People Have Been Gay Always,gayandlove,ainbow, 
Is my straight friend hitting on me or was he just drunk?,defiantflashlight,ainbow,"So a bit of backstory:

I came out in the 10th grade andI have known this guy since Junior year of HS. he is a few years younger than me and we never really hung out much. I mean every now and nthrn he would show up at a friends house, but it wasn't like we hung out every day.
  Flashforward 15+ years and with the advent of social media we have became ""friends"" on FB. We leave the occasional comment on each others posts and so forth, but haven't physically seen each other in almost 2 decades. 
 Then out of the blue, he messaged me the other night asking for my phone # saying he had something he wanted to show me. Not thinking anything of it I give it to him. He then sends me a total of 6 dick pics. He tells me that he wants me to ""rate"" his package. Mind you I have told him in the past that I have told him i thought he was cute, but i knew he was straight and therefore off the market as far as im concerned. 
 We ended up texting back and forth for the rest of the night. He adamantly claims that he is ""strictly pussy"" the entire time but then asked for pics but ""no dick pics please""and then starts complimenting me on my body tells me he like my scruffy beard and tell me I have a nice ass.... 
 I'm just straight up confused at this point, bros and could use some advice. Should I just assume he was drunk and wanted to give me a tease or do you think he was starting to explore his feelings?"
